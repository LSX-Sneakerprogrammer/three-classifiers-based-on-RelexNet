I don't think so. He won becuase a large independant base and even Republican base voted for him I am one of those. His ideals and policies are too radical and he may have a tough time getting re-elected. His best hope is that the GOP does a bonehead move and put another McCain Palin like ticket. IF someone like Bob McDonell runs I think Obama will lose.

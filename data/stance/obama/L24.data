Sure you intended it that way, you most certainly did, by the slams you made.  Obama is the nutball. He is a liar.   Now I don't know where you are from...but if you are an American...I will personally pay for a ONE WAY TICKET just for you if agree to leave the country and NEVER COME BACK. Then you can live in one of those perfect countries that rely on America to come to their defense every time something happens. Yes, go live in Iraq where there are no atrocities and where you can enjoy freedom to say whatever you want. Go to a country where you can't own a gun...to defend yourself.   I tell ya people like you make my stomach turn....you bash America and would be the first one to hide behind one of our servicemen if we were attacked. You obviously love Obama....tell me, has he BROUGHT ALL THE TROOPS HOME LIKE HE PROMISED? Is American presence gone from the Middle East, like he said would happen? Gun toting? Didn't Obama join in on the attack against Libya? Who was totin a gun then skippy?  All the men and women who have died since he took over president he is responsible for. The blood is on HIS HANDS NOW. Where are those outspoken democrats who voted for him because they were told, no promised, that he would END THE WAR?

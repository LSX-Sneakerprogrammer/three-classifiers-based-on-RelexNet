I claim over and over that Republican representatives dress the policies of greedy oil and insurance overloads in populist talking points like "global warming is made up", "drill baby drill", and "oversite is socialism"   I claim over and over that Democrat representatives dress the polices of health care and business with talking points like public duty and responsibility and equality.   and trick silly bastards like yourself into voting one step closer to the caste system of have and have nots which is the ultimate inescapable conclusion of any purely capitalist society.   Republicans haven't trick me into anything. They are idiots. I am for personal freedom.  I don't vote Republican. Well, I did vote for Ron Paul. That is it.   Unfortunately it is harder to explain.    If to hard to explain, then there is probably really nothing to explain.   Yahoos only understand bumper sticker talk - hence Palin is the front runner in GOP polling right now.   Luckily, I am not one of those.

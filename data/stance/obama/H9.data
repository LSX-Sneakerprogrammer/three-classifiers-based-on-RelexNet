Obama was hoping, perhaps naively... could leave safely.   Yea I thought so. But, was that not the same problem that kept troops in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was dealt with?   This is the reason why... it is ever spent again.   That does make sense, but when has that actually happened? Surely this has failed more than succeeded?

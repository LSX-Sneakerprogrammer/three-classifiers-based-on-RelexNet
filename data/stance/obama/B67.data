I'm from england and Americans need to give him more time, he has had to sort out the massive mess bush left and also deal with mad people calling him the anti-Christ. he has managed also to do what bush never managed to do in taking down osama bin laden a man who killed over 3000 innocent Americans. your country has got better since he came in and he deserves some credit, calling him the worst president in American history is the most stupidest thing i have ever heard most of the people going against him are only going against him because he is black, no other reason.

Obama has done something he has created more uncertainty and more job losses because of uncertainty on big tax programs. 80% of all unemployment is from companies 500 or less.   Recent poll asked business owners from all sorts of industries about their business and if they are thinking of hiring.  Overwhelmingly the answer is no. Small business is not going to hire when they are facing a possible huge carbon emissions tax. If health care goes through another 8% tax.   The game plan right now of the President is to add more tax to a already hurt economy. If you have a business and the only talk out of Washington right now is not to help private business but only make it more expensive to do business why would you spend more and hire an employer. This is the lack of common sense that I talk about with Obama policies on the economy.   Remember the lie and we all knew that is was BS that if his stimulus was passed that unemployment would stop at 8.5%. Thank god we only have 4 year terms. I hope that someone comes along a worthy opponent unlike Jon McCain in my opinion was a horrible choice for the GOP . If it is someone that's a worthy opponent Obama will be like many other past Presidents a one hit wonder.

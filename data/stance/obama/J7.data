You could refute my argument by showing either that I am wrong in my assessment of the consensus opinion of economists or showing that accepting this consensus is wrong for some reason.  You have thus far attempted (unsuccessfully) to do the latter. But you haven't provided sufficient evidence (or any at all really). Your refusal to accept the opinion of qualified experts reflects a greater anti-intellectual trend we're seeing in American politics (particularly among conservatives). In effect, you are advocating ignorance. And judging by the fact that several people have upvoted you, you're message is appealing. The fact that you are persuading people to do things that would make us all much worse off, pisses me off quite deeply.

obama wont win but what difference does it make who wins? whoever gets elected will carry out the orders of the corporations just like all the others. civil liberties will continue to disapear, the u.s. will continue expanding their military. it will start new wars with people. rich people will get further tax cuts. you can call me nostradamus.

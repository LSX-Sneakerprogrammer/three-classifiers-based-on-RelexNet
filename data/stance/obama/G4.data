Um Warlin there no excuse Obama he is so far of base that he is lacking the ability to communicate with his own party. Even with both the House and the Senate majority to his power still can't get any of his big agenda passed. I think people crack up when he says something like "I'm going to close Guantanamo" He sounds naive when he says stuff like that then he tries to and realizes oh shit this is harder than I thought. No country wants to take them back. No shit dumb ass.   Obama is one of those really smart men that has all of the accolades but lacks some basic common sense.

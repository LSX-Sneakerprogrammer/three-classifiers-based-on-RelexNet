Wilson was pretty bad, and so was Buchanan. Carter gives Obama a good run for his money (or should I say other people's money) but I have to say Obama is without a doubt the worst, most spendthrift, most disengaged, incompetent and inept President I've ever seen. An outstanding stump politician, but completely devoid of leadership skills.

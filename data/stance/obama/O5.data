It's funny how everyone blames the Republicans for this recession. "Blame the Republicans. It's really their fault." That just shows how uneducated everyone in his fan-club is. The simple fact is that every single one of the last presidents saw the recession coming, but no one really knew how to stop it. Now that it's here, Obama doesn't know how to fix it. The fact is that the fault crosses party lines. However, Obama had Congress in the palm of his hand for two years and they did everything he wanted. They authorized bailout after bailout, and let him spend as much as he pleased. Now common sense can tell you that when you don't have any money, you need to stop spending as much. The Republicans won't agree with him because he spends way too much and won't negotiate. Negotiating actually involves BOTH parties giving up something they want so that both parties can get something they do want.

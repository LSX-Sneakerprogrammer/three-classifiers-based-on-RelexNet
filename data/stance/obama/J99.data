That is a really bad argument.    He is with abortion and yet he has children!!!!   So what?! Is his wife pregnant? For all you know maybe she had an abortion at one point in your life. Saying something is ok for people to do doesn't necessarily mean you are going to do it yourself. You make it seem like all pro-choice activists hate kids, which certainly is   NOT   true!

President Obama, sense the time of his election has fallen drastically in my opinion... he has shown himself to be arrogant, far from anything close to By Partisan (with the exception of pushing for the bush tax cuts... which is commendable) , his foreign and domestic policy's have been either against the will of the people or for big controlling (intrusive) government... and now he's looking to give amnesty to illegal immigrants... i.e. rewarding criminals (dream act)!!!???... so for the aforesaid reasons, and others that have not been stated, Barack Hussein Obama is close to worst president in my book.

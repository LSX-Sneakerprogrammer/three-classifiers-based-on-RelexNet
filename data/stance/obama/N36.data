What "lies" and "deceptions" are you referring to, specifically? He's more honest and his presidency has been markedly more transparent (it's one of his hallmarks; see: the White House webpage, e.g.) than his predecessors. Please describe what you are "fed up" with, and whether it's really enough to deserve his not being re-elected.

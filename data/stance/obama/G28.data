Uh he did it is well known and it has been all over the media as well how could you have not heard this? But because of Acorns latest events congress is trying to now stop the Stimulus money from getting there. Lending requirements are the issue of the banks and bond holders neither Bush or Obama had anything to do with tighter lending. Debating isn't stupid it's just fun to hear other peoples opinions. I respect your opinions and beliefs i don't necessarily agree with them but that's democracy, in some countries we are not even allowed to have such a debate. It's nice just to exercise what most people take for granted. I hope that Obama doesn't decide to go bigger into Afghan war instead get out.

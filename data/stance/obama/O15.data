As an outsider with no allegiance to the democrats or the republicans, it would be fair to say that I can look at this somewhat objectively.  To all that consider Obama a failure, just look at some stats. Low expenditure, continued job growth, Iraq conflict over. If that's failing, then succeeding would be miraculous.  Besides, most of his rivals seem unlikely to stand a chance. Whilst my knowledge of US politics is limited, I know that you guys have the following choices: a weak moderate, an extreme Christian theocratic, a radical that doesn't belong on either party, and the other guy. Sounds great.  Obama 2012. It's happening.

Totally, People need to start thinking in terms of - maximal aggrigate demand. I feel like most right wing economic ideas do not promote maximal aggregate demand and thus I question the right wing economic ideas with respect to their intelligence and justifiability with respect to economic evidence and modern economic theory.   progressive taxation inspires greater consumption from the group that consumes the greatest - The Middle Class. It is the best way to accelerate economic activity. As far as i am aware, Supply side economics (i.e. trickle down economics - right wing economics) is contrary to maximal aggrigate demand because it doesnt promote consumption.   Aggregate Demand is the combination of Consumptions, Investment, Govt. Spending, and Net Trade activity. As far as i know, the wealthy invest and consume at a relatively static level as a group. The middle class invest and consume relative to their ability. Progressive taxation increases this ability for the middle class and thus, in order to maximize aggregate demand we need to policies that promote the middle class (typically left wing, socialistic policies).   To me it comes down to patriotism, a patriot wants the whole country to do well. I question the patriotism of the right wing because their policies tend to undermine total economic wellbeing which is fundamental to maximal economic prosperity

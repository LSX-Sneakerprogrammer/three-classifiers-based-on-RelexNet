No matter what happens with Obama's policies, the Republicans have moved too far to the right to produce a candidate with moderate appeal. While the Republican nominee used to be decided with a lot of input from party elites, the far right talk shows have taken over the party since Obama's election. Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh will not allow moderates like Giuliani or Huckabee, or even traditional Republicans like Gingrich to become the Republican nominee. Instead, far right "heroes" such as Palin will dominate the nomination process. These candidates will inevitably run poor campaigns that focus on false and trite attacks that the electorate is no longer as vulnerable to due to the widespread internet and decline of a single, easily influenced mass media. However, the Republicans will give a strong convention that will make people wonder if Obama is vulnerable, until a disastrous performance in the debates eliminates whatever hope they had. Thereafter, the Republican campaign will devolve into infighting and will run out of money due to the poor management skills of its leadership, which will cause all but approximately 40% of electorate, representing essentially tea-baggers, loyal republicans, and mistake voters, to turn against them. Obama will then win by a clear margin.

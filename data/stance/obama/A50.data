Obama was elected because he had a better message   A false one.   and you realize black people only make up around 17% of the population right?   I never claimed that the black vote won his the election, I claimed the media won it.    anytime there is a large turn out the democrat wins, because the democratic platform makes more sense   No, it's because most people are stupid and will only vote when a candidate has massive support from the media.   non-politicals   You mean people who don't care or keep up with politics and have no clue who they're voting for.    actually look at issues without political bias they vote democratic   No, they look only at the individuals without looking at politics. I'm sure Obama is a good neighbor, I just disagree greatly with his politics.

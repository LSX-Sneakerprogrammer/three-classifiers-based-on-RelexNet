I wasn't insulting your intelligence, I was questioning your powers of observation. You may be brilliant but were walking around with your eyes shut and hands clamped over your ears (for brilliant reasons, I'm sure) and thus had no idea what had happened. It was as good an explanation as anything for your apparent perception that Obama hadn't accomplished anything.  And I didn't assume you supported anything. You asked what Obama accomplished, I listed accomplishments, you got offended that I responded to your question. That is the sequence of events here.  And there is a MASSIVE difference between necessary and frivolous government spending and deficits.   Preventing the imminent implosion of the national economy and a plunge into a Depression? That's an environment that    requires    spending to avert total disaster.  Passing massive tax breaks for your rich buddies and bribing seniors with prescription drugs right before an election without paying for them? That's recklessly irresponsible unnecessary spending.

Oh what and George Bush giving tax cuts to the wealthy isn't populist? The whole point of a president giving tax cuts is to become more popular. Bush Sr. raised taxes and he lost the election and Georgie Boy took this too heart and decided that in an attempt to not repeat his father's political mistake, the best thing to do would be tax cuts. Your whole populist argument is flawed.

um..no. i hope to god he don't. he is trying to make schools go year round....screw him. i mean i'm a junior and he doesn't need to go running everyone lives. he needs to get a hobby and stand down as president. in the end someone will take a stand and tell that man how they truly feel about him. 85% of Tennesseans voted for him out of pity. McCain should have won....i would have voted for him if i was old enough.

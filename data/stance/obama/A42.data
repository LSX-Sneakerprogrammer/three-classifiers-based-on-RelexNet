Thinking of the election that was placed you either had to choose from a very old republican canadiate who pretty much followed the steps of bush which probably would not work. Also god forbid if mccain died and palin was president thats a disaster. On the other hand you had a very liberal president and people wanted change and they need it. But now Obama is now president and the media settled down on having a BLACK president (correction half black no1 ever picks that up) implying that does not make me racist only aware. Now America really hasn't all and all changed. The Economy sucks still. Unemployment is up. Foreclosure is up. I mean I give Obama credit he has good ideas but they suck if not putting them to action. Also Bush lost the respect of many foreign countries. Then Obama killed not for personality but just for his race and how a half black man controls a country were the majority is white.........

First off. I am sorry that this website is all you have going for you, but I'm sure treating people like crap on here really helps you get through the day.   Your response to me stating I am here to learn is this.   I can't help willful ignorance.   I was clearly saying I did not quite understand and was looking for a clarification you prick. Yes he did speak of trifle-down economics but in a more general scope he was talking about how a free market doesn't work. Oh and by the way, are you saying that the quote was not &#x10;0 accurate? If not, how in the world is that crap from a bad source.  I am sure you are a very intelligent person and I am sure you are so much more educated on this issue than I, but in the scope of things, you seem pretty miserable so I am fine with where I'm at in life!  Can anyone please explain what other jobs have been created by Obama because as I was saying earlier I cannot see GM being the only factor. Also, I don't mean to be willfully ignorant. I may be ignorant on this subject but that's why I'm here, to learn.

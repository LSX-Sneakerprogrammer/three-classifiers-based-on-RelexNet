He has really tried to get the economy back on it's feet   TRIED?! It IS back on its feet and sprinting. Don't downplay his achievements ;).   $10 billion per year   Uhh... That is PER MONTH!   helping students pay off loans   Obama's already got that covered. He passed student loan reform and is urging congress to extend low interest rates for student loans.   providing jobs for Americans   We are so close to being were we were when he took office. The past year has been incredible for the economy.  Please vote for him even if I can't! Our economy won't survive another republican "Trickle-down economics" president.

I don't see why not. We re-elected squatter George W. Bush after his deplorable performance as President the first time around. All the data indicate the jobs and the economy are rebounding as Obama slowly cleans up after the Republican mess. Republicans prefer scare tactics to data, so I hear many people saying that they're "scared" or "worried," but I invite you to examine the data instead: the economy is on the rise, jobs are on the rise, so-called "Obamacare" has been helpful to many and finally brought us to  even  with much of the rest of the world which has been doing something similar for years, and we are still able to defend ourselves reasonably well despite Obama's less military stance (we DID get Osama during his term, didn't we?)(no, he didn't just "happen" to be president, he helped  make  it "happen"). Unless the Republicans can come up with someone smarter, better, and more Presidential, I will be re-electing him gratefully.

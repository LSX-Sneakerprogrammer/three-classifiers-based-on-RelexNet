A definite 'yes'. It seems a lot of people have 'conveniently' forgotten that the Bush administration pretty much sucked the wind out of our nation (and world), with its 'shoot from the hip' policies. TARP money was first brought up by him, and in case your memory is not good, most of the money Bush received could not even be traced. No one seemed to know where it went! His policies began the process of deteriotaton that Obama inherited. By the time Obama took office, the deed was done, and he was faced with something akin to being given command of the 'Titantic'. Due to his diligence and vision, we are now beginning to 'see the light', in spite of the non-cooperative Congress he is working with. If you know anything about American politics, you realize, the President's power are limited, and dependent upon Congress. In other words, even if his policies were 'perfect', if Congress decided not to support them, they would go no where.  Perhaps the greatest argument' can be found not just in the political arena, but in the totality of the man. Agree or disagree with his actions, you have to give credit to the fact that he is a man who keeps his promises, and maintains integrity in both his personal and professional life That type of man is more likely to succeed for it takes integrity and committment to accomplsh worthy goals. Everyone will never be pleased 'all the time', but if the individual leading is at least one of good moral fibre, and is reasonably intelligent, he will do the right thing which will serve everyone. Obama is such a man.

O I forgot the American people govern how many food stamp programs there are...wrong! all the govts doing, people need to get off their ass and get a job but wait! they can't because obama and the epa etc regulate the piss out of any entrepreneur that shows their face in this administration.   Doubled? Really? No. They have improved but they were at their lowest when obama was in office also.  If you want to be technical no its not called downgrading an economy, its called a credit downgrade which responds from the economy to practically yes it is an economic downgrade. (Sorry had a little argument with myself).  What role did they play, oh please do tell...? It was their fault for the housing bubble right?? they didnt tell us that it was a bad thing the govt was making banks give people money who couldn't pay it back? let's not blame this on our govt or the "flawless" obama administration lets blame it on a CRA.   I don't think you understand the role CRA's played in the financial collapse of the economy.  I did respond..?

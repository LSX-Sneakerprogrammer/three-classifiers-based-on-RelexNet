Progressive taxation is not theft   Any form of taxation is theft.   don’t contribute to economic prosperity as much as the middle class does   Who the hell have you been reading? Keynes? Without the wealthy there would be no middle class jobs.   and all the while are able to enjoy a much higher standard and quality of living.   If they've never contributed then how did they manage to make money in a market economy in which he who serves best earns best (oversimplification, I'll agree, but nevertheless true quite often)?    "uber-sensitive"   That's not what I wrote.   using this phrase as a criticism of something that conflicts with your idea of propriety doesn’t invalidate the truth that what you said is racist.   Truth is subjective.   You appear to be engaging in cognitive dissonance.   Not in the least.   You should learn more about modern racism because what you said was well within the scope of this definition   Whose definition? That of the far-left who think that it is racist not to put the nigger ahead of the cracker (to put it most bluntly)? As a philologist I take very strong objection to the politicization of words.   Government spending cant reflect taxes insofar as we demand something to be provided for by our government   Who is this 'we' about whom you speak?   I agree that it should not be in excess, that it should be as small as is prudent   Yet that which can be thought of as prudent is open to vastly different opinion.   but I also don’t want a dumb president that will do something out of idealism which may have a bigger costs in terms of the overall consequences.   My sentiments exactly, but about Obama.

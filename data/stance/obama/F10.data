(o/t, but why can't I declare a side?)   (Pardon spelling errors)   If you are either undereducated or a non-anglophone, you are forgiving.   he promotes progressive taxation   i.e. Theft.    Are you really that unaware of the fact that he was born in Hawaii?   It was a bad joke.   The notion that he is from another country is at least slightly racist   Nigh everything is perceived as racism in these Ã¼ber-sensitive days.   who is more in support of them than he?   Ron Paul.   taxes must reflect government spending   No, the reverse is true. If the government decides stupidly to waste a billion dollars they should have that billion dollars in the first place, rather than to count on future taxation to provide them with the necessary funds. Ergo,  government spending must reflect taxes  (which ought never be high, or else they'll have a nearly infinite amount of money with which to traverse the world in search of demagogues to kill).   are you arguing that he is pro war   Absolutely. He's getting us involved unnecessarily in Libya, Uganda, South Sudan, etc., etc.   Obama is trying to get us out of the wars we got into under bush II.   All the while getting us into new ones.   as far as i know, these are the way they are because of Bush II.   Which is why I hate Bush, but they've been exacerbated by Obama.   Insofar as Obama is concerned politically, it might be a bad idea to undermine strong counter terrorist innitiatives.   So you are saying that he is saving his own ass, politically speaking, rather than doing what is right. Do you really want a leader like that?

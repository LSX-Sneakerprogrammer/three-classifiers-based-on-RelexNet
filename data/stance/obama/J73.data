"OK lets stop rite now and lets look at Obamas accomplishments."  Well, this is what he's done so far (or what will be done very shortly):  -the Gitmo torture prison will have been closed & the truly guilty from there will have been held to a real standard of justice  -the vast majority of our troops will be out of Iraq (as the American people have wanted for over 3 years now)  -over 4 million more children will be insured through SCHIP  -new research will have been done using new lines of embryonic stem cells  -the economy will be roaring back after one of the worst recessions in almost 100 years  -the American auto industry will be on the mend after being re-focused on making products that Americans truly need in the long-term  -credit card companies & financial institutions will be under new regulations to prevent Americans from being ripped off in the future  -better relations will have been established with Iran & Russia  -a massive reform of our health care system in the USA will have been passed that will not allow health insurance companies to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, to cut off coverage for people that get sick, and to monopolize health insurance costs by denying Americans access to real competition for their health care dollars  -more Americans will have health insurance coverage  -more Americans will be paying less in payroll taxes  -more investment will have occurred in truly renewable, clean, and infinite sources of energy  And who knows what else will be done by 2012...

He only ordered the feds to review things. Not to take action.   Let's see...   Federal support for stem-cell and new biomedical research   More taxes?   New federal funding for science and research labs   More taxes?   Funds for high-speed, broadband Internet access to K-12 schools   More taxes?   New funds for school construction   More taxes?   Visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office   So they can circle jerk and talk about how to ruin their countries.   Expanded the SCHIP program to cover health care for 4 million more children   More taxes?  The list goes on and on. I see more money being spent. Not saved.  Read what your going to post before you actually do; analyze it.

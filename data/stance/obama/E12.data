Actually I've finished 16 "grades of school" - A average  Ad hominem attacks aside, that chart I have linked is from the same source used during the Bush administration. This tricky math you are accusing the link of using is simply not true. There were 200,000  net  jobs created. The chart shows  net  loss/gain.  That more of the unemployed begin again to look for work, and so are again counted in the percentage of unemployed - keeping the numbers aproximately the same, in no way negates that jobs were created - it just means we have a messed up way of counting unemployment rates. You can thank Regan for that by the way, one of the many tricks his corporate overlords used to pad Regan's scores while he acted like a President.  And the point is not that jobs had been created every month, I just mentioned that new numbers were in for January. The point is in spite of Republican economic policies bringing the strongest economy in the history of the world practically to its knees in 8 short years, Obama in 2 short years has managed to at least slow the bleeding.

Your infatuation with Obama is either blinding you completely or you are purposely distorting facts.   Tea Party weirdos   It is weird to believe in constitutional govt. If you think they're weird, give us reasons, or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot (someone who makes decisions without facts).   this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration.   OK, I don't know if this is a purposeful lie or you just don't see this. Tax rates have actually gone up for almost everyone paying taxes, but we are in a massive recession, so tax revenue is down. Your statement is true but is a huge manipulation of fact. Ironically, your point only proves why the Bush tax cuts should be extended: by lowering taxes for certain income brackets, the govt tax revenue actually goes up.   2. Spending has actually been cut   No. Sure he cut the f-22 program, but the stimulus bill, health care, and a myriad of other programs have skyrocketed federal spending. This is just not true. Sorry.   3. Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it   So if everyone else is doing it we should too? Most of these countries are having financial meltdowns because of massive deficit spending.   4. Due to the stimulus package, the economy is improving. Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Again, no. First of all, 200,000 jobs gained in January are census jobs mostly. Second, the stimulus package contained almost NO stimulus. It CANNOT stimulate the economy because it was almost entirely pork barrel spending and was "stimulus" in name only. That aside, we have clearly lost jobs, as unemployment has gone from 6% to 10%. Where did that 700 billion dollars go? And even if we did add jobs, 700 billion for 200k jobs? It would be cheaper to give $1 million dollars to every american.  Anyway, I'm gonna skim and end, because I think I've made my point.   1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending    Political double speak. While he drastically increases spending he attempts to make himself look good by ordering reviews.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   see above.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   while bills like the 1 trillion dollar health care bill are done completely behind closed doors.   1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House   He said. But we have seen the heaviest lobbying in White House history under his regime.  Anyway, point being almost everything this man touches turns to dust. The "budget neutral" health care bill has now been revealed by the CBO to be a 1 trillion dollar deficit. We are spending 150% of our GDP in deficit spending (Greece is collapsing at only 119%). He passed student loan reform and no one even knows what it means. You say this man will go down in history. This is undoubtedly true. He will go down as the man who in four years decimated the US economy.

Yeah... people who don't know what they're talking about like Nobel Prize winning economists.   http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/08/ opinion/08krugman.html    Quick! Go teach him about economics!  Also, just to address an earlier nonsensical claim you made that I somehow missed properly ridiculing... let me get this straight. Conservatives who scream and cry and stamp their feet any time anyone even MENTIONS the word "taxes" are the fiscally responsible people who know that things need to be paid for, and the people who are fine with the need to pay taxes to actually pay for things don't want to have to pay for things? Or is just the fact that I personally got a nice big rebate this year the thing that means  I  don't want to pay taxes? Either way, that's just spectacular reasoning. Bravo.

Obama has owned the economy for almost a year now and has done nothing but make the long term prospects for itsâ€™ recovery worse. You may not believe it now with everyone in the financial media claiming that the boom times are back, but all Obama did was borrow from our retirements and our children's and grandchildren's futures for short term benefits that will disappear once the government stops propping the economy up.   Instead of focusing on jobs and the economy, Obama is worried about Health Care (I.E. How do you tax the rich and middle class when they are losing their jobs) and Cap n Trade (if you tax businesses, they will just lay off more people in order to pay the tax) two things that will only make the economic problems worse. In addition, stop blaming Bush and the Republicans solely for this mess. Much of the problem was created by Democratic led efforts to force banks to loan to individuals who were nowhere near credit worthy (Obama was once a lawyer who sued banks to make loans to people who could never pay them back). Maybe if you took your partisan blinders off and did some research yourself, you will see that we have elected one heck of an incompetent liberal as President, one who promised to do things differently and then went ahead and did (is doing) things the same old way they were done in the past, with more gusto than any of his predecessors.

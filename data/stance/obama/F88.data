If you're a proponent of fiscal irresponsibility, debt, unemployment and malaise then absolutely yes.   Which is why Obama has spent very little in new spending and unemployment has dropped 2% since its peak.   Also if your politics tend toward the fascist/communist end of the spectrum, again yes.   And now it is clear you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Communism and Fascism lie at opposite ends of the right/left-wing spectrum.   But if you believe in freedom   I believe strongly in social freedom, which is why I support Obama.   and the Constitution   yes   and the God given rights of man   Excuse me? Umm....God-given? Forgive me for thinking the US was a secular state.    and responsibility   Something the right lacks.   then Obama must be thrown out.   Uh....no. The facts point to the opposite conclusion.   And I believe he will be.   I don't give a shit what you believe. The facts say otherwise.

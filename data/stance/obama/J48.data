I'm not saying this is definite or anything and I don't want to jinx it, but if New Jersey can elect a  Republican governor , then there is still hope. New Jersey is one of the most liberal/democratic states due to its population density and urban background, but on Tuesday, we elected Chris Christie as the next governor of the state, a Republican. :D  Also, I feel like Obama had so much hype that a lot of Americans are sort of disillusioned. Of course, many still think he's the Messiah, but more and more people who voted for him and supported him are realizing that he's not doing nearly as much as he said he would.

Don't argue beliefs. Argue arguments. When you believe something, you have closed your mind to other points of view. I seem to see you doing that a lot around here. iamdavidh has responded to each of your statements accurately and efficiently, while also citing sources and statistics. You on the other hand have done none of those things. Please respond in a fashion suitable to debate, rather than belching your opinions from an ivory tower.

Christ people, it's only been 8 months. He's begun closing Gitmo. He's begun pulling troops out of Iraq. He's working to stablize the economy  and  reform health care. Contrary to popular opinion, Obama's not God. He can't fix everything just by snapping his fingers.  What positive accomplishments did Bush make in 8 years? Seriously.

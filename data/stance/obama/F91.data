Every thing you said was false. I think I can convince you to be an Obama supporter. The economy is very clearly recovering. I have posted the facts above in previous comments.  Lowest unemployment in 3 years.   Best January for the economy in this century.   Dow at 3 year high.   Nasdaq at 11 year high.   Job growth at 15 year high.   Corporate taxes at 40 year low.   Etc. etc.   Obama 2012!

There's no presidence of overthrowing the Healthcare Bill.  And I'm still trying to figure out why you are against something that will gaurantee  even your  coverage if say you're fired, that will force insurance to spend at least 85% of what you pay into it for healthcare (instead of new yachts etc) and will lower our national debt by half a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.  It is truly senseless. I'm not sure how many times I can explain this to you.

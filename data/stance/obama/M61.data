I do not think Obama should be president in '12 because he's making all these promises and yet he has not fulfilled any of them! Lots of people who voted for him our now just realizing that maybe his isn't so good after all. The major #1 reason he became president was because most people voted for him because he was going to be the first black president (not being racist). I think could tons of black people who could run for president and do a way better job then Obama is doing.

No, the skit the other night on SnL was really funny and true. You know when SnL is doing a skit on a president there is some true merit to it. Obama's inexperience is starting to show through. He has the entire house and Senate majority and still he has done nothing. Oh I forgot Cash for Clunkers but that was someone else's idea.

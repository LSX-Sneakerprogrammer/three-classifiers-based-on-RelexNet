USA producing more oil than ever before  Petroleum Insights    I thought I was going to have to agree that he slipped up, but just out of curiosity I looked at the remarks and he specifically states 2 sentences before your (the place where you blindly copied from's) out of context quote that it's since 2003.  "Now, in the short term, we still need to do everything we can to encourage safe and responsible oil production here at home. In fact, last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. So I want everybody to remember that if people ask -- because sometimes I get letters from constituencies saying, why aren’t we just drilling more here? We’re actually producing more oil here than ever. But the challenge is we’ve only got about 2 to 3 percent of the world’s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil. So we can’t just drill our way out of the problem"   http://www.whitehouse.gov/ the-press-office/2011/05/06/ remarks-president-workers-allison- transmission-headquarters    the more I look into all the crap about Obama, the more I see that there is really little if any substance...

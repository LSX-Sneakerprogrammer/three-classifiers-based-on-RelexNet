I tire of people who scream bloody murder over 'socialism' when neither the president nor anyone else in congress has passed or introduced any legislation which even remotely resembles socialism as it exists in self-described socialist nations. It polemical rhetoric at it's finest. Using people's fears of socialism to mold the political climate is deceptive and grossly misinformed.

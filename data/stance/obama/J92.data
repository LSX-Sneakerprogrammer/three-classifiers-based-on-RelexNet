Try studying what socialism is. To put it simply, Obama is not socialist because socialism requires state ownership and control of businesses, wage control, and control of wealth distribution.   Maybe you should.  Obama  admits that he wants to redistribute wealth.   State ownership and control of businesses:   Government sponsored corporations include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Farmer Mac  Federal Government chartered and owned corporations include Florida Virtual School (Florida), National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), Tennessee Valley Authority, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Millennium Challenge Corporation, St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Corporation for National and Community Service (Americorps), Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Legal Services Corporation, USPS, AMTRAK, many alcohol retail stores of which 19 states have monopolies, Medicare, and Medicaid.  Federal Government acquired corporations include GM, CITIGROUP, AIG and many others.   Wage Control   Not Permanent but Under Nixon and Carter.   Control of wealth distribution   Apparently, you should try reading. How about welfare and social security?

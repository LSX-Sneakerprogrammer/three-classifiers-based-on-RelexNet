Obama is a bad president, but he is not the worst. Sure, he has started an illegal drone war in the Middle East, signed the PATRIOT ACT, and was prepared to pass censorship bills (SOPA/PIPA), but there have been worse presidents. Bush started two illegal wars that put our troops in danger, passed the PATRIOT ACT through Congress, and his presidency was disturbingly similar to Hitler's before Hitler became the FÃ¼hrer of Germany.

Just cuz some guy told Glenn Beck what he wanted to hear doesn't make it so.  It takes the same ignorance to say that the recession of 1920 had nothing to do with the war ending and establishment of the Federal Reserve, etc. as it does to not realize the previous administration's contribution to our current economic predicament.  "On March 4, 1921 President Harding assumed office while the nation was in the midst of a postwar economic decline, known as the Depression of 1920-21. By summer of his first year in office, after a series of actions by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, an economic recovery was underway.  After the recession , starting in 1922, Harding cut taxes. The top marginal rate was reduced annually in four stages from 73% in 1921 to 25% in 1925. Taxes were cut for lower incomes starting in 1923. Despite these policies, the economy entered recession in May 1923 and remained in recession into the next presidency, through July 1924. Thomas E. Woods, however, contends in the Fall 2009 issue of The International Review, that the tax cuts implemented by President Harding ended the Depression of 1920-21 and were responsible for creating a decade-long expansion. In fact, there were three recessions in the 1920s prior to the Great Depression and the rate of recovery was slower than during the Great Depression."

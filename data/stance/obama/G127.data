What economist? Pulling stuff out of your ass again I see. Everybody in my office laughed when Obama said unemployment was going to stall at 8.5% I would like to see what economist said that give me some names. I bet those economist that said that are probably out of work now for being so obviously stupid. All other economist that I listen too the smart ones all have said back in October of 08 that no matter what it was going to 10%. Do you really believe that yourself that when Obama said that you believed it, if so I'm sorry that your so ignorant on the facts.

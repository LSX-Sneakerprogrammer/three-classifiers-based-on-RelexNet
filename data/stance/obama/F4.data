I agree, bush put us in debt for the next 100 years, so we can blame him forever. You republicans are nothing more than a brotherhood of rich racists. You took us from our homeland and made billions of dollars off us and now you keep that money while we starve in the streets. You have kept us down so long we are killing each other because we have no money. It's time for you to give us your money and Obamas going to do it. You republicans are going to fall from grace and us poor Africans are going to take over this country, then you will know how it feels.

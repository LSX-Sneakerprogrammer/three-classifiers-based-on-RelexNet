i'm not sure how anyone can compare this president to the last one and not say Obama is doing a much better job.   Well you can!!!   He's kept up Bush's policies, and only made them worse.   He's put this country into even more debt.  He's spent more than Bush's worse year.  I don't understand how anyone could say he's better than Bush.

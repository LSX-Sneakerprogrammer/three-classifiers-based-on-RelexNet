"Jefferson said..."   Jefferson's opinion isn't especially relevant here. People give too much weight to the opinions of men who died hundreds of years ago. The important question is not "Did Jefferson want a separation between church and state?", but rather " Ought  there be a separation between church and state?" And the answer to that is an emphatic yes, mainly due to the fact that religion is irrational.   "This is because waterboarding is not torture, at least not according to my definition."   I disagree. Most people would disagree with you too. Simulated drowning is going too far.   "Kicked out lobbyists? Examples please?"   Well, when I originally posted that 260 days ago, it looked like he was going to be more aggressive about keeping out lobbyists. He has sinced softened somewhat for practical reasons. Still, he is taking concrete steps to limit their influence:  Link    "Do you mean funding for embryonic stem cell research, aka abortion?"   Yes, obviously that's what I was referring to. And I'm sorry, but equating embryos with babies is just retarded.   "Made information about government more accessible. Examples?"    Link 1    Link 2    "Obama has a very shady past...Davis, Alinsky, Aires, Wright..."   Good Christ. You guys really need to let go of this stupid guilt-by-association shit.  Obama is clearly  far  from a communist. Working as a community organizer does not make one a communist. Knowing a communist when you're a kid does not make you a communist. Having a conversation with Bill Aires at some point in your life does not make you a communist.  The brother of a good friend of mine has been in and out of jail his whole life. I've hung out with the kid, picked him up from prison -- even let him stay at my place. Does that make me a criminal? Does that make me a bad person? Judge the man by his actions.

Ever notice how no one likes some one with brains. Find another Bush and the American people will vote for him. Later, they will cry about what the idiot did and forget they voted for them. American can't last another 4 years without Obama. Bush put in a hole in the side of the Titanic and you want another Republican? Torpedo's away. Misewell finish the job.

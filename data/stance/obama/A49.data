No, if McCain were young and black he never would have been elected to senate in Arizon all those years ago, and so never had the chance to run. Besides you know damn well that a black person cannot win a Republican primary... least you should know that.  And that aside, Obama was elected because he had a better message, and the last republican president sucked. He won by a lot, way more than 17% and you realize black people only make up around 17% of the population right?  The fact is, he was a better candidate, and the reason he won by so much is because so many people came out to vote. That's just a fact. Like with Clinton before, anytime there is a large turn out the democrat wins, because the democratic platform makes more sense and works better and has been shown to work better historically, and when you get the non-politicals excited enough about voting to actually look at issues without political bias they vote democratic.

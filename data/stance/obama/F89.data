Really? Republicans have ruined this country? Are you joking or dumb? Abraham Lincoln is hands down the best president we have ever had (Republican). Ronald Reagan (republican) is in the top 3. Just because someone claims to be Republican, Conservative, Democrat, Liberal, Independent, or Green Party does not mean that that is completely true. This country suffers from a major disease called compromise. There have been "Democratic" presidents who should have called themselves Conservatives and vise versa. We need a Conservative in office that will not compromise to Congress or anyone else. I was watching the news the other day and obamination (obama) was holding a press conference. During this conference he was blaming George W. Bush for the deficit problems when (yes he messed it up) he has made it 10x worse. It really all boils down to the fact that nobody is perfect and Congress is full of a bunch of (Democratic!!) greedy bastards (pardon the language). They really don't care about how this country SHOULD be, they only care about what they can do to increase their bank accounts.

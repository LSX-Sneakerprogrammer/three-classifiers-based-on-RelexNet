Ok, arguments like this are what give anti-Obama people a bad name.   So we know you're not just breathing hot air out of your mouth, can you explain what you mean by "socialist" and "populist"? Do you know what those words mean? Can you cite some instances where he has demonstrated a hatred of freedom or free choice? What about responsibility? No I didn't think so. He may have no idea how to run the country, he may have just ridden a wave of popularity into the office, and he may have the wrong agenda, but calling him a socialist who hates freedom is absolutely ridiculous.  P.S, a populist is one who has the interests of THE PEOPLE at heart. Populism has NO ties to Socialism, do your research and gtfo the internet

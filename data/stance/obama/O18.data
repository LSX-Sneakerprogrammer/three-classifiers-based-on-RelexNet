Well part of the problem was that U.S. Armed forces were cooperating with Pakistani officials, sharing information and so forth. Every time we would get a lead where Osama was hiding by the time we got there the place was empty, somebody had tipped him off. This had happened several times during the Bush Administration. President Obama decided that if we got a lead on Bin Laden's location, we weren't going to share it with Pakistani officials, and what do you know we finally got him. Coincidence?

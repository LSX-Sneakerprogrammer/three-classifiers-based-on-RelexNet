Half of the "facts" I see here are either untrue or not even directly associated with anything Obama has done. The economy hasn't recovered. The sharp decrease in unemployment was due to the number of people who stopped getting unemployment benefits after looking for employment for years. Note: you are only counted as unemployed if you are still actively looking for a job. How did he single-handedly save the U.S. auto industry? The deaths of the 22 Al Queda Heads were the cause of the hard-working men and women in the military. Not sure how he's even indirectly responsible for that. How has he improved relations with other countries? Afghanistan still hates us (probably because we're invading them, but no one wants to talk about that war), Iraq hates us more than ever since we left, as soon as we got out of Iraq, Iran decides to start talking about a possible conflict with the U.S, and Israel is starting to hate us as a direct result from Obama's foreign policy on Israel. He isn't a small spender. Fact: he has spent more money in 3 years than any other president has in 8 (that counts inflation). And just to top it off, he's spent more money on vacations than any other president. I do believe his last Hawaiin vacation costs $4 million, 99.7% of it being taxpayer dollars. Do your research man. He's terrible at his job

“Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.”  U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C., September 9, 2009.   This links to  an article  about federal funding going to Maryland and Pennsylvania's high risk insurance pools.   This requires knowledge of 2 things -   First, an understanding of a property of money - fungibility.  To illuminate: if a woman gets federal money, e.g. a student loan, a pell grant, etc. and puts the money in a bank account and later gets an abortion using funds in that bank account, it does not mean that federal money subsidized the abortion.  Second, what was actually in the bill:   "specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would have to be drawn from that segregated account.  On top of that, the national health care law gives states an opt-out of abortion coverage altogether. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose."    http://www.politifact.com/florida/ statements/2011/mar/17/matt-gaetz/ taxpayer-funded-abortions-federal-healt h-care-bill/

"Just because he cannot pass any new laws does not mean he cannot enforce the ones that are already on the book."  Must of these laws that you want him to enforce are bull shit. When he tries to make laws that will be better, the Republicans block any sort of progress.  "He did, that's why it is on my list of ways Obama = Bush."  Let me restate that in actuality Bush's response was worse then Obama's, Bush was told by the Govenor of Louisana as well as the Mayor of New Orleans that the leevees would not hold prior to Katrina but did nothing, it hit New Orleans on Monday and Bush overflew the devastated area on Air Force One as he traveled from Texas back to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday and wasn't briefed about the situation until he arrived at the Gulf Coast on Friday. Thats a week of doing nothing even though he had already been told prior to Katrina that the leevees would not hold.  The oil spill that is occuring right now however was not predicted and Obama was told by BP that it was not a serious problem and wasn't told that the leak was in fact serious until almost a week later.  Bottom Line: Obama didn't know, Bush didn't even care.  "Actually, Bush was the one who passed the first bail outs and in 2003 he tried to regulate Fanny and Freddie but the Democrats blocked him."  The recession started around December of 2007 so Bush's bail outs didn't do shit. As for the Democrats blocking Bush from Fanny and Freddie, the Republicans are doing the same thing now with Wall Street.

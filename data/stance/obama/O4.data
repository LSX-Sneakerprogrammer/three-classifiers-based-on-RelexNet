The inevitable demise of the economy was near under the false pretenses of the success of the housing bubble, which was created by the expansion of credit by the Federal Reserve and the Community Reinvestment Act passed by Congress.    I'm not sure how this addresses anything I just said. In fact I'm fairly certain it doesn't; The cause of the 'economic demise' was never in question, but you did just completely side-step my contention. The president drafted up a bill, to improve the employment rate and to provide jobs, congressional Republicans voted that bill down, and yet they continue to use in their rhetoric the fact unemployment is still high as reasons we should disapprove of the President.  Point being you can't blame someone for high unemployment when you personally prevented them from solving the problem, without being the world's biggest hypocrite.   To suggest that the auto industry was on the verge of collapse is a hypothetical   No it's not, it was a mathematical equation. GM had been in continuous decline for over a decade. It was 17 months from bankruptcy and a 46% chance of defaulting within the next 5 years. GM already filed for chapter 11, and was selling off most of it's assets. To deny this is the utmost absurdity.  The Math is here:   http://www.exceluser.com/tools/zscore.htm   Bankruptcy here:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization    bankruptcy is vital to capitalism because it disposes of waste.   Yeah, and that waste was millions of employees, without whom would have meant unprecedented levels of unemployment not seen since the great depression, which would have taken almost a decade or more to recover from.   GM didn't pay off the loan. They merely shifted money from the escrow account to the loan.       In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J. White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding.  "To me, money is fungible," he said. ''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support. The escrow was not a new government loan to pay back the old loan.  "It's a genuine paying back," White said. "It does reduce the federal government's involvement." Still, he said, "it sure doesn't wipe clean the slate" with the U.S. government.

Which is still a good sign.   All of which were created by bad government policy before.   Yeah, like the irresponsible deregulation of the housing and banking markets. When you repeal laws that prevent downright criminal business practices, this can have a detrimental effect. I don't share your faith, the private sector can fail, and history is our proof of this. If you allow multi-million dollar businesses to pilfer people of their savings and their homes, that is exactly what they will do and that is exactly what happened in 2008.

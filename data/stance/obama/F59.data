And exacerbated by Obama.   WHAT?! He has ended half of them.   Too much spending by all.   Not really. Bush new spending in 8 years? $5.07 TRILLION Obama total New Spending (projected out for the next 8 years)? $1.44 TRILLION.   ANd of that total, only $430 billion is non-reccesion related.   Too much spending by all.   Not really, again. New healthcare spending under Obama will cost an average of just $19 billion a year (8 year projection).    And exacerbated by Obama.   Wow. DOD budget is DOWN from last year.

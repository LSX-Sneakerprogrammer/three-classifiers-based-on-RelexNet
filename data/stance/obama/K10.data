Bush had several years to fix the economy as well. Did he fix it? Several years like how much? Do you think the economy is something you can fix in 3 or 4 years? If that was the case then we wouldnt have need a president when President Bush could have done it?  Saving the car company prevented many from being unemployed and also prevented a strain on the government providing unemployment benefits to recipients. We need taxpayers money to help maintain the economy of this country. The war in Iraq is not over but atleast the president is making an effort to tend to it. People make it seem as if political and social issues are something you can fix in less time and point their fingers at the President for that. If other people can do it, then they should have run for office as well.  Really? Anyone could appoint Supreme Court Justices? That all political parties and the entire nation did not dispute or challenge? Having a perception that something is far more easier than it looks is just a myth not reality in a world like the one we are living in today.

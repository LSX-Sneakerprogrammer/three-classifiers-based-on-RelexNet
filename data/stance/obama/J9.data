Well in your initial argument it certainly seems as though you are attacking economists in general. Perhaps you could try being more clear in the future.   All US economists are conservative ideologues...   You misuse the term "conservative" to mean "believer in free markets". This is misleading because liberals also believe in free markets. It's only a question of the degree of government oversight that should exist. You won't find many purists at either end of the spectrum.   Finally, the track record of the consensus opinion of economists is so poor...the track records of the maverick economists are more in-tune with reality though.   Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Thus far you have presented none.  Yes, it's clear that most economists fucked up in the case of the current recession. How many times do we have to go over this? The future is hard to predict. The best we can do is make educated guesses. We can't predict the weather with 100% certainty, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

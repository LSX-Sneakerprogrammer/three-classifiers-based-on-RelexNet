"his economic views are risky at least"   Risks need to be taken in these economically turbulent times.   "he would simply bring civil unrest to the country"   Simply? How do you know that? It seems likley (to me at least) he'd be more a unifying force, I'd say there are almost as many Democrats willing to vote for him as there are republicans.   "with the amount of change he would bring"   Ya, cause nobody wants change.   "he's something new and refreshing to politics,"   There's actually nothing new about most of his policies.   "but that doesn't mean he's the best choice overall."   Well, he's the best chioce for the rest of the world, that's for dam sure.

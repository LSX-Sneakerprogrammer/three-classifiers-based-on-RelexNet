I think this is be answered in the simplest of fashions. He will be re-elected but it is the reason for that bothers me. It is not about what he has done or not done. In 2012, it is about how the Republican Party has acted so poorly over the last year most recently and continually with the budget then add in the total lack of viable Republican candidates. Ron Paul is about the only one who has enough to say that it is worth listening to. (whether you agree or not). I am a liberal Republican and looking at this election, the Republican party might as well place a loaded trash bag in a suit and call it a candidate. Sad but true.

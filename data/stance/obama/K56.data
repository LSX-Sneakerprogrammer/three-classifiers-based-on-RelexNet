Have you seen government spending lately? President Obama's 2010 Budget Deficit was $1.3 trillion.  For every dollar the government spends, that is one less dollar in the private economy, which the economy shrinks, which means less wealth is created.   We just entered and exited a great worldwide recession over a period of three years, in which Obama spent almost a trillion in economic stimulus.  Plus, we were in war, which is always expensive.  One other thing, prove for me that governments cannot create wealth.   If you are not an liberal and vehemently support Obama, why are you seeking an dispute of my response?  If so, then what percentage roughly do you agree with ?him   I agree (more or less) with the healthcare reforms, his overturning of policies involving Embryonic Stem Cells, the "Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act", "Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010" and his ending of the War in Iraq. I am ambivalent about his economic policies but I do not believe a Republican President would have done much different, because only Libertarians support doing nothing as massive businesses go bankrupt and take their employees and investors with them.  His diplomacy might be a step in the right direction, I do not know however. It seems to me that a majority of these Islamic States would want to work with us in eliminating terrorism since they are have their own share of sectarian bombings, but the religious mindset is an odd one.   What you pointed out are failures of government policy. 9/11=Bad Intelligence, Katrina=Bad Emergency Response, Iraq=Warmongering; Guantanamo Bay=Government doesn't torture unless given authority, The 2007 Financial Crisis=Actually 2008, Bad Housing Policy and Monetary Policy, Patriot Act=Big Brother doing its thing.   Not all of these were related to Bush however.   Hardly!!    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul/ Newsletters_sandbox#Ron_Paul_newsletter_                                        controversy    How about some new blood that understands the issues of today? We don't need fossils screwing up progress due to their old prejudices.

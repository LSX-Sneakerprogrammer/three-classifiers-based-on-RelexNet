Obama more indecisive. He said that he had a plan for Afghanistan in June 2009 then in Sept 2009 he says that the next 12 months in Afghanistan are critical so he waits 3 more months to announce to the nation what his plan is going to be. So he just took 3 months out of him saying that Afghanistan the next 12 months is critical, what kind of leader is that?  Where is the leadership? I have serious voters remorse.

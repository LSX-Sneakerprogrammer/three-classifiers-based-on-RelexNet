I wouldnt necessarily say that Obama isnt exactly trying his hardest or not doing anything at all, I just personally dont believe that the direction that hes taking is a very good one or beneficial one. He has more or less driven himself into a hole of favor debt, one that he pays back in biased legislature, and hes part of the Democratic Political party which is essentially using him, regardless of what he thinks. Under such, I believe that Both a new candidate is required, preferably one from an independent party for some fresh air and far less political agenda, and eventually a massive political overhaul of parties and lobbying. But since were talking about Obama specifically, youve got youre answer. No, its not a good idea. No, we dont have a good candidate replacement, but still no, its not a good idea.

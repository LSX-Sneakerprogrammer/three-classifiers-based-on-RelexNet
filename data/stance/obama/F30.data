Risks need to be taken in these economically turbulent times.   To put it better, I do not agree with his economic views, I think they would be bad for the global economy.   Simply? How do you know that? It seems likley (to me at least) he'd be more a unifying force, I'd say there are almost as many Democrats willing to vote for him as there are republicans.   But people aren't simply defined as Republicans or Democrats. His progressive policies would anger a large number of the huge conservative population in the US. I would be surprised if there was no a reaction should all of his policies be passed.   Ya, cause nobody wants change.   Change for the sake of change though, is that always a good thing? And again, conservatives, they don't.   There's actually nothing new about most of his policies.   There's something new with his ideas being given the voice that he gives them, such strong Libertarian views in mass media, taken seriously. I didn't say he was new in himself, simply what he's doing it new.   Well, he's the best chioce for the rest of the world, that's for dam sure.   I'd agree to that. Obama's doing well enough, I think, but any of the other Republicans would be very bad for the international community as a whole. Paul, I think, would be good.

I have wonderful news for you. YES! It can be shown, and it has! Oh my gosh, I am so happy for you because now you can stop doubting and start believing. Right? Or... or are you going to keep doubting even when it has been shown multiple times in the media and on fact checking websites? Are you going to keep doubting even when the newspaper article announcing his birth was shown? Oh. Oh ok, I just maybe thought you genuinely were curious as to whether he was born here or not. I did not realize you simply believed he wasn't born here just because it's convenient for your position. Ok, makes sense now.

Please. Help save the economy that was already done in October when Pres. Bush and Bernake gave the TARP funds out that is what stabilized the markets by allowing credit to still flow.   Kicked out lobbyists. So you call the billions in Stimulus money that Obama gave to ACORN not lobbyists not to mention the hundreds of other small amounts given out to lobbyists.  Banned torture! that makes my sides split Those poor terrorist which given a chance would like nothing more to kill all Americans.   Electing a judge thats his job to pick one not very hard to that.  We are nowhere close to getting out of Iraq like he promised. His original statement was 18 months. NOT. Any rational person including myself saw that not happening. Although I would like to get out of there.  Bush allowed for stem cell as well. Obama just added more to it.

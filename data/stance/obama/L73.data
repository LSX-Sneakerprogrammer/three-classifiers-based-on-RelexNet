I gave a link that addressed most of those. Here is another one.    http://www.innewstoday.net/ obama-lies-about-every-thing-he-tells- you-check-it-out/    The biggest lie was when he campaigned that he would immediately end the war. He did not do this. He even sent thousands more over there. He said that he would BRING THE TROOPS HOME IMMEDIATELY. This was when he said...."and you can take that to the bank."   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=zn134-KLL7Y   LIE  He sends MORE TROOPS OVER. LIE   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=tk2TXhzEX1g&NR;=1    He lied to get elected..........end the war in 2011? When was he elected?   I mean how can you spin this to mean anything different than what HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO? He lied to America to get votes. He had no intentions of ending the war that HE BASHED BUSH FOR.    http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=XtuIByPe7ic    Then he promised that he would not hire lobbyists. Well didn't take long for him to break that one....as he did it the very next day.   LIE....Government open ???????? No Pork Barrel projects? No more secrecy? LIE    http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=o5t8GdxFYBU    LIES......he never posted it.   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=k9MDUqwyzxk    Open and honest.....oh yea, like his promise that his health care bill would be on Cspan. He met behind closed doors.   Then there was Gitmo.......ear marks.......raising taxes.....etc etc etc

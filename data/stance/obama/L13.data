Well I am a Christian so of course I believe the truth lies in Christ, not the denial of Him. I don't believe there are many truths when it comes to salvation. So I think all other views are wrong, that includes Islam. Everyone discriminates to a certain point. What do you think the answer would be if you asked this same question to a Muslim, especially one living in the Middle East? Do you think you would get tolerance towards Christianity? The two faiths are polar opposites...they both cant be the truth....one has to be wrong. I believe Christ is the Son of God....they do NOT. I do not hate them, God commands me to love even my enemy.

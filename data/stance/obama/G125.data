What has he done specifically for small business except wanting to tax more if you gross more than 250k, there has been not been any incentive for small business to expand? Go ask any small business owner and ask them first hand what Obama has done for small business. "Nothing" If the numbers he gave was a mistake that wasn't very smart vetting process considering that almost everybody new before hand that unemployment was going over 8.5% it was just to sell his pork barrel stimulus which is not job creation once the money is all gone then those jobs are gone. Just like the cash for clunkers it was good when it lasted but automakers saw numbers jump 20% but now it's over there sales are back down 20%. It's not real job creation. We need to praise and reward the private sector that's where the real long job stabilization is. Until the Ideal changes that the real power of the economy is the individual innovation then we are going to be in a hurt economy for a long time.

He was the only one that really ever tried to fix social security. His plan was awesome for Social Security. But like typical government most Libs who scorned it don't like to give money back to the people it belonged too like me or you. His plan would have gone into a Mutual Fund or Annuity and you would have been guaranteed that money at 59.5 years of age unlike right now where we probably wont get it and you have to be 62.  Bush signed into office on of the most aggressive bills for Auto emissions in the history of all Presidents.   Bush did things I don't like but when I hear the media and people like you throwing out stuff like that you have to go deeper than just whats being said.  I agree with you on the firing attorney thing. Bush was not a true conservative that I like. He also signed no child left behind which is a disaster and was to try to bring down Government run schools. His reform on illegals was horrible and so is Obamas.

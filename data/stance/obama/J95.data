Redistribute wealth is socialism, it is not just a characteristic of socialism, it is a major mechanism of socialism.   Redistribution of wealth is a mechanism of all economic systems. Socialism uses government to dictate wages and taxes to prevent excessive wealth, so that everyone may have a higher standard of living instead of just the wealthy.   How does that matter? Despite what you consider as critical utilities, it is still state ownership? Before you implied that there was no state ownership, never been wage control nor wealth redistribution on the based of Obama not being socialist.   It is one of the fundamental pillars of socialism, that government owns the means of production (business).   What is wrong with being excessively wealthy? That is what America is. Pursuing self interest. Anything else is socialism.   Wealth translates to power. The point of democracy is is to give everyone an equal say in political decisions (one person, one vote) but wealth undermines this so that a person may have more than his fair share of influence over politics.   Well, social programs are characteristic of socialism.   But not a singularly defining feature.   Actually that is what government does do. It takes away from those with wealth or produce and gives to those who don't produce anything.   We lived in a society which treated the poor and underprivileged as though it was their own faults. It resulted in short life spans, 16-hour workdays, complete poverty, pollution, and child labour.  The simple answer is that charity and compassion produce a more equal society, and raise the standard of living for all, so that we need not have tens of millions of starving men and women living in filth.

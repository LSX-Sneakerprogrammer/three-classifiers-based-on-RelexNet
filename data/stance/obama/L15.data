Absolutely not. He has not done one thing to help our country get out of our economic woes, he has not displayed ANY leadership throughout the debt ceiling, budget debates, or congressional issues, he ram-rodded through Congress the most partisan piece of legislation this nation has ever seen in ObamaCare while at the same time calling for Republicans to embrace bipartisanship, and is sending more troops to Afghanistan after promising to take them out.   Get him out of there.

Why they are calling this bill health care reform instead of health insurance is reform is confusing when they attack health insurance companies?  The most logical thing for anyone is to drop their policy or if uninsured, remain uninsured, and pay $750/year penalties until you finally get sick, then anyone can buy health insurance since there are no pre-existing conditions. It'll be like avoiding homeowners insurance to save money, then buying some once your house is on fire because the insurance company is forced to sell you the policy.  Sweet, I can be irresponsible and still get health insurance.  THANK YOU, OBAMA!!

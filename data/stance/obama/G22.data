Econ was my sub major and I have a masters in business on college so I do know what I'm talking about. I checked into the 250K it is on gross and on top of the taxes already they pay so that's a hit on small business. Obama is not doing everything to help he is stifling it even more. The whole mess started with Clinton when they opened up the lose lending so that poor people could buy homes in 1993. You use PBS as you mainstay they are government lobbyist. I like going to people who have no affiliation to the government like Peter Schiff. Timothy Geithner is a weasel and a tax Dodger and he is an Obama puppet I don't trust him at all. When you use references use non biased entities that have no Obama connection. I don't watch Glen Beck. Try to act civil on hear calling me names on a debate just makes you look bad. I can talk your ear off if you want to talk about money, bonds, international trade, derivatives and what that all means and why this adiminstration is going to make the dollar lose more value than any other inhistory driving the dollar to nothing. So watch what you say. I have done a lot in my life in regards to business and trading so I understand how things work, obviously your insecurity on your lack of knowledge shines through on your comments. I was being fair with you and by partisan and trying to meet middle ground with you, but instead you through your typical rhetoric around.

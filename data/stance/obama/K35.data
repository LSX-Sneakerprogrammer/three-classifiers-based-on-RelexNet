It's either Obama or a republican. It's a true dilemma that is solved by remembering what a lousy president GW Bush was. We don't need another republican touting trickle down economics (voodoo economics). Although Obama and Bush have more in common than either democrats or republicans want to admit, I'll still pick Obama for the reason that democrats seem to be less destructive than republicans. In general, both dems and reps will screw the working class but the dems at least apologize.

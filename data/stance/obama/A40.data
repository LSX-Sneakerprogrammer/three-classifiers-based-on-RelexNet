Obama was not a good choice. I can only give him credibility when he can guarantee that has sat down and read all 1000+ pages of the health care legislation he is pushing so intently. Only when a politician reaches out to the public divulging every detail of how legislation will work and can then explain in detail how any random citizen's particular situation will be affected, will they gain my respect. Obama has not done this. He has not shown any effort in attempting to do this.  He is no more than a professional politician. He, just like any other politician, was elected by money and has not and will never know what the life of the average US citizen is like. Modern politicians are completely out of touch with the average American and therefore cannot begin to accurately address their needs.  I am not anti-democrat. I do not associate with any party. I choose to ignore the "battles" of "party" politics.  Personally... it makes me sick when the news and media portray the passing of a piece of legislation as a "victory" for one party or the other.  I realize I may have grammar issues above. I don't care.  If I could add a second tag it would be Anti Professional Politician, but for the sake of this debate Anti Obama will do.

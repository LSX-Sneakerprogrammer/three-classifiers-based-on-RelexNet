In short, yes. Compared to losing thousands of jobs, losing billions in personal and corporate tax revenue, and spending billions in welfare to support unemployed workers.   Considering that you are only looking at what is seen and not unseen. However, Ford maybe part of the unseen considering it didn't take a bailout, and it is still in business.  Losing of jobs would have been lost, but if an adjustable and corrective market, these people would have adapted.  As aforementioned, this $14 billion dollars is only estimates done by government, and government lie to fit thier agenda.   So, the real cost of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts demonstrate this.  A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has zero credibility. It pegged likely taxpayer losses in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts at $25 billion. For those with a sense of history, it is worth remembering that the S&L;bailout had a $160 billion price tag. The numbers diverge so far from reality as to be laugh-out-loud funny. Funny, that is, except that the CBO estimate demonstrates a willful disconnect with the actual consequences of federal government actions.  As demonstrated below, the real cost of the bailouts will easily exceed $1.3 trillion. In fact, the real cost is likely to range between $1.3 trillion to $1.6 trillion, and is not unlikely to reach $2.5 trillion.   Our only hope is to (1) accept up front a twenty-percent fall in American living standards for a people living beyond their means for the past twenty-five years on the delusions made possible by fiat money, and (2) simultaneously discipline the creature from Jekyll Island, a.k.a. the Federal Reserve System, not to create new money just to prop up asset-price bubbles. Mises    Ask Ford who didn't even take a bailout if it was worth it (in the story you linked to) to preserve the market and their supplier base, etc.   The CEO of Ford doesn't even understand that his own company one who didn't take the bailout is still in business because of good past decisions.   Then why wouldn't Bush claim the credit? and how was he releasing videos discussing current events?   None of which are actually links to any substantial evidence that he was still live.   and mandate coverage for the sick, increased access to preventative care, help prevent/detect fraud, stop rescissions of insurance when insurance companies find out your sick, etc.   Which is the reasons for double for less coverage, worse outcomes and medical bills that contributed to bankruptcies.   This plan is not a single payer government run plan like medicare - it sets the rules of the road and then lets companies compete   Actually, that is the eventual plan because in order to crowd out business, government first regulates it to death, then the whole economies of scale and natural monopoly come abroad, then government takes over.  By the way, the article didn't work.

If you're implying that Obama won because Americans are idiots when it comes to voting, let's rewind the clock back to 2000, when they were also idiots. And then we can visit 2004, when they did it again.   I do agree insofar as most people don't vote based on policies. They vote on a number of things, including likeability, perceptions, name recognition, gut reactions, but not on policy.   I, on the other hand, am not most people, and I supported him way back in the primaries based on policy.   I think he's doing great, overcoming a few rocky bumps at a time.

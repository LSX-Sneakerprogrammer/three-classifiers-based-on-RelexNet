Let's see,  Saved the auto industry,  Got Osama in 2.5 years after the last republican couldn't in nearly 7,  Jobs and GDP have increased consistently every month he's been president, while they both had decreased every single month just about for nearly 7 years before he was elected.  Plus a president finally brave enough to fix our ridiculous health care system.  Besides, Republicans are too puritan and uneducated at their base to elect anyone who has even a passive chance of beating Obama this time around. You're going end up with a nominee who thinks Adam and Eve ran around with dinosaurs, thinks global warming is a hoax, and won't be able to answer a single substance question unless it's on Fox and they are given the script beforehand.  Republicans really don't have a chance this time, and after the silliness in Wisconsin Dems have a really good chance of taking back the House as well.  It is fun watching your "nominees" jump in and out of the race. Jeez I hope Palin runs, that would be hilarious.

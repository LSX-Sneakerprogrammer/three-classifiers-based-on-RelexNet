anyone who says obama is helping the economy is dead wrong. Just look at all the debt he's accumulated with blatant disregard for the future. Anyone in this column who said he's helped the economy is absolutely ignorant and you should not vote period. He's accumulated about the same debt as bush in half the time.. so unsustainable deficits eventually leads to more quantitative easing and drastic devaluing the worth of the dollars you saved for retirement. What's the point of saving for retirement if the dollars will be worthless when it's time to retire. If you support obama you support being broke. The only change i see are questionable policies and turning the dollars into change faster than any other president. DO NOT be fooled with this helping the common man because in the long term he is doing exactly the opposite faster than any other president. USE YOUR BRAIN. Bush and Obama were both awful and it's time we get a president who actually can spell 'economy.' His budgets were so laughable he should have been impeached and not considered for a second term.. republican democrat i have no preference for either i just want the most efficient policies and it's just about a guarantee no one will be as irresponsible to the long term financial health of this country than obama.

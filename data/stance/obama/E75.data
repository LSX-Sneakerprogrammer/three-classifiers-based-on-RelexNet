The bad thing about health care is that it is completely unpaid for. The CBO has now scored it at over $1 trillion in deficit spending. The few ways they planned to pay for it (reducing doctor fees for example) have mostly been removed already. The ones left are things like taxes for Cadillac plans on businesses. The companies with plans like this are dropping these plans to avoid the taxes, drying up still another form of payment. The few that are holding on to it will raise their prices on products, meaning ultimately it is the consumer who will pay for it. Premiums are already rising to cover the high risk pools. Finally, this takes away your freedom to choose. you are no longer free to chose not to buy health insurance. I have mixed feelings about this, but it certainly isn't something we should have decided lightly, let alone in bribery infested back room deals.  Oh, and finally a lot of this must be paid by the states in a few years, at a time when state budgets are literally falling apart.

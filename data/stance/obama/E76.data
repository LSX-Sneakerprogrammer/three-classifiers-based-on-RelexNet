Its a complex system, it can go alot of ways. I think its best just to see what happens. Theres so many options, I can think of hundreds of ways it could go down. I'm thinking Competition between innovative companies should lead to the best outcome the system can have. Basically I'm saying the market will find a way, and if not we'll have to do something different.    I don't large bills, it makes it easier for small things to be passed that shouldn't. All of government(except like CIA operatives or something) should be transparent, back rooms should be made of glass so to speak. Health reform certainly isn't something to be passed lightly. The process health reform went through could of been, and should of been a lot better.

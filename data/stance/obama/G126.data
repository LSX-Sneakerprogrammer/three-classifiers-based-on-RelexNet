I don't make 250k I wish I did. The 250k is taxed on the gross profit, which from my understanding is before all employees are paid and expenses. I do know several business owners that fall under this category, a company that makes 250k gross after all is paid and done the owner would net about 100k, I was just trying to make the point on how much work it actually takes to make a profit for a business. Like small company I work for they Gross profit make almost 1.2 million a year and the owners take home after all is paid is only 150k. each scenario is different. I'm not totally against I think that they should raise the amount to more. 250k is not a lot when your talking about them taxing you on gross and not net. I could be wrong but this is what I was told.

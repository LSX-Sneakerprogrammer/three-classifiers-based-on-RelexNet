Would you not give him any credit for anything he has done so far? Or are you against him 100%?  Do you feel like his health care bill was a mistake?  Would you not also say that he entered the presidency in an extremely rough time?  In my opinion I say we give him the next four, he is not nearly as bad as the eight years that preceded him. I feel like he is trying to implement change, and do what he set out to do in the beginning of his campaign.  I really see no president that is going to do a better job ( at least that has a chance of getting elected ) than Obama, unless you had someone in mind that had a hope of winning?

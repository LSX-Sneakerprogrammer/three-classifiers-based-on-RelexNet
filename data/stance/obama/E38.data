I think his point is that he was elected SOLELY because he was black. He is, in fact calling people who elected him racist.. The often stated position that "everyone who hates Obama is racist" is a silly ad hominum attack. If anything it shows you, the speaker, to be a racist, as your only evidence of your claim is that he is white and Obama is black. Thus, you are making your decision and judgment based entirely on race.

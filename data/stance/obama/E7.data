I'm not infatuated at all, in fact I think he has been too moderate. But I'm not a retard who lives in an alternate universe where Obama has horns. He's doing a really good job especially considering what he was left with.   It is weird to believe in constitutional govt. If you think they're weird, give us reasons, or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot (someone who makes decisions without facts).   And exactly what part of the constitution has Obama not followed? That is why they are weird, they live under a number of delusions, that the government has been acting unconstitutionally only one of many. Here are some of the other tea party delusions:  1. Obama was not born here  2. Obama is taking your guns when in fact he's relaxed gun laws.  3. Obama has raised their taxes, when in fact everyone paid less taxes last year.  4. Only poor black people who want free stuff voted for him even though he won by one of the largest majorities in history  I'm sure there are more but I try not to talk to the village idiots.  Anyway, yes, on average every one really did pay less taxes. I realize that ruins many of those potato chip stuffed asses reason for leaving their recliner and making a colorful sign, but it is the truth.  Further, half the idiot tea party crying about "Gov'ment tooks my money! WAH!" Actually benefit from one government program or another, and would be crying even harder if the government took away their Medicare or social security.  2. No, spending really has been cut. The stimulus was passed under Bush, and under Obama most of the money has been repaid. It's yet another silly tea bagger delusion, this idea that only Obama passed the stimulus, and that the stimulus isn't the only thing that saved us from another great depression. Every expert says without it we would be living in Hoover tents right now. Anyway,   part of the problem I see, is that people like yourself when I say "spending has been cut" you are comparing spending now, to spending in magical fairy land, while I on the other hand am dealing with reality, and the spending during the Bush years.  3. Uh, no.  Every  country that has a similar plan, and usually an even more liberal plan than what was passed here, spends less per capita on healthcare. That means they have more money. That means they are less likely to have financial meltdowns due to healthcare. Again, you do not argue in reality. Look at any chart of healthcare spending and you will see the US spent nearly twice as much as any country before this was passed.  4. Oh my god, are you literally retarded? I mean I had my suspicions when I saw your name, looks like a gay dating site title, but that aside I didn't really think you were literally retarded until I saw your number 4 point there.   Bush was handed the best economy in the history of the US due to Clinton's policies. This massive surplus was literally squandered by that monkey Bush in about 3 years. Due to what you call "stimulus" which is really just tax cuts for people who don't need them and won't put the money back into the economy and insane deregulation that started with Reagan, we went from the greatest US economy in history to the second worst in US history.  It is truly an accomplishment in itself, how one crappy president with daddy issues can bring an entire economy to it's knees so quickly. Now we have an intelligent person in office, and for the first time in about 6 years each month is showing less job losses than the last, and in some instances actual job gains,  and still you preach Bush era economic strategy. It is truly mind boggling how one can be so completely clueless.  Honestly I'm bored of you now.  I will add though to your "bigot" comment. You do realize that if Obama were not black this fake corporate run grass roots tea bagger bs would not happen. Sure some are just clueless idiots who live in a Faux Noise media alternate Universe and have no idea how backwards their view of what is going on is, but most are pissed because "real America" as they put it, in there view does not include black people. Disliking people because of their opinions is far different than comparing a democratically elected president to Hitler and insisting he was not born here all because of the color of his skin.  And I don't want to hear the old line "no that's not it uh, uh, it's his policies."  Bullshit. Where was the tea party in the Clinton years? Where was the tea party when Bush with the help of that troll Cheyenne destroyed the strongest economy in the world? Nowhere, because Clinton and Bush are white. Bigot indeed.

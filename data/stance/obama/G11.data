First of all, you should really check up on this one. Separation of church and state is not in the constitution. It was first mentioned by Thomas Jefferson in a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association. They were concerned that the government was getting too involved in what the church could say or do. Jefferson said in the letter that there is "A wall of seperation between church and state", however, he said that it was a one way wall, that the state shouldn't get involved in the church. He said nothing of the church not getting involved in the state. So, in effect, "separation of church and state" in the sense that many people think of it, does not exist. Also, your comment about him allowing torture, is unfounded, especially if you are talking about waterboarding. This is because waterboarding is not torture, at least not according to my definition. The definition of torture according to dictionary.com is the act of inflicting excruciating pain, as punishment or revenge, as a means of getting a confession or information, or for sheer cruelty. Waterboarding does not cause "excruciating pain", at least not in my book. Ok, he spent a lot of money, but Obama has already totally surpassed Bush in spending. Also, have you heard of trickledown? It's an economic fact, and if you haven't heard of it you should look it up, because cutting taxes for the rich helps our economy. Why would he reform our financial system? The system is fine, if the government would take it's hands off the system we would get out of this recession much faster. Cutting taxes will also be very helpful in accomplishing that. You say he didn't address global warming. This is an entire debate in itself, but have you ever considered that maybe global warming isn't caused by greenhouse gases? That maybe it's caused by sunspot activity on the big ball of fire in the sky? You say he didn't address the rising income inequality in America. Sounds to me like a principle of communism. You say he failed to fix Social Security. How was he going to "fix" social security? The system is obviously broke, but he wouldn't have had the support of congress to do so. Also, it wouldn't have been a problem in the first place if good old FDR hadn't started it and all the massive government spending in the first place.   Now, lets compare him to Obama (assuming everything you have said is true):  He completely blundered with regard to Katrina, Obama completely blundered with regard to the BP oil spill.  He soured our relations with the rest of the world, Obama made it 10x worse by going on a global apology tour.  He fired United States Attorneys for political reasons, Obama has put socialist and communist friends into positions in the   white house (Cass Sunstein, John Holdrin, Van Jones, to name a few)  He didn't reform our financial system, Obama wants to "Fundementally transform the United States of America" in his own words.  He didn't address global warming, Obama wants Cap and Trade to fine companies for not being "green" enough.  He didn't commit enough to Afghanistan, Obama won't commit to anywhere or anything.  He didn't address health care costs, Obama wants to institute a socialist healthcare system.  He failed to fix Social Security, Obama: ditto.  He never got Bin Laden, neither did Obama.  Now I'm not the biggest fan of Bush either, but he was an ok president. Obama is simply messing up the U.S. and rapidly taking America down a path that the American people don't want to go.

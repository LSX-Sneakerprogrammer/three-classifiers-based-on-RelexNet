I'm not really sure why those on the right don't love the man, his arrogance and condescending attitude will lead to the Republicans having huge gains in November... and the funny thing is that Obama is really not much different then the Republicans that hate him. Sure, he got his health care bill passed, but other then that what has he done that was so different then Bush?   War in the Middle East?  He is pulling the troops out of Iraq, but only to have increased activity in Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, and soon to be Iran.   Patriot Act?  Check, still there and growing strong.   Turning his back to those accused of being terrorists?"  Check, adios to Miranda Rights.    Jumping through obstacles and use of bullying to get unpopular legislation passed?  Check. Though the Republicans have not exactly been helpful.    Allowing Wall Street to do whatever the fuck they want?  Check. This one falls more on Congress, but seeing as he has a huge majority he does not have much of an excuse.   Allowing the Federal Reserve to do whatever the fuck they want?  Check. He's not even sorry about this one.   Allowing big banks to do whatever the fuck they want?  Check, this one may see some action though.   Allowing giant corporations deemed "too big to fail" do whatever the fuck they want?  Check.    Watch as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae fail?  Check, only a matter of time before they get a bailout.   Bailout failing entities?  Check. This time we have gone from bailing out banks to bailing out countries.    Backroom deals hidden from the public?  Check.   Criticize the public for the same mistakes that he commits?"  Check, telling people to be tolerant of different views in the media while declaring the Tea Party Movement to be "Teabaggers" does not send the best message.    Holding a party while states are experiencing extreme natural disasters?"  Check, but at least he was able to get some good stand up comedy done.    Offshore drilling?"  Check, he might want to rethink this compromise over.    Go against gay marriage?"  Che... never mind, he was never for it.   Have no sense of fiscal responsibility?  I'm not not sure if I should even count this one because was there even any hope of this happening?    Continue war on drugs?  Check, but I'll give him credit for some innovation when it comes to fighting the war.    Pretend to be for safe boarders while at the same time doing nothing to protect them?  Check.    Promote environmentalism while at the same time failing to get some real legislation done?  Check, I'm aware that Cap and Trade is still technically alive, but seeing as it is pretty much dead and watered down I think it might be safe to consider this a failure.      Granted, some of these points might be a bit weak and I'm well aware that he has been able to get some leftest bills passed that have not gotten much coverage. But honestly, will the rest of his term really matter? It's become rather clear that the majorities that the Dems hold in Congress are going to be widdled down if not flat out erased come November, so any major legislation that he wants to get passed will have to be done right now. He has Congress busy with the Wall Street "reform" bill, but that thing is getting wattered down to the point where it is looking more like a PR stunt rather than actual legislation.   There is always the possibility of Obama becoming more pragmatic with the Republicans during the second half of his term like Clinton was in the 90's, but what's the point? They have already shown that they would rather see him fail in order for their own political gain instead of attempting bipartisanship.

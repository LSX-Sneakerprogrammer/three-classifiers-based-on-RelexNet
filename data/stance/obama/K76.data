what you need to realize is that this president is flawed by his actions, by his political stance, and his lack of control on our country. trying to prove a point by saying something comepletely unrelated to the preformance of him as a president makes you look like a political moron. Congradulations for making this horrible attempt at an argument and giving the impression to people who see differently think we all are moronic ibaciles who cannot form an actual, prominent, legitament, and reletive argument.

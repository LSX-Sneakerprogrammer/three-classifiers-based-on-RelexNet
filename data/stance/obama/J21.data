Doesn't saying "Economists expect" suggest that they are all in agreement? That is not the case. Not all economists agree with that. There are very successful and reputable economists that say that we have not seen the worst of it yet!  Its not a matter of people finding jobs so much as it is companies hiring those people.   It is my opinion that the current administrations policies are not favorable for that happening.  I disagree with your assertion that the bail outs were the correct thing to do but that is another debate.   Just my opinion.  Looking forward to your "rational" response. :_)

The Economy sucks still. Unemployment is up. Foreclosure is up. I mean I give Obama credit he has good ideas but they suck if not putting them to action.    When Obama took office we were losing on average 700,000 jobs per month. Now we've leveled off gaining some and losing some month to month. The reason Obama has not done as much as he wanted is because since he took office Republicans have raped the filibuster rule. Prior to Obama being president the most any party had used the filibuster in the history of the Senate in one year was around a hundred. Last year Republicans filibustered over 200 times. That is the only reason he hasn't had as much as he would like done. That's not his fault.  And every president since Nixon except Bush Jr has wanted to pass a healthcare bill. Every single one. Obama has been the only President able to, and that in itself is going to put him on par with some great presidents. And once this psychotic tea party pout fest ends and republicans come to their senses and start compromising on things, he'll be able to bring the economy the rest of the way back as well.  Of course though in 6 years Republicans will just elect another frat boy or actor to ruin all the hard democratic work again &gt;&lt;

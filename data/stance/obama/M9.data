No, that check is coming almost entirely under the 8k new home buyers credit I'm earning for buying my house last year... which was passed by... hmmm, who was that guy again? Tall fellow. Dark skin. Currently lives in a large white house out east somewhere...   Bush's "tax cuts" do next to squat for me.   Nice try though.

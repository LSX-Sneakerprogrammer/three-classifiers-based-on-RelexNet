I don't vote, but I would probably support Obama in 2012. Unless a better candidate comes up, and looking at the republican party history the last decade or so, it doesn't fill me with confidence.  Besides, Obama makes the crazies scream and cry, and nothing gives me a greater smile than reading the comments of nutjobs who think Jesus is coming soon because Obama is the antichrist, and their dismay at insurance reform.

expanding Medicaid eligibility from 100% of poverty to 133% of poverty (which is still under $30,000 for a family of 4) makes him a socialist? - that's really the big deal??  does requiring "private" insurance make him a capitalist?  is George W a socialist for Medicare Part D?  The problem seems to be that most Americans are socialists but don't want to admit it. We had life without Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Welfare, etc. and we said - Hey, this sucks - we passed laws creating them - and they are still very popular, yet we somehow think it is a prima facia insult to call something socialist.

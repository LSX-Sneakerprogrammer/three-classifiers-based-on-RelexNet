Yes, Joe. A blogger claims that he faked Obama's birth certificate, and we all know how reliable bloggers are, yes? I also have some seafloor I would like to sell you. The video then goes on to claim that the birth certificate must be false because it doesn't have a crease, and yet clearly I have already posted a link to the certification which does in fact contain a crease, here it is again if you missed it:   http://www.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/ birth_certificate_6.jpg    Your video, also ignores the newspaper announcement.   Furthermore, the Kenyan Birth certificate that it shows on the video....  IS A KNOWN FORGERY  Source:  http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/ birthers/kenyacert.asp    ...but I suppose proof has little affect on ardent denial.

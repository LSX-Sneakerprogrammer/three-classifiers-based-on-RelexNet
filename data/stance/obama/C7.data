Obama is doing everything SOOOOOO slow. He promised all this stuff and he only did 1/3... And since the all mighty Republicans have taken over the house, no major bills will be signed. The will not fulfill his promises and therefore he will not get re-elected... He is getting close to being as bad as Busch...

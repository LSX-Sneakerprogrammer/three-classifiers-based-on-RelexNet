Explain to me why it is obvious.   It was obvious because 1) That's the way the term is most often used in US political discussions 2) Conservatives have made it clear that they will object to anything and everything Obama does or attempts to do. It therefore follows that they will call his policies disastrous regardless of reality. 3) Conservatives are obviously not  always  entirely irrational. The italics hinted that I was half-joking, that I was taking a dig at the opposition.   I could submit thirty failed predictions of thirty economists of the past ten years.   This statements reflects a lack of understanding of the fallability of  anecdotal evidence . You can't just go outside and pick out thirty white stones and thereby assert that all stones are white. However, a random sampling of essays in a major economics journal might do the trick.   However, you would then argue that...   Again you assume nefarious motives on my part. This reflects your bias toward paranoid thinking. When are you gonna learn that I'm just a humble seeker of truth?   there is not one iota of reason contained within any of your auments which would justify your blind-trust of the consensus opinion of economists.   How about having a basic faith in humanity? It is not unreasonable to assume that people are generally honest enough to be trusted.    there has been an uninterrupted progression of the transfer of wealth from the lower classes to the upper class...   You really should offer citations when making claims of fact like this. Also, I think you are being a bit hasty in this assertion. But I will agree with you that this seems to be the trend.   Now, explain to me why most mainstream economists are not advising anything other than more of the same?   They are not. There are a number of policy suggestions out there.  (example)  Now admittedly, it's rare to hear a mainstream economist call for some radical shift in the way our economy is run. But radical changes are dangerous, incremental change is generally preferable whenever possible. How would you remake our economy? I myself see no easy answers here.   "transfer of your wealth...economists are effecting policy for that very purpose.   One glaring problem with this assessment:   "Median annual wage and salary earnings of economists were $77,010 in May 2006."    http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm   Seems to me economists aren't the beneficiaries of this transfer of wealth.

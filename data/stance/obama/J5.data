You're calling me paranoid? I don't think anybody's out to get me. Last I checked that's the opposite of paranoid.  I don't really understand your contempt for economists (or rather,  economists ). Are you saying members of the profession are universally untrustworthy and majorly biased? Let me guess: The only person who  really gets it  is you. Could you be more of a stereotypical nutjob?  Anyway, the implications of your questions are mostly bogus. Economists do at times predict recessions. They don't always call for stimulus. They are not always optimistic. I could address the rest of your questions, but frankly I feel like I'm wasting my time talking to you.  With your questions you repeatedly ask why predictions about the future aren't always accurate, as if the answer to that question isn't completely obvious -- no one can predict the future, we can only make educated guesses.  Here, since you know everything, how about offering a few projections: What's unemployment going to be at the end of 2010? What's GDP going to be? I personally am no where near arrogant enough to think I can answer those questions. I'd much prefer to leave them to those who have dedicated their lives to studying them.

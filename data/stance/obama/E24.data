This is really well written. The problem with Obama is that he's also a bad liberal. Even the health care bill accomplished almost nothing the democratic party wanted and mostly played into the pocketbooks of the Insurance company, who will now get more business and have an excuse to charge what they want. To be fair, the republicans in Congress have dug in their heels and refuse to do almost anything, but they're only getting away with it because of Obama and the dems in Congress inability to either work together and use their super majority or approach the republicans in a way to make things work.  This was the dems opportunity for a golden age of several years of dem control. Instead, they will probably lose everything in the next two elections.

Yes, Peter Schiff represents the extreme libertarian view. You can read Paul Krugman for the liberal view. Or you could listen to  Ben Bernanke  for a sensible, non-ideological view. I don't know about you, but I'd rather put my trust in dispassionate experts than zealous partisans.  And Keynesian economics is a core part of  mainstream economics . It's not a "problem".

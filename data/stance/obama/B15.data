Good thing that that article said that the entire 'comparing debt' idea was stupid, and that they're all as bad as each other.   That's more like it, recognizing that he's not such a Messiah after all. That's all I wanted.   Of course, but the $700 billion spent on stimulus, increased welfare spending, and decreased tax revenue, it would make a big part of the difference.   Money isn't spent on less taxing. that just means there is less money to spend.  As for stimulus, this does not help those who can't help themselves. this helps keep irresponsible corporations in power.  And increased welfare spending is not the answer, as LBJ and Nixon have shown. Instead, proposals by Bill Clinton, JFK, and Reagan have gotten more people off of government dependence and more independent, as well as leaving room for the private sector to increase wealth for all Americans (as it historically does).   Part of why I have repeatedly claimed that he is simply the best of a bad lot.   If the bad lot doesn't include Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, both for completely ending the turmoil in the Middle East, you'd be right.   43 billion is not a small amount,    Not compared to the debt and massive spending that it's trying to quell    And Bush's deregulation (under Ryan's plan) lead to the market crash and the recession we're still in.   False. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were irresponsible in their rewards to banks that did the wrong thing. Subsidization and inflation encouraged the banks even more to give out money to poor people who can't afford to give it back. The housing market regulators focused more on pushing ideological goals than thinking about what could actually profit the housing market. In fact, the housing market was encouraged, by government regulators, to over-supply and care little for their expenses (after all, they were being subsidized to an atomic level). Bush should have gotten government COMPLETELY out of the housing market. However, this wasn't the case, and folks like  Ron Paul  knew this would happen.   but that doesn't mean it was a good thing overall.   Clearly Bush should have listened to  Ron Paul  instead of the ideologues pushing for bigger government.   necessary and justified.   based on the assertions of Catholic Bishops?  They complain more about the subsidies going to farmers, which is, of course, wrong. However, Obama is not eliminating subsidies, as Ron Paul or Gary Johnson would.

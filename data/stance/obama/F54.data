Keynesian economics is so much better, it is backed by emperical data. Austrian Economics is based solely in theory and assumes that predictions are not possible. Although I agree that both the Reps and Demos voted for the spending, To argue in favor of Austrian economics is like saying that we should stop using the automobile and go back to the horse and buggie - Austrina Economics is such an old way of thinking about econ. The reason why we have financial problems is because most americans dont understand the fundamentals of Kaynesian Economics and because of this we have had economic and tax policies that favor the supply side "trickle down economics" rather than demand side which hasnt really had a good shot since Kaynesian economics became the main stream. Rather than regressing to Austrian Economics we need to try the alternateive to supply side economics in the Keynesian model

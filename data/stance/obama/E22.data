Last time I checked that guy that tried to bomb Times Square was read his Miranda Rights, so that argue is pointless.   They are trying to take those away and Obama has continued the same privacy violations that the Bush administration was accused of.    He has a huge majority but 59 votes isn't enough to pass legislation, you need 60 votes to have a true "majority," and true, the Republicans aren't being very helpful, in fact, their no help at all.   Just because he cannot pass any new laws does not mean he cannot enforce the ones that are already on the book. These new regulations that he wants passed in the name of market security is just some bull shit excuse to get more power, if he wants to prevent another collapse then he needs to spend more time enforcing already existing laws rather than dream up new ones.   Because Bush didn't do the exact same thing with Katrina right?   He did, that's why it is on my list of ways Obama = Bush.   Atleast he's trying to fix the economy, all Bush did was sit around and let it collapse.   Actually, Bush was the one who passed the first bail outs and in 2003 he tried to regulate Fanny and Freddie but the Democrats blocked him.

No, I claim over and over that Republican representatives dress the policies of greedy oil and insurance overloads in populist talking points like "global warming is made up", "drill baby drill", and "oversite is socialism" and trick silly bastards like yourself into voting one step closer to the caste system of have and have nots which is the ultimate inescapable conclusion of any purely capitalist society. Unfortunately it is harder to explain. Yahoos only understand bumper sticker talk - hence Palin is the front runner in GOP polling right now.

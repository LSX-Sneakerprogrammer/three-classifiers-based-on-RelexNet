For all the Lefties out there, yes President Bush was NOT the ideal president he was very far from it, I will be the first to admit that.   Then you must also admit republican policy is "very far from [ideal]."   The national average when President Bush left office the national price for unleaded gasoline was $1.75 a gallon, today as I write this, the Lowest national price for a gallon of gas is $3.80.   Jesus! How ignorant can you be? The presidency has exactly NO control over the gas prices.  I would suggest reading  this .   Oil prices are a global phenomena . You have no point.   When President Bush left office (not that this is low) the national debt was 8 trillion    $10 trillion. You have already discredited your argument.   today it's 15 trillion $'s and climbing   But why? Why is climbing? It's Obama isn't it. That nazi...always spending money.  Except it isn't Obama's policy. It's Bush's that is driving up the debt.  Almost all of our deficit can be attributed to four main spending binges:  1. Two unsustainable useless wars started, passed, and continued by republicans. It took Obama to end Iraq and create an endgame for Afghanistan pullout.  2. Two unsustainable, deficit exploding tax cuts for the rich. All passed, initiated, pushed, and signed by republicans.  3. An unsustainable social security increase. Take a guess as to who passed it?  4. An unsustainable Medicare Part D expansion, the single largest entitlement increase in United States history, and likely world history. Republicans sure are anti-entitlement small government fiscal conservatives aren't they...  -  But don't take my word for it. Here is  Obama vs. Bush New Spending.   Obama is at a net $350 billion in non-recession spending (projected out for EIGHT years). Bush spent $4 trillion in the same time period.  Now look me in the eyes and call Obama a big spender.    I don't see how that is attractive to lefties but it just seems to be.   Who said liberals find it attractive?!?!?!  Liberals were AGAINST THE WARS!  AGAINST THE BUSH TAX CUTS.  Where have you been living. Why do you think they are calling on revenue increases? To cut the deficit that Bush created from a projected surplus.    The last time our economy was worse than this, it was the great depression.    The effects of trickle-down economics and republican economic policy continues to be felt...sad...  And actually, the last time it was worse than this was Summer of 2009. Since then, under Obama, the economy has recovered significantly.   Incorrect, he gave the order to kill him after 16 hours of "thought" wheather to do it or not   He did much more than that. And i'm damn glad he bought about it. There was a 60% chance that he was there. Defense Secretary Robert Gates (appointed by Bush first I might add) called it one of the gutsiest decisions he has seen made and he doubted other people who have done what Obama did.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates (appointed by Bush first I might add) called it one of the gutsiest decisions he has seen made and he doubted other people who have done what Obama did.   the Navy Seal Team 6 were the men who killed osama in Bush's war.   And this was only possible under Obama's leadership.  And don;t you dare give Bush ANY credit for this. The first shreds of intel that came about his whereabout (that of his courier actually) were found two years before the raid. Obama was president at that time.  Maybe it was Bush's infrastructure? NO. Obama has killed 22 of 30 top Al Qaeda Heads. How many did bush get in 8 years? 4...  Obama has been BY FAR the best commander in chief in modern american history.   Taxes, Conservatives want them low and Liberals want them high.   Wrong. Righties want taxes for working people, the poor and middle class (who have seen income increases of 5% in the past 30 years) to be high and cut taxes for the rich who have seen income increases of 212% in the past 30 years.   Liberals realize this is incredibly unfair and that income inequality is vicious, self-perpetuating cycle that needs to stop.    50% of Americans pay no taxes at all!   That is a lie. Stop being spoon fed republican bullshit lies and propaganda. They pay sales tax. Property tax. Estate tax. Social security/payroll taxes. Etc.   The wealthy pay their fair share   They do not.    Raising taxes is one thing but if the president is going to raise them he needs to raise them on EVERYONE.   When has obama EVER raised taxes?  He cut taxes for small businesses 16 times.  Extended the bush tax cut.  Fought against republicans to extend patrol tax cuts and won.  His jobs plan was over 50% tax cuts.  His stimulus cut taxes for 95% of americans.  He wants to cut corporate taxes from 35% to 28%.  The corporate tax actual rate (average percent paid...about 12%, not the 35% the right whines about) is the lowest in decades under Obama.  -  But no...he wants to raise taxes. You righties will just never stop smearing this president with lies will you? Sickening...   Barack Obama has been a failure   How? In what area? He has been a success. 4 more years!   6x more than President Bush.   HA! That man ruined the country and Obama begins to fix it, but no...he is 6x worse.   If your going to argue this please do so in an intelligent, mature manner.    Something you failed to do...

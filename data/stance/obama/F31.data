Socialism is essentially the principle of amelioration applied to social and political discourse. This doesnt mean pure equitability which characterizes communism, rather, it means to promote a balance between the tendency for stratafication and the ideal of providing for base level provisions - food, shelter, clothing, health.   Evidence suggests that socialism tends to reduce crime. Socialist policies promote education as well, which can only serve to benefit our economic situation insofar as our nation has become a service-based economy, and our remaining industries are both capital intensive and require at least some post secondary degrees (High tech industries).   Insofar as this is true, Obama, who has an idiologically left (socialistic) alignment, is the best option. His efficacy at promoting socialist policies is limited by the right aligned political majority in congress, however, if he were able to promote his ideas our country would benefit over the long run more than it would otherwise.

Good point on that maybe the United Nations should go into Pakistan and demand they disarm their nukes. It's pretty scary scenario when you think about it.   On the other hand I had a real new rule regulation hit me in the face to day. I was trying to surrender and pull my money out of a 403B plan that my wife has and before Jan 1 of this year it would have been no problem but now you can't. The reason when I asked my broker was they had no reason even when the regulators set out the new rules they targeted 403B and their reason according to my broker who is an expert on the markets said they had none. Great! So this is the great regulation we where all waiting for not allowing people to get their own money out. This just happened to me today. There's a lot more to the story but it is so frustrating that I will get even more mad. Basically the new regulation is a form of pure Socialism. My money, won't let me have it. I have to make up some lie just to get it out like I'm sick or something or I have a hardship which I don't but that's besides the point. I don't know if you own a home or business but if you did you would see the huge amount of more taxes you pay just to own a home or business it's stifling. The argument here is that the more taxes and more government regulation the less freedoms we have and less individual drive we have. Today for me was a absolute confirmation on what I believe this admin is trying to do and that is a Socialist society.

No not the ones Obama was getting his information from I would like to know the names of those economist that told him his Stimulus was passed that unemployment would stop at 8.5%. There where many that where seeing a recession in late Oct 07 and myself included. Being in real estate I had a good feeling that there was going to be a bust and i even made my sellers take some offers then that they thought where low but now that look back and see how far down they would have been they are thankful, they would have lost even more. Peter Schiff was one out of many that saw this coming. I Even was selling stock short before the crash on Oct 08 and made out pretty well. I'm not an economist but I have a degree in it and numbers to me make sense I understand what is happening and I can predict with good accuracy of what will lie ahead. If in the next year unemployment the national average gets below 9.5% or lower that would be huge for Obama. I hope for everyones sake that it does.

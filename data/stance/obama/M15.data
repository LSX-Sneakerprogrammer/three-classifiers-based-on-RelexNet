"Some public institutions". I like that. It's suitably vague that you can completely cover your backside. How about we try pinning you down a little bit though.  Medicare? Is that a public institution that counts? Or do you want to tell the entire senior population of the United states they're on thier own for health insurance?  Social Security? How about that one?  Transportation? Do you like interstates and air traffic control?  Regulatory institutions? Should we just let Wall Street do ANYTHING it wants? Because letting them do most of what they wanted has been working out  awesomely ...  And genius, I am not only wilingl to but AM paying for all of my house. If the government wants to give me a tax break for purchasing it I'm not telling them no though. And I have consistently, throughout my entire life, said that tax rates are too low and should be raised. And yes, that includes on me. I have never lobbied any representative to try to lower my taxes because I am a grown-up who knows that we DO actually have to pay for things we ask the government to provide. I make quite enough money to comfortably support myself and also pay my fair share to support the government institutions that keep the nation running and don't need to throw a childish tantrum just because I'm expected to contribute.

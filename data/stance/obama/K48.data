If someone better runs I am completely for it. Obama was only elected due to all the media hype and "young voters" who no nothing about politics to being with. If he was doing all that he could, why is it that they elected a democrat (Obama) but fought back with republicans this past election day? Nope I'm not up for all this Obama care crap. Save it! I think their is bigger fish to fry and more things to worry about than our health care system.

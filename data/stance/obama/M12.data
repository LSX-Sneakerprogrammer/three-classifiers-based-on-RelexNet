Bubble or burst is a term that people use who don't know what they are talking about and heard it on CNN and know nothing about economics.   Economic trough is consequence of a business cycle after there was a peak in expansion. Many areas of the nation experienced double-digit-percent declines in house prices where they peaked to a trough.

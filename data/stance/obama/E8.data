I'm sorry, your facts are almost all completely made up, and it is you, sir who are living in a land of delusions. I would respond to you point by point, but I attempted that and it's clearly not worth the effort. Every word you say is just reiterated talking points from the democratic party. I don't think Bush was all that, he did some terrible things. I think the republicans do some terrible things. I can't believe how blindly you are following not just one party, but one man. Turn off the internet, turn off cnn, start doing some real research and open your mind, you'll find that both political parties and all politicians are corrupt.

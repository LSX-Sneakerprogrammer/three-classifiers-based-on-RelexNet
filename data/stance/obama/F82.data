I do not agree with the majority of his or the Democratic party positions. Not all, but enough that I vote Republican. I would prefer to vote 3rd party if a candidate was viable.  An independent will probably not have a chance at the executive office for 4 more cycles unless they are a wild card.  It's cliche to say this but it's true; voting for a third party or abstaining is throwing your vote away when you have the opportunity to vote for the better of 2 candidates.  It's a losing situation since voting for a third party raises the numbers for next time and encourages more voters to have another option.  Even though I disagree with the President Obama's positions, he really wasn't given a good start. The housing bubble wrecked the economy. War is actually a revenue and employment generator. We really didn't get to see whatever potential he brought to the table.  I feel that he has been given too much support by a select few with too much financial and media influence. You can buy your way into an elected position or have others pay for you.  Lastly, as much as I don't want him to serve a second term, I think that he will most likely win. Mitt Romney has no personality, a large body of voters, the religious right - non-Mormon - has rejected him. And Newt Gingrich is way too controversial.

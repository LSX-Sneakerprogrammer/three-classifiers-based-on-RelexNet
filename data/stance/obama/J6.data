Before I post a refutation of your latest rebuttal, are you willing to admit before hand that it is logically possible to refute your argument? If you are not willing to admit the possibility of seeing your argument reduced to utter non-sense then there is no necessity on my behalf to demonstrate your failure to refute.  When you refuse to recognize your straw-man arguments it suggests to me that you will not recognize a valid refutation of your view.  (Why all the emotion?)

As a human being with the ability to reason, I'm very much against this model.  Qatar is depending greatly on totalitarianism and oil. A simple drop in demand for oil will destroy your country. Under a Free Market, companies will work to meet demand. But with a government that hogs the oil reserves while depending on their supply, they have created little room for free trade. It's either Oil, or you're all screwed.  So really, even that's pretty bad.

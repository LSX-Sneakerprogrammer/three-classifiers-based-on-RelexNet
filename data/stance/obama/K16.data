Ron Paul, because steam-punk dystopian USA would be so much more fun, not really.   I can't vote but oh well XD  Obama has kept many of his promises and working on others:    http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/                                        promises/obameter/    Besides, that, I mean, being the way I am, I would fight for the man who can get the job done without pushing too much to the economic extreme. Obama is the man I know I could trust on that issue. Although we all know the stimulus was too small and that the marginal disutility of labour right now is less than desirable because of shrinking pay checks, which is counter productive in a liquidity trap.  That is my only qualm, that he failed to push through a more ambitious plan to capitalize on the deflation of the dollar and the economic recession to modernize many of America's public works, water, roads and such. Because, really, for the last 20 or so years most haven't been upgraded or anything.  That being what it is, the multiplier effect was much too small to make up the fall in aggregate demand from the collapse.

They may be dependent on petroleum products, but their main export is LNG, not oil. LNG is used in energy production, as well as in some cars, and its demand & price fluctuates much less than oil does. For example, Qatar produces over 95% of UK oil, and demand is only predicted to increase. They've made attempts to diversify their income (they've learnt from Dubai), and have one of the biggest banking sectors in the region, and huge infrastructure plans.  They also allow a free market to a reasonable extent - both Shell and Exxon make billions there, and there is a significant number of foreign companies in the country.  And, could I say that your main justification for no government is simply economic, rather than social?

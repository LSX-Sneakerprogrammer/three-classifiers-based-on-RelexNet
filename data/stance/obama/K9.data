First of all, he has had several years to fix the economy. No real greenhouse bills have been passed, they have accomplished nothing besides increasing spending. Saving the car companies did not prevent anything and he basically just plugged leaking holes in corporations that will never work due to the extreme wages payed to workers. The war in Iraq is not over. Anyone could have appointed two Justices and he really didn't do a good job there creating the biggest controversy in the history of the Supreme Court. He already had his chance, he failed at basically everything he said he would do. You are going to have to do better than that if you want to convince anyone he did a "good job"

Obama is simply the only valid choice between him and the four other Republican candidates. The current front runner for the Republican party (Romney) has changed his mind so many time on such an extreme level, that he cannot be trusted. Even Ron Paul is completely crazy. He wants to get rid of civil rights laws that make segregation illegal. He is entirely for states rights to control just about everything. He wants to get rid of Federal Highways. Newt Gingrich is a complete ass who seems to like corporations than the middle class. Santorum is a Homophobic racist who pretended that he didn't say that the US should support black people, despite video evidence of him saying it. Obama is the only candidate that can be trusted to not screw the country over. I agree that his economic reform plan was not very affective, but until I hear the other four candidates suggest something that could even remotely work better than Obama, I'm going to have to stick with him.

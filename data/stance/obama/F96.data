I don't honestly see how this man could be re-elected. For all the Lefties out there, yes President Bush was NOT the ideal president he was very far from it, I will be the first to admit that. What you must understand is that: The national average when President Bush left office the national price for unleaded gasoline was $1.75 a gallon, today as I write this, the Lowest national price for a gallon of gas is $3.80. When President Bush left office (not that this is low) the national debt was 8 trillion $'s, today it's 15 trillion $'s and climbing, do your math, President Bush created about $1 trillion a year in debt in 8 years , Obama has created $7 trillion in about 4 years, I don't see how that is attractive to lefties but it just seems to be. The last time our economy was worse than this, it was the great depression. Everyone keeps saying that "Obama got osama", Incorrect, he gave the order to kill him after 16 hours of "thought" wheather to do it or not, the Navy Seal Team 6 were the men who killed osama in Bush's war. Taxes, Conservatives want them low and Liberals want them high. Obama wants to raise them on the wealthy, WHY!? 50% of Americans pay no taxes at all! why not even give them a tax! The wealthy pay their fair share, they make up for the 20% who do pay taxes. Raising taxes is one thing but if the president is going to raise them he needs to raise them on EVERYONE. We are all in this together, stop alot of these govt funded (taxpayer funded) programs and grow a set and work for your living so your neighbor doesn't have to! Barack Obama has been a failure as a president 6x more than President Bush. If your going to argue this please do so in an intelligent, mature manner.

i like the fact that he is making the effort but he is fucking up big time.   the bailouts sucked but if it did not happen the economy would be fucked so that was good.   Iraq/ Afghan war????????? what the fuck...........get them out now. didn't he say they would be out by 2012... that is not happening from what it looks like. he fucking sent more troops.  Guantanamo or how ever you spell it????? you said you would close it and yet to happen. why do we want to close it anyway ???   If you think obama is doing a good job just wait till the unemployment checks stop coming. 15plus million Americans are on it and some have been on it for 2 years. the gov cannot keep paying people forever. he spent time on health care and so on and not making jobs!!!!!!!! so when the checks stop coming and the day is sooner than you think!!! millions of people will be calling for his head.  health care....i do believe that the laws and insurance companies were fucking people but when the economy is fucked, we have 2 wars, a dependence on foreign oil, immigration reform and so on you fucking choose to spend 6 months debating on health care and when 51 % of Americans say they don't want it you do it anyway???? wow fucking great move   Henry lewis Gates/ cop argument..... he came out the next day literally calling the cop stupid...but all this before he even heard all the details. obama sided with gates even tho hes a 5'4 pompous little bitch.  same with immigration reform......he said it can lead to racial profiling/ is unconstitutional all before reading he law.....never mind that 70 of AZ citizens approve the law and the wall street journal/ pue institute a very respectable intuition polled and found out more that 60 of Americans favor the AZ law.

I think that no President has managed to complete everything that they have planned in a single term, or even in two terms. Obama has done well for a first term. I think that if we can give someone like Bush two terms to produce such a sh*t storm, it is imperative to give Obama the same amount of time to try to resolve SOME of the issues.

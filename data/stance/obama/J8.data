Ah, so you want to go to the beginning of our correspondence?  Very well!   Yes. Economists expect employment to be back by the end of 2010.   Firstly you didn’t distribute your subject, economists. And in response I rationally supposed that you meant  some  economists. For no man in his right mind would make the error of supposing that all economists agree. Furthermore, I even granted you the supposition that you were referring to the consensus opinion of economists concerning employment of 2010.   Secondly, no question I asked you remotely hints at suggesting that all economists are nit-wits. I repeatedly asked questions that implicated  only some  economists, and never could it be rationally asserted that I implicated  all  economists.   If you disagree, then consider the following example.  Economists expect employment to be back by the end of 2010.  A contrary rebuttal: Not all economists expect employment to be back the end of 2010.  Finally, demonstrate to me how any question I posed in my original post implicated all economists; for you certainly responded as though I had.  Moving on…   You refer to conservative ideologues, and then imply they are not rational people.  All US economists are conservative ideologues. Why? Because all US economists want to conserve the free-market capitalism of the US which they believe to be perfect or near perfect. Yet, most economists supported the abandonment of free market principles for the sake of capitalism as a means to conserve capitalism. So, who is rational, the economists who protected their ideological view, or the economists who supported the reign of free-market principles.   Finally, the track record of the consensus opinion of economists is so poor I can’t believe any person would use the opinion of the same as a premise of an argument. Albeit, the track records of the maverick economists are more in-tune with reality though.    My evidence: Reality! Why? If the track record of economists was as worthy of policy as you assert then the economy of the US would not be so fucked up as it is now. Economic forecasts are intended to preclude the mess that we are currently struggling with.  Shall I drive that point further?  And the reason, I suppose, that my post was up-voted multiple times is because, believe it or not, I spoke of that which they too are witness. And like me, they too have lived long enough to know that an economist predicts so far into the future that most men are not likely to remember the previous forecast of a year ago. Yet, if there are some who do remember, I assure you that the same economists will provide an explanation of why their forecast was wrong.   Shall I continue with the remainder of our correspondence?  (Better to be pissed off than pissed on.)   Oops, I almost forgot!  Don’t ask me (implicitly) to divine the un-employment rate of the US for 2010 as an evidence of why the consensus opinion of economists is wrong!   They were wrong about this year’s rate of un-employment and I have no reason to believe they can foresee next year’s rate.

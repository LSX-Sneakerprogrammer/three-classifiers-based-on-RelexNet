That's more like it, recognizing that he's not such a Messiah after all. That's all I wanted.   Just to make you happy, I don't really like Obama that much, he's failed in a lot of aspects that I thought he'd do better, drones in Pakistan and others, hasn't pushed Republicans far enough to help the economy, and hasn't done shit to stop everything with Iran. I also remember watching a 2008 video of him speaking for ending the war on weed, yet it's only gotten worse, from what I've heard. I just don't like people calling him the devil, because he isn't.   Money isn't spent on less taxing. that just means there is less money to spend.   Debt is created by a deficit. Less taxing means more debt.   And increased welfare spending is not the answer, as LBJ and Nixon have shown. Instead, proposals by Bill Clinton, JFK, and Reagan have gotten more people off of government dependence and more independent, as well as leaving room for the private sector to increase wealth for all Americans (as it historically does).   Increased welfare spending was mandatory, it takes years to change the systems, and as far as I'm aware, it largely falls outside of his mandate (state law, not federal, I'd assume?).   If the bad lot doesn't include Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, both for completely ending the turmoil in the Middle East, you'd be right.   As I've said before, I like this part of them, but disagree with others. If I could mix and match, I could find most of my views in US politicians, I just can't find anyone who has all of them in one.   Not compared to the debt and massive spending that it's trying to quell   Agreed. Regardless, he's making an effort, and being blocked off, for no real reason.   False   Whilst I agree that there was a large extent of government failure after deregulation, were there not deregulation in the first place, there would not have been the opportunity for CBO's, the abuse of the housing market, and the reckless behaviour that you described. You wish to completely deregulate the banks? This seems unwise, bankers operate in their own self interest, not in that of the bank, and not in that of the country. Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common, with people not being held responsible for their actions.   Based on the assertions of Catholic Bishops?   I was simply using them as an example. I have many complaints of Republican behaviour, and I can only imagine that this budget is just more of the same.

Finally someone has some good questions!   Why are troops still in Iraq?   It's a catch 22 really. If we leave the country will descend back into chaos, and most likely back into the hands of a terror reigm. If we stay we continue to spend ourselves into debt as our service men continue to die.   Why was the bailout such a failure?   The same reason band-aids don't heal bullet wounds. The bailout was only slightly lessened the affects of this economic downturn. It doesn't alleviate or address the root of the problem.   Why has this country only gone further in debt?   Because we're spending trillions of dollars on a war with no end in sight, and the housing bubble collapsed along with our domestic automotive industry. Did you know Bush was the only president in history to cut taxes during a time of war? Where were his financial advisers when that decision was made? We're going further into debt because we're spending as much as we ever have and yet we don't have the resources to back up our spending.

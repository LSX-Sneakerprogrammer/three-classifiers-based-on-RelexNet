I would like to preface this by stating you are a moron.  Generally I would not engage in any type of discussion with a complete idiot, but it should at least be pointed out to you (not that your capable of understanding much of anything beyond how and when you are going to get high again) that every country that has a similar healthplan as the one just passed pays less for healthcare, and receives better care. All of them. Every country with a similar plan. Also, we were the  only  industrialized country in the entire world that still had this antequated type of healthcare that was solely run by a for-profit money machine. Health insurance companies have been raping us for years with double digit cost increases for absolutely no reason but that they wanted more money. For that alone Obama is already going to go down in history as a great president - hate to break it to you.  I would also like to point out that fetuses are not babies, and that Jesus was having unprotected sex with a prostitute.  Okay, go get high again, hopefully you forget this site's url.

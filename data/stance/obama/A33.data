I admire James Connolly's bravery on Easter 1916 and his stance on Womens rights. He received education no farther than a middle-schooler so his politics are of course simple-minded.  If I may ask you a question, did you know of James Connolly before you saw my post  "The picture I use is of James Connolly, a man I greatly admire" ?

Obama’s greatest achievement…writing books about guess who? Barack Obama. He is a master manipulator and lied before the election and continues to do that today. He never would come clean about birth certificate until Trump went after him…then all of a sudden one pops up. ???? Was he really born in America?     He consistently lied about the war. In 2008 after the Democratic convention he stated that we had an “absolute obligation” to stay in Iraq that it would be a disservice to all who lost their lives there. ”The failure of the Iraqi state would be a disaster,” he said at a lunch sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “It would dishonor the 900-plus men and women who have already died. . . . It would be a betrayal of the promise that we made to the Iraqi people, and it would be hugely destabilizing from a national security perspective.” Yet he took a different stance while campaigning. He said one of the first things he would do would be to bring all the troops home and end the war. We all know that…that did not happen.  Is he, was he ever a Muslim? Well……he would like you to believe that he was not…but he has given many different answers to this question. Was he a constitutional law professor? He stated that he was and that’s why he knew the law better than Bush. That was a lie however as he was only a senior lecturer.   He can’t give a speech (with or without a teleprompter) and when he does its full of errors. Remember the Kansas tornado tragedy? He stated for the record that over 10,000 people died that an entire town was destroyed. Actually the town was ok and only 12 died.   He can’t figure out whether he is for decriminalizing pot or against it. He says what the audience wants to hear and did that to get votes. In a presidential debate he sided with most the other Demos…said he was against it. BUT later in a speech in Illinois to college students he said the opposite as he did in a debate at Northwestern University.  He lied about his pastor Rev. Wright (uncle to him, who baptized him and Michele and just happens to be godfather to his girls)….he never heard all those anti-white speeches, not a one.   And then there is Tony Rezko…..and Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn….and his staff who are self admitted socialists.     He said he never took a dime from a Washington lobbyist. Lie he did.   http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/ election2008/2008-04-15-obama_N.htm    Then he lied about tax cuts….denies attacking small businesses……all while he was raking in money, political contributions from those associated with Fannie and Freddie.     Tell me what he has ever done for the middle class?     He hates Israel. Gee I wonder why? Maybe because he bowed to a Saudi King, maybe because he studied the Koran when he attended Islamic schools….oh yes that’s right he is Christian.   He sure did not learn history at Harvard. He has no idea how many states there are in the United States where he just happens to be commander in chief.  This video says it all.      http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=HHIUdMVN_V0    Who in their right mind would vote for him?

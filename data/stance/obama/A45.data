The economy hit the trough of it's business cycle, and by suggesting Obama stopped the downward spike has no truth.   Right wingers who claim to be independent like yourself have been doing this for decades. When the economy is bad when it's Regan or Bush in office it's a business cycle, when it's Obama or Carter it's their fault.   Where is your link of proof?

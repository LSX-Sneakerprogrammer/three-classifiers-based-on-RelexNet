People are ridiculous on the right now. It's turned into an Orwelian witch hunt with no basis in reality.  1. Taxes are the main gripe of all those fat pasty Tea Party weirdos. Yet this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration. Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?  2. Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually  shrinking  the size of government.  3. Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it and held that residing government in great esteem in subsequent generations. This will be no different. If nothing else he has already assured his spot in world history as a great American President for this alone despite knee-jerk "there's a monster in your closet" reaction from the perpetually scared right.  4. Due to the stimulus package, the economy is improving. Here is a jobs chart  link  And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.  5. We are leaving Iraq, and we are doing better in Afghanistan since Obama took office now that we are actually concentrating on the terrorists responsible for 911 instead of chasing Cheyene's oil interests.  And here's a list of things Obama has done, some may not agree with everything, but at least he isn't at Camp David or reading to Kindergartners on the tax payer's dime:  1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending  1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices  1.Instituted enforcement for equal pay for women  1.Beginning the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq  1.Families of fallen soldiers have expenses covered to be on hand when the body arrives at Dover AFB  1.Ended media blackout on war casualties;

If nothing else Obama is at least into the job and trying his best.  I happen to think he's doing awsome, even if one disagrees, this hatred cannot possibly be based in reality. It can only be the result of some deep hatred of either liberals or black people or both, or a complete ignorance of the real world.

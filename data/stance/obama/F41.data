yes, Obama should be re -elected. He has really tried to get the economy back on it's feet and really seems to care about the middle class, bringing jobs back to America, and ending the war.   Obama gave a speech this past summer on the war and he mentioned that the war has been costing our country about $10 billion per year and I was floored by that because I think that the money can be used towards better things such as helping students pay off loans, providing jobs for Americans, putting food in people's mouths, helping people get their homes back, etc.    I also can't believe that although so many people voted Obama into office, that so many people such as in the house of representatives and/or senate have vetoed his economic proposals which were clearly created to help "the little guys" like me -poor college educated people. That just don't make sense to me, it looks like they're trying to prove a negative point such as a black guy couldn't cut it as president. While I'm not totally racist there are some people in the house of representatives, senate, and/or running for election. And not everyone who is racist is a member of the KKK, nazi, or skinhead - some of them may smile at your face and speak nice to your face but kick you in the teeth personally or professionally behind your back. And these people running for president, all I hear is "blah, blah, blah" but no one cares about the "real issues" facing American such as: health care for low income people, jobs coming back to America, creating jobs for teachers, bringing discipline back in the classrooms, etc.

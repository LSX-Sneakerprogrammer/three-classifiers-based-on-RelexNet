On an afterthought. I jest about how terrible Bush is, but the truth is, he was in office during a crisis. We laugh and bash him all the time, but he really could have been loads worse than he was. Considering the amount of shit he was receiving, I think he did a good job. His administration did manage to rack up a sweet ass wardebt though.  What he did or didn't do doesn't have an effect on my position on this, though. It's just an afterthought.

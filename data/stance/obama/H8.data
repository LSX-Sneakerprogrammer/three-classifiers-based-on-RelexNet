Exactly! So why did he promise he'd get them out? It doesn't matter how far fetched his promises were, the fact that he couldn't keep them is the problem.   Obama was hoping, perhaps naively, that Iraq would have been stabilized by now and could run without our assistance. From the very beginning up until right now we have always underestimated the sheer determination of the force we are fighting against. Obama believed that we would have made much more progress in the conflict than we have, and we could leave safely.   Then why even waste so much on it? If it cost so much and had only a small effect then wouldn't it have been better without it? Then why is it so hard for Godmaba to cut spending? Why does it seem like he thinks that MORE spending will help the economy?    This is the reason why economics is so confusing for so many people. You CAN help an economy with spending more. Sounds crazy but it is possible. The cost isn't what's important, what's important is:  1) Where is the money going.  2) What is it doing once it gets there.  The idea is this. If the government gives us money, the hope is that we will spend it on goods and services and in return generate revenue, this revenue becomes income. This income is then spent on more goods and services, which will generate more revenue and so forth... So by encouraging people to spend money in exchange for goods and services, Obama was hoping to improve the economy.   The more money changes hands the better the economy will be. So by spending money, we are causing it to change hands.  An increase in spending has two benefits:  -increased economic activity for us  -increased tax revenue for the government.  It's a win-win situation. What often happens is that people get their stimulus check, and then they put it in their savings account where it sits. The money doesn't do the economy any good if it just sits in your bank account. People have to spend their stimulus checks for it to help the economy any. Another thing that happens is people get their stimulus checks they spend their money on some name-brand good and the money goes directly into the bank account of some rich CEO where it can sit for years before it is ever spent again.

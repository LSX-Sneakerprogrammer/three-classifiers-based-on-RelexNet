The claim that he is turning this country into a socialist nation is ridiculous. We have seen what happens when there is barely any regulation at all, so obviously the government has to take some control. Who do you trust more with your money, insurance etc.- the government, whose only interest is the welfare of the American people, or someone whose only interest is profit? Just another ploy by the desperate right wing to taint America's view of a wise and highly competent leader for their own political profit.

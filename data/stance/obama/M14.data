Fred is using bubble and burst as to describe the situation in laymen terms. If he used real economic terms and jargon, most people would be lost.   Quick GO READ A ECONOMICS BOOK!!!!  The only taxes that actually need to be paid are military and police and some public institutions.  So what you are willing to pay for since you are willing to pay for universal health care but not all of your house?  So you are a economist but not just a Nobel Prize winner. Oh

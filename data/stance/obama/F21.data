I don't think we can attribute all of this growth to Obama.   Certainly not. But the record in undeniable. Under Obama, the economy grows. It also shows republican drones have a very weak argument against him.   Tuesday, President Barack Obama argued that while a limited government that preserves free markets "speaks to our rugged individualism" as Americans, such a system "doesn't work" and "has never worked" and that Americans must look to a more activist government that taxes more, spends more and regulates more if they want to preserve the middle class.   Wow. Did you even watch the clip?!?! He was talking about trifle-down economics, and I agree with him 110%. It doesn't work. It has never worked. And also CNS News? What is that? Try a reputable news source next time or you will get crap like this.   I've heard people say governmental jobs, but how many street sweepers can you really hire.   Then you have been lied to. There are FEWER government workers now than when Obama took office.   I've also heard GM created tons of jobs, but I can't see that being too true.   They were literally on the brinks of bankruptcy. They had leveraged too much and had virtually no capital to fund their activities. After the Obama auto-bailouts, they are now the #1 car manufacturer in the world. The American auto-industry is now one of the strongest sectors of our economy, and of any economy. Time had an entire issue dedicated to the amazing post-bailout comeback of the auto-industry.   I can't see that being too true.   I can't help willful ignorance.

(Pardon spelling errors)  How does Obama not know a thing about the economy? As far as i know he promotes progressive taxation, progressive taxation promotes aggregate demand which benefits everyone since this term is synonymous with economic health - see my other post about aggregate demand to know more about what i mean.   Immigration - How could anyone talk about Obama with respect to immigration as though he is an immigrant if he didnt immigrate to this country? Are you really that unaware of the fact that he was born in Hawaii? Do you really think that he would be able to become all the things he has become if he had forged the documents that prove his origins? I feel like the scrutiny would be really extreme prior to his taking office. The notion that he is from another country is at least slightly racist because it is a reflection of his non-anglo-american name and ethnicity which are irrelivant to that fact that he was born in the US.   On gay rights - maybe he doesnt fully support them, but he supports them way more than just about any other option. who is more in support of them than he?   on Middle class taxes - taxes must reflect government spending, insofar as there are bariers to the greater taxation for the wealthy, he is necessarily forced to tax the middle class more if he is to be fiscally responsible. I doubt that he is truly in favor of increasing taxes generally and specifically not in favor of taxing the middle class. but what other option does he have that doesnt increase the national debt?   On Foreign policy - are you arguing that he is pro war? Obama is trying to get us out of the wars we got into under bush II. Given the political (national and global) complexities of our modern world, you cant just withdraw at any arbitrary point once you have engaged in war. Also, as a nation we have a responsibility to ourselves (even though people would argue beyond this point) to prevent nuclear proliferation and instability in regions that supply us with natural resources as well as the threats to them - it is not only in our economic interest, but our national security interest as well. I am not pro war, but i also recognize that the complexities of geopolitical strategy suggests the irrationality of isolationist and immediate-withdrawl policies.   Terrorism - I dont have much to say about TSA and NDAA. as far as i know, these are the way they are because of Bush II. Insofar as Obama is concerned politically, it might be a bad idea to undermine strong counter terrorist innitiatives. Political dance is more than just going with what you want, you have to navigate the will of the masses to promote the best ideas. Obama cant commit political suicide by appealing to the sensabilities of the people when doing so might cause others to question his stance on national security and defense.

That is the problem with Keynesian economics, emperical data. Economics is a subdivision of praxelogy, and human action can't be predicted through mathematical models.  That is ridiculous. That is Austrians economists all predicted the dot.com and housing bubble crash while you Keynesian morons with your empirical data said it was all good.

1. Paying 750 per year is more than the uninsured are putting into the system now, so it is better.  2. The fact is, people without insurance have a 45% higher chance of dying earlier because they don't have insurance. Just about everyone  wants  insurance, again, it is not an issue of "personal freedom" and if you've let the trillion dollar insurance industry trick you into thinking that you've been duped.  3. It's absolutely nothing like your example of homeowners insurance, and I think you know that. As you keep complaining the situation is more like making homeowner insurance mandatory for everyone, thus lowering the cost for everyone, thus if the house does catch on fire your life isn't ruined and you do not become a burden on society.  4. I find the assumption that only the "irresponsible" don't have insurance very offensive. The vast majority of the uninsured work full time jobs but cannot afford it.  5. Only the healthy think their insurance is any good. There is a very high possibility that before this bill was passed, if you were seriously ill your insurance would have found a reason not to cover or to only cover a portion. It happens/ did happen all of the time.  6. The number one cause of bankruptcy is illness. The majority of these people who go bankrupt thought they had good insurance until they got sick. This is a huge burden on our economy, and now it won't be.  7. Again, like I've explained to Joe a hundred times, the only way  your  insurance is going to change if you are already insured is it will be less expensive, you will get rebates if 85% of the money you pay hasn't been used for health reasons, and your insurance won't be allowed to look for ways to not cover you because of "pre-existing" conditions.  All this fear rhetoric running amok, I haven't seen a single piece of evidence any of it is founded.  In fact, every other country that has some type of Universal care has better healthcare than the US and they pay less for it.  There is no real life example that says otherwise.

When you ask people about the individual components of the bill, they respond positively. When you ask people about the bill as a whole, they respond negatively. This tells us that people do not actually understand the bill, and that their views are the result of manipulation by the insurance industry.   http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/01/ health-care-polls-opinion-gap-or.html    The rest of your points are too stupid to be worth responding to.

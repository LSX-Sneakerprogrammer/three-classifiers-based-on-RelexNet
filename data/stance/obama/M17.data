Now you're just becoming incoherent.  First of all, you do realize that you can't "peak to a trough"?  What the heck does a person being "able" have to do with their ability to afford health insurance? Can I pay for health insurance with my health now?  I'm at a complete loss to figure out what the heck you're talking about on TARP and regulation, I've tried to get through that little paragraph 6 times and cannot make it from beginning to end without getting completely lost. Somehow, from the best I'm able to peice it together... my knowing that it was necessary to spend a lot of money to prevent the fallout of a too-deregulated financial sector exploding on itself means I  like  having too-deregulated financial systems... which therefore contradicts my statement that the financial sector needs to be regulated???  I believe most people's tax rates are too low. .. as for the rest of what you wrote after that... huh?  And unemployed people should save more money. Ummm... ok?     Really, I'm having difficulty extracting any rational line of thought from what you're writing at this point.

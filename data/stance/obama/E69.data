Where Obama demonstrated the hatred in free of choice. Does the new health care bill maybe rings a bell or are you some tree hugging government loving liberal? Yeah, that is what I thought.  Regardless what your liberal feelings of on health care, health care coverage is a free choice, and this bill coercive measures in order to purchase of health care insurance or face fines and penalty, and violates the Commerce Clause of United States Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 3. Not to mention it also violates the Tenth Amendment to United States Constitution.  gtfo the internet is something a high school kid would say. YEAH, good one. A populist is is a type of political-social thought that juxtaposes "the people" against "the elites", and urges social and political system changes. Basically, take from the rich and give to the poor.  As for socialism, it is government ownership of in the production and administration of a organization and the reallocation of resources.  P.S. maybe you should do your research and understand that freedom and responsibility is not just political, but economic.

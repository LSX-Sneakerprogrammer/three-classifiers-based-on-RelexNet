How can that be? This president has clearly proved he knows nothing of the economy or foreign policy for that matter.   What are you talking about?! You said Bush sucked. Reublicans completely supported Bush's policy. So you must also admit that republicans are lying, two-faced, corrupt, hypocritical, freedom-hating, war-mogering, backwards-minded, fact-ignoring piece of shits.   I would suggest reading this.   Reading what?! I gave the facts. You ignored them like a typical right-wing nutcase.   I am willing to accept when I am wrong.   Bullshit.   Don't EVER call Iraq a stupid war   The Iraq war was stupid.   if you think going to search and destroy osama bin laden in Bush's war was stupid well your very undereducated.   1. If you are going to call someone "uneducated," don't make grammatical mistakes in your insult.  2. I wasn't aware of the fact that Osama was found in Iraq...forgive me basing my conclusions on facts and logic, not bullshit like you.   If you can remember Republicans and democrats stood on the capitol with bush in and listened to the star spangled banner in agreement that war was absolutely necessary   Where the fuck do you get your facts?   6 House republicans voted against the war vote.  126 Democrats voted against the vote.   Do the poor create jobs? NO.   You are truly an idiot if you believe trickle-down economics has worked. Where the fuck are the jobs if it worked?! It's not like we just had an unprecedented economic crisis.    Aren't the democrats the ones who want to spend money they don't have?   Nope. That was 100% republican policy, supported by republicans.    So theres 1 liberal thing a republican did   How can it be liberal if it was proposed and passed by a republican and supported by republicans?    incorrect liberals were for the war in 2001   Check the vote again.   Why raise taxes, CUT USELESS SPENDING, for example funding the egyptian military when they we just had to pay 5 million dollars to release American hostages from egypt!?!? the should FUND THEIR OWN DAMN SELVES!  YES the righties wanted taxes for the poor, CAUSE THEY DONT PAY ANY! GENIUS!     Nowhere in your incoherent rambling did you even come close to forming a rational argument.   What was there to think about? was it that hard to give the go ahead to kill osama? If it haden't been for this war you were all against we would have never got him!!!   WTF?!?! There was only a 60% chance that he was there. Do you have any idea what the ramification would have been if he wasn't there? Even Bush-appointed gates called it one of the gutsiest decisions he had seen made.  And what are you smoking?! He was found in PAKISTAN!   I ask you, can you look me in the eyes and tell me obama isn't the biggest screw up next to jimmy carter?   Obama is one of the greatest presidents in modern times. Happy?

War in the Middle East.  so your mad that he's pulling troops out a country that did not attack us (9/11 hijackers weren't from Iraq) and sending more troops to the countries were al-qaeda (you know the one's that attacked us) are based?  Patriot Act  I totally agree with you.  Turning his back to those accused of being terrorists  Last time I checked that guy that tried to bomb Times Square was read his Miranda Rights, so that argue is pointless.  Jumping through obstacles and use of bullying to get unpopular legislation passed  I totally agree with you.  Allowing Wall Street to do whatever the fuck they want.  He has a huge majority but 59 votes isn't enough to pass legislation, you need 60 votes to have a true "majority," and true, the Republicans aren't being very helpful, in fact, their no help at all.  Allowing the Federal Reserve to do whatever they want.  I my personal opinion the Federal Reserve Board should all be shot.  Allowing big banks to do whatever the fuck they want.  They also should be shot. (Again just my personal opinion.)  Allowing giant corporations deemed "too big to fail" to do whatever the fuck they want.  They should have let GM collapsed and that way the auto worker union would have be broken up and jerk off would be getting paid $40+ an hour for putting a damn blot on a car.  Watch as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae fail.  Should also have their board members shot. (my personal opinion.)  Bailout failing entities.  I don't want to sound fucked up but we shouldn't have sent a crap load of money to Haiti when we got our own financial problems to worry about.  Backroom deals hidden from the public.  Has always happened and always will.  Criticize the public for the same mistakes that he commits.  What do you except when the "Teabaggers" are waving signs with him depicted as Hilter on them. He was elected, he did not steal the election. (Unlike Bush, but thats a whole different discussion.)  Holding a party while states are experiencing extreme natural disasters.  Because Bush didn't do the exact same thing with Katrina right?  Offshore drilling.  I totally agree.  Go against gay marriage.  Again, totally agree.  Have no sense of fiscal responsibilty.  Atleast he's trying to fix the economy, all Bush did was sit around and let it collapse.  Continue War on Drug.  Agreed.  Pretend to be for safe border but at the same time doing nothing to protect them.  What is the point of trying to do something about this, the only thing Republicans would support is deporting everyone so there is no point of him trying to debate the immigration topic.  Promoting environmental while at the same time failing to get some real legislation done.  Kind of hard when no Republican is willing to open talks with the Democrats.  In Conclusion, Obama may have his flaws, but he is doing, in my opinion, a way better job then that wacko McCain would have done.

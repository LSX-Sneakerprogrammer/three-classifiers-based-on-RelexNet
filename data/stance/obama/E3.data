Because everyone who disagrees with you must not be involved in reality   No, you can disagree. I'm talking about the ridiculous hatred... as evidenced by the tag "fuck him" and basically every insane tea party.  1. okay so you hate him for taxes he hasn't raised... that makes sense ._.  2. the f-22 program wasn't a kick in the balls at all. It was a billion dollar program for planes the military does not use only kept alive because senators in respective states that made the planes have been too week to support cutting the program. And that the rate of our deficit increase has slowed since Obama took office, and our GDP increased.  3. It will actually bring everyone's cost down, including those who pay for it, including you if you pay for it. Under the current system we pay the most, including you, for the 33rd ranked healthcare in the world. It is a retarded system and had to be changed and Obama has been the only President strong enough to do such.  4. Again, so in spite of the chart I linked clearly showing the job situation has steadily improved since Obama has been in office, you choose to hate him based on some vague future fear fully imagined in your fevered head. And I'm sure you blame Bush's job loss on Clinton, makes perfect sense ._.  5. Wow, that's amazing, don't let other conservatives hear you give him credit for something, they'll lynch or pray for your soul or exorcise you or some other crazy ass thing.  Next section:  This is to point out that he's doing stuff not assoiciated with sacrificing kittens to satan or speaking to Hitler's ghost about ways of turning America into a socialist nation (that doesn't make sense on purpose). And that it is nice to have a president not born into it and who actually has a clue what he's doing.  And since you do agree on some things, I'm not going through point by point unless you have something specific you would like to debate.

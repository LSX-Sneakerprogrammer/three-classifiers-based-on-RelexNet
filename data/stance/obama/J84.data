where i live only the black people like obama and thats because hes black and they dont have any idea why is a good president. if you ask they look stupid for a second then call you racist because apparently they think that we made a judgment about him being black and that has absolutly no bearing on the fact that he has never done anything to help me as an individual and all the other things that are other debates so i cant bring them up at this time

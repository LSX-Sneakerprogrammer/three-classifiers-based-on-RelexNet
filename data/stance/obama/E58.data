I said "it's like" you have OCD. I was describing your conduct, not calling you a name. If I called you a moron for not understanding that... THAT would be name calling.  And no, you very much do not know what socialism is.  And taking as your fallback position the assertion that a politician is a populist is like taking the position that people are air breathing. Find me a single politician in the country who would ever make the following statement:  "I was put here to do what the CEOs of the largest corporations to contribute to my campaign tell me to do! They are my bosses. I will not cater to the special interests of the ordinary man on the street! I am not beholden to their lobby!"  Have fun with that.

No “boots” on the ground Libya   This one is actually true. Although I would have been very surprised if we didn't have clandestine operatives already in the country, which is apparently the case. Yet "boots" is a term that refers to soldiers, from the more archaic phrase "foot soldiers".   If you like the health care plan you have you can keep it   This one is also true. You only pay for the public option if you want it, otherwise you can keep your current healthcare provider, and in fact most people have.

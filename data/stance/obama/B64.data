President Obama is most definitely not the worst. My vote, at least for modern Presidents, is definitely for Bush Jr. He is responsible for setting the U.S. back further than anyone else. Obama inherited many of the deficiencies leftover from the Bush/Cheney debacle. While I wish he would have accomplished more, and not strayed as far from many of his campaign promises, Obama has done a decent job of trying to overcome the adversity of a republican controlled house/senate. If the evangelical right would learn to play nice there would be many more advances made in the effort to have the U.S. progress vs. reverse its global course.

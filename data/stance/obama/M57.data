Well, at least you aren't arguing with a tin foil hat like most opponents, but I still think you're wrong.  1 + 2. Blah, I moved a decimal, you're right. I feel that they cost just as much is as solid a point as the wars costing more, either way it's more wasteful imo.  Plus, again, we won't know for a few years, but every country that has done something similar actually pays less for healthcare, than the US  link  - scroll down to see a chart, you'll be amazed. I think there is something lost in our translation following the money trail, much of that cost isn't an increase, it's a shift into where the money is coming from and how it is tracked. ie, today when one without insurance goes to the emergency room it is not a cost but a debt. A large part of the 1-1.5 trillion  cost  represents that shift. We're paying for emergency room visits now anyway in other words, we just don't count it. Either way we're indebted to China, but that's another issue entirely and I don't believe this will effect that long term one way or another.  3. As a matter of fact, I think a Medicare for all system would be the most cost-effective route. As for incentive to stay in business,  link  - they'll still be the second richest people in the land next to banks even with new regulations.  4. Well, the problem with claiming that it is somehow illegal to mandate purchasing healthcare is that you can use the same logic that you use for "everyone wants a clean hospital." In that "everyone wants to go to the doctor when they are sick." Again, the problem is a lack of imagination on the part of the healthy I think. The fact is, just as many people, when sick, want insurance as want a clean hospital I would argue. If approached as a mandate for private consumption, as in say "it is the law of the land you buy candy" sure, unconstitutional as hell. However, they will take the taxation approach I believe. Like roads, doctors and hospitals are a a privilege afforded all citizens, as such, like roads, paid for by all citizens.  5. Yes, it should be health insurance reform. The left wing absolutely sucks and naming stuff.

"Now he wants to take the troops out of Iraq...But what if they really have nuclear weapons and kill us"  I don't know what year your living in but last time i checked we went to iraq because Bush said there was nukes but guess what, when we got there, there was none and there still aren't any. your whole argument is flawed. why don't you think before you speak.

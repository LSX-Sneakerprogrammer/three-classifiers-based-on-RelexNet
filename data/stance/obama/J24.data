Just like they only expected unemployment or at least the ones on Obama's payroll to hit 8.5% today we hit 10.2% and still going higher. If you ask them where are the new jobs they don't know. He has at least 2.5 years to do something and to have hopes of re-election but juding by the recent races in New Jersey and Virgina his base has made a shift that Obama should have concern about. We shall see! I hope for all of us that things get better.

Do you know anything or do you just go by what you think or hear. It's called a cabinet they make the laws if doesn't even read them if it sounds good he signs it. My niece is a White House journalist i get all of the good stuff straight from the source. Most of what you here on the news and crap Internet media is just crap. Oh you mean the one for GM because they don't know how to cost average a business and let union workers run all over them so they become uncompetitive. Look at Honda, Toyota they don't have unions they build a better car and no bailout. GM is exactly what happens when you have to many entitlements a socialist based business. Eventually you hit a wall and run out of money.

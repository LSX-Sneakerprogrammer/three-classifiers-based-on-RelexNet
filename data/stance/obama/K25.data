For passing a huge stimulus bill that fact checkers agree (check factcheck.org) helped us from going into a depression, as well as the bank bailout and auto industry bailout that, left unaddressed, could have cost the economy even more jobs, I will vote for him again.  For being a leader in the midst of criticism from both sides and having the audacity to believe that millions more Americans deserve health care as opposed to the Republican plan of not giving those millions of Americans health care, I will vote for him again.  For standing up for gay rights and leading the fight against the discriminatory "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy that prevents patriotic Americans from serving their country for something as silly as sexual preference, I will vote for him again.  For negotiating the START treaty and seeing it passed in a bipartisan way, I will vote for him again.  And for the times when his heart was in the right place and he tried to do but could not thanks to Republican and Blue Dog opposition in Congress (a public option, reducing the deficit by not granting tax cuts to the richest Americans, the DREAM act), I will vote for him again.  Electing him again, to me, is a no-brainer, but he can not be as effective until we put people in Congress who agree with his vision.

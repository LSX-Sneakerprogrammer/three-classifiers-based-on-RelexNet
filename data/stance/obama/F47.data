it's pretty easy to understand the more money that eventually needs to be printed to handle this debt/unsustainable deficits of which is spiraling out of control currently will devalue the dollar that is already scarce to the 99% much further than we have already seen. That is not helping the poorer people of this country. The way this president accumulates debt is not acceptable and he needs to go asap or else the best move is to bet against the us dollar if you want a chance at having money/significant wealth for retirement.

God I love idiots sometimes.  The wars that Bush started cost about 3  trillion  dollars alone. This money was essentially wasted, in terms of the American economy. He also threw away hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts (mainly for the rich), as well as deregulating the banks, causing them to rapidly spiral their risks, into what we now call 'a great big fucking recession'. Considering that he started off with a budget surplus, I hardly consider this a good record.  Then, you look at Obama. He's cut back on military spending, partially through removing troops from around the world (saving lives), as well as through straight cuts. In his first year, spending fell - overall spending growth in 4 years is lower than the inflation rate (0.4%). Obama is spending essentially the same amount as Bush did at the end of his presidency. However, due to a fucked economy, tax revenues have fallen massively, and government non-discretionary spending has risen (due to increased welfare payments).  So no, that's patently wrong. Please learn a little more before spittling off indoctrinated bullshit.

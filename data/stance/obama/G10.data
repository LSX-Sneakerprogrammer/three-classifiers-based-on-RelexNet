Bush failed to fix SS and wanted to guarantee that you will have it when you are old by turning it into a 401k and you could invest it like it's your own money, which it is your money becuase you pay for it out of your check. He was the only one that actually tried to fix the cause of it, instead of treating the symptom only for them to return again when it needs more money becuase it is already broke. The Dem's in congress didn't like this because it would mean that the money that is taken out of your check for SS would actually go to you. The system is broke and there is no money in the SS fund to pay for SS right now, they are borrowing it in order to pay for it. So who knows by the time you and I retire if we will ever see that money. Bush at least tried to make it so that it would be yours no matter what happened in the future. I think Bush was an idiot but this was one thing that he tried to fix for the better that would have worked.

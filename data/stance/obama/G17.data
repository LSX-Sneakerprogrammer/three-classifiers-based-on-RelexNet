Helped save the economy? That's very broad, be more specific.  Banned torture? Waterboarding is not torture, it's not even close.  Kicked out lobbyists? Examples please? The top visitor to the white house during Obama's term so far: Andy Stern, now former president of SEIU, an ultra-liberal union. Obama has brought with him a host of socialist and communist friends (example: Obama's "czars").   Allowed funding for stem cell research. Do you mean funding for embryonic stem cell research, aka abortion? Because we have already been studying stem cells for quite a while.  Made information about government more accessible. Examples? Obama has a very shady past, and so far the government has done everything it can to cover it up. Examples: Obama's childhood mentor, Frank Marshall Davis, was a communist. The name of the man is Obama used to teach the ideas of Saul Alinsky in school. Saul Alinsky is a radical communist who wrote "Rules for Radicals". Obama also has ties to Bill Aires and Reverend Wright, both of which are at this point well known.

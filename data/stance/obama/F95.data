O I forgot the American people govern how many food stamp programs there are...wrong! all the govts doing   Oh wait...that is an example of Bush's policy. Do try harder next time...   they can't because obama and the epa etc regulate the piss out of any entrepreneur that shows their face in this administration.   Unsubstantiated assertion...   Doubled? Really? No. They have improved but they were at their lowest when obama was in office also.   It is clear you have no idea how financial crises work. Things go down. Then they go up (typically). A monkey could understand that concept. They are at their highest point in a decade under Obama.   If you want to be technical no its not called downgrading an economy, its called a credit downgrade which responds from the economy to practically yes it is an economic downgrade. (Sorry had a little argument with myself).   Uh...wrong. ONE of three credit agencies downgraded the credit of the united sates government (how good of a candidate they are in investing or loaning money) from AAA to AA+. NOWHERE in their explanation was President Obama mentioned. S&P;cited political intransigence in congress, caused almost entirely by republicans. It has very little to do with our economy.   What role did they play, oh please do tell...? It was their fault for the housing bubble right??   If you are talking about the ratings angencies, then yes. They had a crucial role in fucking up the economy.   let's not blame this on our govt or the "flawless" obama administration   The fu..? Obama took office AFTER the collapse had begun...  What the heck are you smoking?   I don't think you understand the role CRA's played in the financial collapse of the economy.   I claim the same about you.

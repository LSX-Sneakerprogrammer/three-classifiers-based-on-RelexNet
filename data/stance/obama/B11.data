Those two links don't say that he's lying, they say that he's misrepresenting information... which as my second link shows is the case for both knoller and the people who attack Knoller.   Obama is supposed to spend more in a recession   Keynsian economics is not the consensus. Many believe that increased spending is never a good idea, especially under a recession. Letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by Right Wing economists but by even some of the Left-Wing revolutionaries (Occupy Wall Street).   Bush had no real reason to continue the deficit in the way that he should have   Bush had reasons, including the War and humanitarian aid for Africa and India (yeah... people forget about that part for some weird reason). I disagree with Bush's fiscal policies as well as Obama's.    Obama's tried to increase tax on the upper classes, and the corporations, and been blocked by Republicans.   Obama  supports  the Bush tax cuts. He did not try to end them in any way.   it's hardly fair to call him 'the worst president ever'   I already pointed out that that title belongs to Jimmy Carter.   He is currently the best of a bad lot.   Even Romney wishes to use the Ryan plan, which would save AT LEAST 5 trillion dollars. And if Romney were to use Ryan's earlier plans, healthcare would be solved and spending would be moderately decreased even more. However, the Ryan plan is not as good as it SHOULD be.   it is true that Ron Pauls cut the deficit most quickly, and therefore debt, but it did so at the expense of the economy.   It's not just about cutting spending, Ron Paul wishes to eliminate most Federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold. Federal spending and regulation is what got us here in the first place. The War on Drugs, the War on Terror, the Federal Reserve, etc. Obama is just another politician with the same BS that Bush brought us. The idea that people truly believe him to be a candidate of "change" is, at times, frustrating.    The Libertarians look to 'save' the economy, but at the expense of the people who it is supposed to help   How are they hurting the people it "helps." Federal manipulation of the economy has only led us to here. Once again, the problem is big government. We put so much faith into a group of people who think that manipulation and control of free individuals is the answer. It's a hegemony of slavery.

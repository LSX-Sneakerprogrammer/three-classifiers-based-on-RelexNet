Rave, you seem to know about as much about the Healthcare Bill as you do grammar.  This bill will  decrease  the national debt by half a trillion over ten years. It's  good  for the economy.  You see, uninsured people currently only have the option of going to an emergency room when very sick. This bill insures the uninsured, meaning that hospital visit will no longer be taken care of by tax payers. Next, insured people are more likely to see a doctor, which in turn leads to people catching diseases like cancer before they are life-threatening, and before they cost hundreds of thousands to treat. Which again saves money.  Then there is the whole human life thing. We are the only Western nation without some kind of Universal Healthcare, and we have the worst overall healthcare in the western world and we pay the most for that crappy healthcare.  link   You sound very uninformed. Maybe you're young. Try doing some research and don't listen to everything you hear on Faux News or you'll end up a bitter misinformed old man like Joe.

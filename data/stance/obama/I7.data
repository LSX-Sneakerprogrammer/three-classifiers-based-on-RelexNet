Obama, Bush, McCain. They all work for the same people. Presidents are just puppets to wallstreet. People are fooled into thinking Obama works for them when really, he works for the Banks. The Federal Reserve (government bank) isn't really owned by the government, look it up for yourselves. When people get taxed, all that money goes to the Federal Reserve, and since Obama's presidency, over a dozen trillion US dollars have magically disappeared from it. ($12,000,000,000,000) Where did it all go?   http://solari.com/archive/missing_money/

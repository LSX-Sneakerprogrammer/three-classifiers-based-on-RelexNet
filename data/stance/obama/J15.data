You affirm that there are no stones that are white.   No. When I say economists in general can be trusted I'm obviously not referring to  every economist in existence . I'm saying  in general  --  on average  --  for the most part . You already stated that you understood this.  You have affirmed that there are at least a few unscrupulous economists on planet Earth. This is a reasonable claim. You then suggest that we should not rely on the consensus opinion of mainstream economists. This is  not  a reasonable claim. Without a logically sound measurement of the ratio of unscrupulous to scrupulous economists we can draw no conclusions about the trustworthiness of the consensus opinon of the profession as a whole.  To continue beating this analogy to death... there are white stones and there are non-white stones. We can make no sound assertions about the  ratio  of white to non-white stones without some logically sound measurement. Grabbing a bunch of white stones and saying "Just look at 'em!" is called  cherry-picking , and it is not a logically sound measurement.  Further, since we're talking about human beings and not stones, it is reasonable to assume that they are, for the most part, acting in good faith. To suggest that unscrupulous economists outnumber scrupulous economists, or to suggest that the body of unscrupulous economists is sufficiently powerful so as to render untrustworthy the consensus opinion of the profession as a whole... This is an extraordinary claim and as such requires extraordinary evidence... Such as a random sampling of predictions made in a major journal or newspaper.   ...a group of individuals has consistently misled our expectations...   The keyword there is "consistently". You have not demonstrated they  consistently  get things wrong and cannot do so with cherry picked anecdotes.

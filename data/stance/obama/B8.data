I don't deny that Obama isn't amazing (I only support him now as the best of a bad lot), but with the debt, that's hardly the most accurate way of looking at it.  While it is true that the debt has increased under Obama more than anyone else, trillions of that comes from Bush's spending in Iraq/Afghanistan, the payments were delayed so it wouldn't be Bush's problem.  Link   If you look at what the two actually spent, you'll notice a massive difference, and yet people still give Obama responsibility for things that he had no control over. I do not see this as fair in any way.

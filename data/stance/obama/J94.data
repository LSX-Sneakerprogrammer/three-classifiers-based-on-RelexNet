Which is not socialism.   Redistribute wealth is socialism, it is not just a characteristic of socialism, it is a major mechanism of socialism.   Does our state own all businesses and corporations? Or, does it own all critical utilities?   How does that matter? Despite what you consider as critical utilities, it is still state ownership? Before you implied that there was no state ownership, never been wage control nor wealth redistribution on the based of Obama not being socialist.   Not presently.   Really, this is because I wrote not permanent.   Redistribution of wealth entails a whole layer of government that controls incomes and aims to prevent people from becoming excessively wealthy to the detriment of others   What is wrong with being excessively wealthy? That is what America is. Pursuing self interest. Anything else is socialism.   It isn't as simple as having social programs.   Wait... Socialism is similar to social programs...SO  You said, Have you ever heard of the saying (paraphrased) "Two rectangles, one is equilateral, the other is not. Both are rectangles but only one is a square."  Well, social programs are characteristic of socialism.  Therefore, social programs is a characteristic of socialism, like a rectangle is a characteristics of a square, however, it is a major mechanisms of socialism.  Actually that is what government does do. It takes away from those with wealth or produce and gives to those who don't produce anything.

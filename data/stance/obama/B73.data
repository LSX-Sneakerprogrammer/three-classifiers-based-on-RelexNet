I have really only heard one semi-effective argument against Obama.  Mostly, what I hear is that he's Muslim, Kenyan, or Black. Frankly, if he had blond hair and blue eyes, the outcome would look a lot different. When I'm surrounded by just white people and they feel a little more relaxed to use the N-word, that's mostly what I hear.

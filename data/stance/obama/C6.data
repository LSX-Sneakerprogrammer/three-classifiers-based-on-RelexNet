It is lucky that Obama does things slowly, and that he has done little.  It is lucky that he is a mindless puppet. In a democracy, I do not want a ruler who rules with an iron fist, I want a man who listens to the people, and makes wise decisions that allow the USA to continue to be a place of freedom for all.  A man who wants to do lots of things with a country will not be a good ruler. I do not like high taxes, but I do like taxes. I like being able to have roads that are paid for by the state, without tolls.   When I vote in the next election, I will vote for Obama, not because he is the greatest president, but because he is the most sane, of the two choices we are given. Romney does not appear to be fully sane, nor does he seem to have an ounce of altruism within him. I think he will ruin America in a very bad way. Obama will allow America to stabilize and maintain it's velocity in a steady direction, heading towards progress and peace.

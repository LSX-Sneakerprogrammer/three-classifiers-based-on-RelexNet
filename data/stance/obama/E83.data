Please.   The answer is still "no".   You can't pay off a credit card, using a credit card and then claim to be debt free.   Fighting strawmen doesn't make your case.   $6.7 billion out of a total $49.5 billion was given back and then advertised as "GM Pays Entire Loan Back Plus Interest."   The ~$7billion was the loan. The rest was purchased shares, if I remember correctly, and wasn't a loan - but carried an expectation of being bought back by GM or some other investor. They used the escrow funds to repay their outstanding balance. I grant you full justification for complaining about the money going to  any company  to begin with. That's fine. But the money for the actual loan has been paid back with superfluous funds. What would you have them do with the escrow funds, precisely: keep the money, use it to hire some prostitutes and screw them while high on mountains of coke?

Obama was not a good choice. I can only give him credibility when he can guarantee that has sat down and read all 1000+ pages of the health care legislation he is pushing so intently.   He is pushing legislation, which is different from advocating any specific bill. When the representatives finish debating and come to some kind of concession, a bill will be proposed for legislation, voted on and the President  will then  review it, sign on or veto it for another round of debate. It would be pointless for the President to read all of the bills before they are up for legislation.   Only when a politician reaches out to the public divulging every detail of how legislation will work and can then explain in detail how any random citizen's particular situation will be affected, will they gain my respect.   Which is impossible until a bill has been finalized and voted on in the legislative branch. Until then there are no details of "THE bill" to plop out. Obama so far has been doing what he's supposed to be doing: talk about what his agenda is for the bill that is being debated and formed in the legislature, and correcting or clarifying misconceptions about what is being proposed by his administration.

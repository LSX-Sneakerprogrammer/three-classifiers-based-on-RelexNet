All Americans WILL BE were, “surprised, disappointed and angry” about lockerbie bomber  Obama Memo    Here is what the memo said:  “The United States is not prepared to support Megrahi's release on compassionate release or bail.”  “it would be most appropriate for Megrahi to remain imprisoned for the entirety of his sentence”  “Nevertheless, if Scottish authorities come to the conclusion that Megrahi must be released from Scottish custody, the U.S. position is that conditional release on compassionate grounds would be a far preferable alternative to prisoner transfer, which we strongly oppose.”  “any such release should only come after the results of independent and comprehensive medical exams clearly establishing that Megrahi's life expectancy is less than three months. The results of these exams should be made available to the United States and the families of the victims of Pan Am 103”  “the welcoming reception that Megrahi might receive if he is permitted to travel abroad would be extremely inappropriate given Megrahi's conviction for a heinous crime that continues to have a deep and profound impact on so many. As such, compassionate release or bail should be conditioned on Megrahi remaining in Scotland”  “We hope that the Scottish Government would consider every available alternative before considering the granting of Megrahi's prisoner transfer application”   http://www.state. gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/07/145142.htm    Here is what Obama said:  “I think all of us here in the United States were surprised, disappointed, and angry about the release of the Lockerbie bomber. And  my administration expressed very clearly our objections prior to the decision being made  and subsequent to the decision being made.”   http://www.whitehouse.gov/ the-press-office/ remarks-president-obama-and-prime- minister-cameron-united-kingdom-joint- press-avail    There is no inconsistency.

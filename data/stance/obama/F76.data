It's been a while, still as crazy as ever I see.   "He has treated the president of Israel terrible"   Regardless of how he may or may not have treated the mass murdering war criminal Netanyahu, his policy towards Isreal has been exactly in line with previous presidents, I hear this accusation from crazy right wing nut jobs that Obama is anti-Isreal, it simply isn't true, the US continues to give Isreal the green light to indiscriminantly kill Palestians, kick families out of their homes, steal land that deosn't legally belong to them. etc....etc.   "His hero is an anti-American racist who hates whites….Rev. Wright"   Wow. Have you ever given a moments consideration in your life to how hard it is for a black man in your country?   "Then there is his affiliation to communist radicals…many of whom he appointed as Czars in his administration."   How do you expect people to take you seriously when you sound like an escaped mental patient?  Hey, did you know 90% of all black men are secretly working for the USSR, thats right!!!, they never disbanded, thats what they wanted you to think..(insert maniacally laugh here).   "He failed to handle the Gulf Oil spill in a timely manner."   Yes, a Republican candidate would have been all over that, just George Bush after hurricane Katrina, right?   "them after Glenn Beck calls them out"   Glenn Beck, seriously?   "Wants total amnesty for illegals."   Ya, only real americans should have amnesty, like the comanche, the mohican etc.   "Does not even know basic American geography and thinks there are 57 states."   Ya, Palin or Bachmann would ave aced that one, them being the upstanding intellectuals that they are.   "So much for Christ eh?"   Don't worry God will protect you from the destruction of your ccountry.

Yes. Economists expect employment to be back by the end of 2010.   Are these the same  economists  who failed to forecast the current economic recession? Would they also be numbered in the consensus of  economists  who have never foreseen a recession? Are they also the same  economists  who’ve never seen a stimulus bill they didn’t praise? Are they also the same  economists  who faithfully always promise a future of economic hope, lower un-employment, and greater riches? Are they the same  economists  who can foresee the beginning of economic good times and yet never do foresee the beginning of economic woes? Are these the same  economists  who are to be blamed for the mantra “house prices will always appreciate”? Are these the same economists who are paid to forecast good-news? Are these the same  economists  who refuse to invest their wages despite their prognostications about the economy? Are these the same  economists  whose powers of divination are measured by consumer confidence?  Shall I continue…?  BTW, Obama will be awarded the Nobel Prize for economics because of his intention to save not only the US economy but also the economy of the World.

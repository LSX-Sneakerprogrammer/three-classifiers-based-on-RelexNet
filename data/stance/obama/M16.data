I have read economic books, textbook and leisure. My favorite is Free to Choose by Milton Friedman. Sorry I guess that I don't have a PhD in economics like you do. What hole? You are in the hole.  Since you are an expert on economic bubbles, please grant me your expertise on what a bubble is.  Oh wait. I already know.  An economic bubble is commonly used term to describe an economic or business cycle that is best characterized by the rapid expansion followed by the contraction in a economy often times in dramatic fashion.    I am pretty sure that I said that before because I explained it in a previous statement. "Economic trough is consequence of a business cycle after there was a peak in expansion. Many areas of the nation experienced double-digit-percent declines in house prices where they peaked in expansion and dipped to a trough in contraction."  Pin me down. OK, I can handle it.  Medicare. Sure. I don't want to see your grandmother die because no insurance.  Medicaid on the other hand. No. Able people, they should pay for their own health insurance. I shouldn't have to pay so they can be subsidized at discounted rates.  Regulatory Institutions. You said, Remember TARP? That thing everyone went ballistic over when it was passed before Obama took office to prevent the total implosion of the financial sector? Financial regulations on Wall Street is the government telling people what they can do with their money and how they chose to invest or gamble.  If you believe that your tax rates are too low, then write OUT A CHECK FOR MORE MONEY. The IRS WOULD GLADLY ACCEPT THAT MONEY. Tax laws are only what is minimally required to pay. There is no maximum.  Social Security includes unemployment benefits. So, if the government didn't tax our wages for unemployment benefits, that extra money people earn without the tax, they could save that money instead getting unemployment benefits if they are unemployed. As for veterans and disabilities, sure they are entitled to social security. They both earned it.    we DO actually have to pay for things we ask the government to provide  that is why we have a 1.3 trillion dollar deficit and a 12 trillion dollar debt. Yeah, I guess we do pay things we ask for the government.

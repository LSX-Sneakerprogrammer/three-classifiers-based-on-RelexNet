He is really no different than the status quo, and is offering no change. We really need someone who will take us in a different direction. All I hear from Obama is the same I hear from everyone else, "more big government, more big government, more big government". McCain and Clinton are no better. I'm just waiting to see who the libertarian candidate it. Anyone up for that party, except Barr, looks good to me.

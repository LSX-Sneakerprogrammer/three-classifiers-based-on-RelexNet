Thank you Mr. Economist for your thoughtful analysis. Oh... what's that? You're not an economist? You're just some dipshit who watched a few episodes of Glenn Beck and thinks he knows everything? Let's see what the actual economists have to say...   http://www.pbs.org/newshour/video/ share.html?s=news01pa98     http://digg.com/dialogg/ Timothy_Geithner_1    Oops! Looks like the people who actually know wtf they're talking about disagree with you! Obama is doing everything in his power to clean up the messes that piled up over the last eight years.  What the hell does sending or removing troops have to do with banning torture? Not a damn thing, that's what. It's a fact that Obama has  banned torture .   I believe he is doing exactly as he should be doing with regard to Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq we are slowly withdrawing. You say we're not, but  you're  wrong  . Again you demonstrate that you don't know what you're talking about. In Afghanistan we are building up. This is because more troops our necessary for us to succeed there. What do you think we should be doing? Pulling out of both countries immediately, overnight? Think about the chaos that would result. Is a stronger Al-Queda something you're interested in being responsible for?

It only looks like unemployment is down because they go off the stats of who is on unemployment. They don't count the people like me who can no longer receive it and still are out of work. I'm just one of the lucky ones who can afford to go back to school instead, and make an attempt to change careers to something that will always be around despite the economy. Stats can be manipulated anyway someone wants to to benefit their position. I don't fall for the BS.

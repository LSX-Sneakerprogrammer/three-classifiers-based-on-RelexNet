I feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent.   Good thing I provided the second link to show how it's still relevant.   In a recession, were millions become unemployed, he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of US presidents just in unemployment benefits, keeping the people alive.   Even if you want to use the expense of welfare argument, that is not NEARLY the amount that went up in spending under the Obama administration. Unless Corporate welfare counts...  As well, Military spending and increased subsidies for various businesses. And continued Bank support, provisions for various organizations. More importantly, the unnecessary welfare spending that continues to rise but provide no benefit but only to create government dependence.  All of this at the expense of small businesses that try to compete with large businesses in a heavily regulated market.   The war was his choice to enter,   One that Obama continues, and even expanded by bombing Libya and progressing the disaster in Pakistan.   Buffet tax debate (estimated to save 47 billion by 2022), I would disagree.   Which will do practically nothing to cover the costs that he continues to spike. It's a red herring.   Ryan's plans were the ones that led to this recession   I was referring to his proposal on Healthcare, not something a decade ago (that actually also led to economic prosperity. If it wasn't for the war, Bush would have a much better legacy in economics).   he applies his unconventional ideals to everything, and it would just be a bad thing overall.   His ideas are consistent and rational. the're based on expanding wealth and diminishing most government powers that have put us here in the first place. People seem to act like government is so important that it's okay to allow it to choose winners and losers (as it has done through regulations and restrictions). Ron Paul and other Libertarian thinkers believe that individuals benefit the most when they have choice over what to do with their own property.   Reducing spending on social support, and taxation, increases inequality, and disproportionately affects the poor.   Is this why welfare reform resulted in economic prosperity? Is this why FDR almost made the Depression worse until the War started?  If there is any kind of spending that has ever helped economy and the prosperity of citizens it has historically been Military Spending. Yet that is one of the MANY things that government has boosted its spending in, and even so, just because military has been successful in the past doesn't mean that it's the only way.   Even so, helping those who truly can't help themselves is still a small portion of government spending.  edit: The Soviet Union had industrial progression, but this was also, technically, military spending. As for their agriculture, 27% of the food provided for the people was from private farm owners, even though they took up 1% of the total agricultural community of Russia.  Historically, as we see, overall wealth goes up with privatization, no with government welfare.  I agree that some welfare may still be necessary for those who need it most, but at the rate it is now (and how both Obama and Romney want to continue it) is not going to help increase the standard of living.

He's not the worst president in US history. Jimmy Carter probably takes the wrap on that one.  Obama and Bush have expanded the powers of Federal government the most since FDR. The national debt has increased more under Obama than any other president, and if the Supreme Court doesn't rule Obamacare unconstitutional, the national debt will exceed anything anyone could have dreamed of in the 90s.  So I'm very much against the Obama administration, but I wouldn't consider him technically the WORST.

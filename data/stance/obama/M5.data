Since the problem with the health care system in the US has never been quality of service but rather ability to  access  that service, I think I'll just ignore you since you have no idea what you're talking about and go ahead and include health care reform.  Hmmm, what else, what else. Were you alive when he took office? Did you have access to any media? While you were accessing that media was anyone talking about the economy by any chance? We were in the steepest nose dive the economy has experienced since the Great Depression. Now where are we just a little over a year later? Projected 6% GDP expansion this year. Thank you very much stimulus measures. And my 401k has most of it's value back. Perhapos you don't have one, but I rather appreciate that.  Remember TARP? That thing everyone went ballistic over when it was passed before Obama took office to prevent the total implosion of the financial sector? It's almost all    paid back    now.  We can do stem cell research properly again.   Most of the government agencies are getting restaffed with people who actually have some freaking clue what the job is supposed to be, which is refreshing.   Our international relations have practically been completely reset after the US became a pariah in half the world during Bush's term. We're slowly but steadily getting the hell out of Iraq where we never should have been in the first place. Proper focus has been returned to AfPak after Bush and team horrendously neglected it for years. We've been rolling up senior Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders at an increased pace as a result, we've even got Pakistan actually actively contributing to the effort for a wonder. He managed NOT to go grandstanding and screwing up the situation in Iran when the election protests erupted, which I absolutely guarantee the GOP would have immediately tried to spin for political advantage by beating their chests and declaring their support for the protesters... a more certain way to guarantee they'd be instantly crushed I can't think of.  Etc...  Refresh my memory... what did the last guy accomplish in his first year? Besides blow the surplus he was handed on a silver platter by throwing it away on tax cut give-aways primarily to the rich and completely ignore every intelligence warning on al Qaeda until 9/11 happened that is?

Bill Clinton won approximately the same percentage of white voters... did they only vote for Bill Clinton because he's black?  Face it Axmeister, as much as you want to blame the black man, as much as you want to wallow in your dilusion of white oppression, as much as you would like to obsess over race and blame it for this or that or an election, the fact is race had nothing to do with it.  The fact is a black man is president because he was the best candidate, and right now he is doing much better than McCain could have done.  Now go cry yourself to sleep over your hurt white pride.

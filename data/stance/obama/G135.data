I'm with the rising poll of isolationist that believe Afghany war is going to add more debt and spend 500 Billion to help a country that only has two paved roads in the entire country. I was hoping that Obama was to withdraw troops and start to focus on America's problems. 500 billion to give to companies to help build up there infrastructure. Afghanistan is not a threat to us, the attacks of 9/11 came from America where we taught them how to fly our planes.   And we are to believe general McChrystal, the same general who lied about the truth of Pat Tillman's death? It's all about perception and money big business getting contracts is what this war is about.

Well, your excused!!  Sure, bankers and unscrupulous speculators and con artists destroyed many jobs indirectly with their risk and irresponsible business decisions, but those jobs were directly lost to fear, inactivity and no confidence in the economy.  However, the real problem is the Federal Reserve, the central bank who provided the money for the bailouts and were supported by the government. If the Fed were to end, sound money would reign supreme and end the influx of inflation and bailouts. If bailouts were not guaranteed by the Fed and the government, these banks would have strong incentives to practice responsibility and prudent business decisions; plus, the government passed laws requiring banks give loans out despite the ability to pay.  The problem with government stepping in or demand side economics boosting investment are 3 factors. One is inflation unless you love inflation, in order to reinvest, more money needs to be printed; thus, it devalues the currency, and it actually hurts the poor and middle class in the long run because wages increases can't keep up. Two is higher taxes. Since the government has very little ownership, they don't own assets. They have to tax to pay for these investments. Three is if no higher taxes, then it is increasing debt, which is just as bad as inflation.  I completely agree that the war machine and corporate welfare is wrong. War can only be funded by unappropriated or levied resources where the government must print more money in order to pay for wars. Corporate welfare simply means no bailouts to failing companies and support those with sound business decisions.

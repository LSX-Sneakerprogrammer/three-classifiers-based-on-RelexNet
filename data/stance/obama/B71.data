I prefer Obama over Romney, but only because Romney is utterly corrupt and insane.  Obama has not done that much harm. Obamacare hasn't been tested yet, but if it works well to save people money, then I'll be happy.  If it's a massive, useless drain, then ehh. USA was going down the shitter anyways.  I wish he'd fund science a bit more though. Not just NASA, but make a lot more grants for research.

Ron Paul could never win North of Tennessee in any political capacity.  His ideas are too simple.   Not that I don't like some of what he does, however, some of his ideas, simple as they are (flat tax) simply do not work in the real world, and most understand they are not doable.  No one has a chance if elections were today. Even at his least popular he's been more popular than either politcal party, and more popular than any potential candidate.   If unemployment is still above 9% in two years there may be someone who can beat him. That likely is not going to happen though.

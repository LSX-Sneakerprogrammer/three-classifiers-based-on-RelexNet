in my point of view No. Obama didn't deliver favor, his attemts to change something was not so succeful. During his carreer as Prezident country was in a risky situation. People in USA dont want to elect Obama again becouse he has baffled them. My friend Will from USA and i was chating with him about this topic.He said that no need to elect him becouse his promises in most cases NOTHING. Americans position become risky.

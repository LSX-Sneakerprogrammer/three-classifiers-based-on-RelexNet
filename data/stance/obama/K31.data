He is actually trying, the only flaw is that we the people tend to expect a lot out of our leaders, as many did when Obama was elected. The only reason why people even see him as a bad president is because they expect him to do so much that he is actually trying to fulfill in his presidency, since most of us thought we got a superhero who would automatically make things better. However, he is human, and we should let him do what he needs to do to help our country. For Bill Clinton, a great president, also faced this same dilemma so chances are we could have another Bill in store for our country!

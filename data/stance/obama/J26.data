Jesus some people are retarded.   @ Itsnotright:  Banished? You didnt even spell it right you redneck retard. What are you doing on a computer anyway?  As for the question. Because most Americans are as stupid as "itsnotright" I would have to say that the economy has to just start making a come back around the time of the re-election. If it gets better and stays better earlier then all the gun toting gay hating people will come out and vote for the republican. If it doesnt happen at all or only minimally then people will blame him for not doing a good job and will vote the other way.   I voted yes on this question because I do think he will bring the economy around but I think it will take about three years which is right around election time.

Obama says one thing, and does another.  Pulling troops out of the east?  Obama sent more troops there, twice as many as there were before.  Not gonna put lobbyists in the white house?   http://americaswatchtower. com/2009/01/29/ president-obamas-white-house-is-filled- with-lobbyists/    Not gonna use signing statements?   http://opiniojuris.org/2009/07/01/ did-anyone-oppose-signing-statements- just-koh-the-aba-and-some-guy-named- barack/    The notion that Obama has actually done something besides what Bush has already done is based on the fact that Obama makes a lot of empty promises and then makes a bill that says "he's tHINKing about doing them." Yeah, the dude's thINking about quitting smoking too. Obama and Bush work for the same people. Obama's just a thousand times more intelligent, inspirational, charming, and charismatic. All he's really done is made people believe that whatever he does, whether it's continuing the wiretapping that bush advocated, banning guns, or sending more troops to the middle east, it's PROGRESSIVE and trendy. Everything's gonna be ok because Obama is in charge right? His allegiances aren't to the citizens of the U.S. and it's not to the constitution either (he's done a lot to change or ignore it). He works for corporate America: banking, wallstreet, and the new world order.

Boy you are brainwashed, all the stuff you have mentioned does what for the economy, all presidents before him do all of the same rhetoric you are mentioning. Almost 90% of economist and business people a like say that OBama's policies and lack of business know how is what's making things worse. Good luck on NOv 2nd your going to need it. Obama is not the change Americans hoped for he campaigned in the middle and ran on the left. He's a socialist a Anti colonialist. That's how his dad taught him that's why he returned Winston Churchill's bust back to England his dad despised the Brits for colonizing impoverished nations. Obama is driving this country into the ground, worse president I have ever seen. He hates Amercia and so does his wife Michelle

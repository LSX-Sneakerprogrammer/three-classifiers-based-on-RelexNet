Obama doesn't think there are 57 states. He clearly misspoke and was talking about primaries. I'm not a supporter of Obama but your arguments are pretty radical and if anything just unimportant.    First of all he is hiding who he says he is. Took way to long to present his birth certificateâ€¦if that is the real we probably will never know. Never would present his academic records

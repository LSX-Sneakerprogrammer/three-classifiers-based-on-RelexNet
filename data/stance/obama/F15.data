He doesn't know a thing about it.   And that is your opinion.   You're talking about him, right?   Indeed I am.   Doesn't fully support them.   Ha! Has neither openly supported or come out against MARRIAGE rights, but has repealed DADT. Are you actually going to argue that republicans are MORE for gay rights than democrats?! I'd like to see this...   He wants to tax them too greatly.   Ahh. Let's look at his record, shall we?  -  1) His stimulus cut taxes for 95% of Americans.  2) He extended the Bush Tax Cuts.  3) His Jobs plan (American Jobs Act) was over 50% tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses.  4) He has cut taxes for small businesses on 16 occasions.  -  That's a hell of a tax record.   WarWarWarWarWar!!!   You appear so intelligent in your other comments. Why are you know ignoring the facts and yelling party-line, unfounded rhetoric?  -  Again. Let's look at those pesky little facts.  0) Received the Nobel Peace Prize. Now this isn't actually evidence, but it is quite telling.  1) Troop Projections in Iraq/Afghanistan for Summer 2012: 68,000  When he took office: 173,900.  THAT IS A 61% REDUCTION!!!  2) Ended War in Iraq. Self-Explanotry.  3) Engagement in Libya. Tactical air support and missiles without a single combat troop on the ground. Not one.    You mean the terrorism of the American people via TSA   Yes. Because it is the TSA that flies planes into buildings. Ya...   extreme surveillance   Do you mean the racial profiling that will occur with republican immigration laws?   NDAA   I will somewhat concede this. But this can't legally occur during his presidency (see signing statement).  -  But if you care to look at those facts again. Osama Bin Laden and 21 other Al Queda heads (out of 30) killed under Obama. Under Bush? From what I have researched, I found 4.

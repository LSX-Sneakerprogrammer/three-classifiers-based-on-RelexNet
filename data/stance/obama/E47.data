Now let me spell it out for you.  1. I never assumed he was anything. YOU appear to be doing the assuming. Show me where I said anything at all that relied on what race he was? I had no idea what race he was in my first response,    I still have no idea now   , and I really don't give a crap.  2. I never called him a racist. I simply quoted his own words back at him. If those words indict him as a racist in your view... well, HE wrote them. Not me. So deal with it.

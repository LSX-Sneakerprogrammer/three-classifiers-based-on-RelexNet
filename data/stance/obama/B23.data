As for Qatar, it seems that you're living under an oil company and not an actual country like the United States.  If the USA could be as small and focused on one cash crop, sure, things would be better.  But to believe that Qatar is the way it is because of anything but the fact that Oil is one of the most highest demanded products on the planet is really... a misunderstanding of economics.  300,000 people under an absolute monarchy that has possession of one of the largest oil supplies is pretty much nothing compared to the USA, which is above 300,000,00 people and has a very mixed set of resources.   That's like living in a city that shits gold and then saying "see, why can't you be like us?"

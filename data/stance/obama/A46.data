I am anti-Obama. I am not racist, nor do I agree with the comments made about him being only half black. However, some of his slogans and policies worry me. National healthcare (and I know that this is overused) is a good example. Government-run banks are a good example. Government-run anything that was privately owned before Obama came to office is a good example. I'm not saying that he is going to be the one that sends America into socialism. He may be a fluke, or he may be just the first step into the fears of the majority of American people.

Obama is a pro-abortionist. Killing babies is wrong so stop doing it. The new health reform bill is not good. There are some good things but more worse than good. You could have just passed some laws instead of making a whole bill. People are retarted for agreeing with you. Everyone shouldnt have to pay for health care because they might not be able to pay for it because they are not employed aymore because their jobs are shutting down because they need to pay for other peoples health care. Its not are fault if some girl decides to go and have unprotected sex and end up pregnant and want to have an abortion. They should have to still have the baby. They should not have other people pay for their bills because they are young and have no job, in that case they do not have the money to pay for it. Then it will raise peoples insurance to help pay for peoples hospital bills. Last but not least i believe marajuana should be legalized so that all these people wont be going to jail over stupid reasons and the police can focus on the more important things to stop in our neighborhoods.

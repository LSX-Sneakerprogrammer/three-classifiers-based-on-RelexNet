You were clearly writing them out as arguments on their own.   Writing them in this fashion:   Why?  Economy.  Immigration.  Gay Rights.  Middle Class taxes.  Energy Independence.  Foreign Policy.  Terrorism.  That's about it. Feel free to attack any of 'em.  ...that's why  You also tagged your ARGUMENT as yes. Merely writing the word doesn't count.  Anyways. I would like to hear your opinion on how Obama is going to change the economy for the better. Thanks!

How do you like the fact he has denied skimmers offered from other countries to help with the oil spill and he won't let them because of the Jones act?. quote Obama said to Florida Senator.  Florida senator: Obama told me we canâ€™t deploy oil skimmers because they might be needed elsewhere. Nice! Thats like me calling the fire dept to come to my house and put out the fire because it's on fire and the fire dept says they can't because they might be needed to put a fire out in the future that they don't know about yet but if they did then they wouldn't be able to because they would be putting out my fire. Come on Jessald even you can say Obama has failed here.

I agree with those statistics but I don't think we can attribute all of this growth to Obama. I will admit I was quick to say a failing car company is going to fail whether or not we spend billions on them. I was proved wrong. It worked. Obama is clearly against a free market. In my opinion he has great ideas but they are too far fetched. Although he wants to, we can't help everyone! Here is Obama's view  Tuesday, President Barack Obama argued that while a limited government that preserves free markets "speaks to our rugged individualism" as Americans, such a system "doesn't work" and "has never worked" and that Americans must look to a more activist government that taxes more, spends more and regulates more if they want to preserve the middle class.     http://cnsnews.com/news/article/ obama-limited-govt-preserves-free- markets-doesnt-work-it-has-never-worked     Also, and this is not an attack on Obama's stimulus package ( I am here to learn), what jobs did Obama create that wouldn't have been created on their own. I've heard people say governmental jobs, but how many street sweepers can you really hire. I've also heard GM created tons of jobs, but I can't see that being too true.

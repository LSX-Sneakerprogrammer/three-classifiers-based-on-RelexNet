Maybe you should. Obama admits that he wants to redistribute wealth.   Which is not socialism.  Have you ever heard of the saying (paraphrased) "Two rectangles, one is equilateral, the other is not. Both are rectangles but only one is a square."  Redistributing wealth is a characteristic of socialism, like being a rectangle is a characteristic of a square, but it is not the defining characteristic.   Government sponsored corporations include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Farmer Mac  Federal Government chartered and owned corporations include Florida Virtual School (Florida), National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), Tennessee Valley Authority, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Millennium Challenge Corporation, St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Corporation for National and Community Service (Americorps), Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Legal Services Corporation, USPS, AMTRAK, many alcohol retail stores of which 19 states have monopolies, Medicare, and Medicaid.  Federal Government acquired corporations include GM, CITIGROUP, AIG and many others.   Does our state own  all  businesses and corporations? Or, does it own  all  critical utilities?   Not Permanent but Under Nixon and Carter.   Not presently.   Apparently, you should try reading. How about welfare and social security?   So, all the wealth of the top ten percent is divided amongst the bottom 90% evenly?  Redistribution of wealth entails a whole layer of government that controls incomes and aims to prevent people from becoming excessively wealthy to the detriment of others. It isn't as simple as having social programs.

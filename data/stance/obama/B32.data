Well, it depends whether you see 'smart' as a relative value, or as an instrumental quality of someone - whether you feel especially smart because you made someone know they were wrong, or when you achieve something very difficult.  But yes, people like this make me feel very proud of what (little) I know. Intellectual masturbation + all that shit.

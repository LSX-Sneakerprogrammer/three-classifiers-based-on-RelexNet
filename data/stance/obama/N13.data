they were only trying to do what the Federal Government is supposed to do by protecting our borders   The answer is in the question - Immigration is within the Federal purview (within Article 1 Section 8: Congress shall have the power to: "establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization”).  The court challenges seek to determine if SB1070:  &gt; violates the federal Supremacy Clause (Article 6 Clause 2) by attempting to bypass federal immigration law;  &gt; violates the Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Protection Clause rights of racial and national origin minorities by subjecting them to stops, detentions, and arrests based on their race or origin;  &gt; violates the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech by exposing speakers to scrutiny based on their language or accent;  &gt; violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures because it allows for warrantless searches in absence of probable cause;  &gt; violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause by being impermissibly vague;  &gt; infringes on constitutional provisions that protect the right to travel without being stopped, questioned, or detained.

Though even these last 3 states are moving to eliminate non-resident driver's licenses  ref  - and I don't see Obama stepping in to force everyone to issue licenses to illegals.  People want the Federal Government to act, and, under Obama, it has.

1. Well, he's trying. We now have ended military involvement in Iraq like he said, he passed healthcare like he said, we've ramped up involvement in Afghanistan like he said, and the economy has improved somewhat - not as fast as anyone would like, but it has improved.  2. Yeah you did, you said if McCain was black and young he'd be in office. This means being black would be one of the prerequisites. I explained why it was not.

And both the Clinton elections and the Obama election had hundreds of thousands more voters than any Republican election in decades. The numbers say I'm correct.  4. It's my experience that those who "disagree with his politics" like prayerfails below is lost in a sea of right wing blogs and fox and actually have no idea what Obama's politics really are. You're going to have to prove a specific issue in some debate in order for me to buy this argument.

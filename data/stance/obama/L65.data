Your attack on Fox is interesting... I guess you've never seen the O'Reilly Factor.  But anyway:  "Save the auto industry"  We can debate the numbers, but you're not about that (clearly). So let's talk about the ideology of saving the auto industry. Or even better, simplify: Added to the Corporatist system of the United States. Same with bailing out the banks. And for shame... I thought you didn't like the corporations and all their money. Finally, they have a chance to fail and leave their business to bidders, and you support the legislation that keeps them "too big to fail".   "Finally brave enough to fix our ridiculous health care system".  Ridiculous indeed. We waste billions on medicare and medicaid, just to see that they are, in general, pathetic ways to help those in need. I don't disagree with you on that one. My problem is 1. Brave... like all the other presidents who were "finally brave enough" to do something about the healthcare system? INCLUDING BUSH! 2. Government hospitals and Universal Health-care... right, because government healthcare worked in this country all this time... oh wait, our health care system is ridiculous. Darn these intricate fallacies. BUT WAIT!!!! A voucher program, proposed by Paul Ryan, implying that government will continue to help people who are in need of medical care but can't afford it, but instead of choosing what kind of treatment the people will receive, they will be able to choose their coverage in the private sector. This is far better than subsidizing for subsidizing takes away incentive to compete and provide better coverage. But with the voucher program, the private sector will continue to compete for the only way for them to receive that money is if the people find them a suitable insurer. But that's too sensible, right? Nope, let's just get government more involved with running the healthcare system, because if cotton rips all the time, the only solution is MOAR cotton.  But another thing we can agree on, the Republican nominees are looking shitty. Gary Johnson and Ron Paul will most likely not get it, and Paul Ryan is dicking around.

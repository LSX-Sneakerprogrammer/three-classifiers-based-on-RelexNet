Such as? If you say "healthcare" you fail.   Have you seen government spending lately? President Obama's 2010 Budget Deficit was $1.3 trillion.  For every dollar the government spends, that is one less dollar in the private economy, which the economy shrinks, which means less wealth is created.  Here is a predicted graph of government spending, and this is only FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  Graph  So, sometime between 2030 to 2040, entitlements will alone consume the entire budget unless more taxes or less spending.   Black and white thinking.   If you are not an liberal and vehemently support Obama, why are you seeking an dispute of my response?  If so, then what percentage roughly do you agree with ?him   And Dubya.   No, doubt he was a failure.   Well, let's see... the whole 9/11 debacle, Katrina, the choice to invade Iraq instead of Saudi Arabia, The 2007 Financial Crisis, Guantanamo Bay and the black site operations, The Patriot Act, etc.   What you pointed out are failures of government policy. 9/11=Bad Intelligence, Katrina=Bad Emergency Response, Iraq=Warmongering; Guantanamo Bay=Government doesn't torture unless given authority, The 2007 Financial Crisis=Actually 2008, Bad Housing Policy and Monetary Policy, Patriot Act=Big Brother doing its thing.   That bigoted fossil? You're crazy.   Hardly!!

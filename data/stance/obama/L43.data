According to the FAQ and the 'About' page, the score of an argument supposedly represents the community's regard for it. So personally I figured there'd be nothing wrong with voting an argument up without typing a Support, or voting one down without typing a Dispute.  I'm new here, so maybe that's not how it works in practice, but it seems like downvoting an argument is perfectly legitimate...

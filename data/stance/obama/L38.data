THANK TO THE SAY NO REPUBLICANS   It is obvious to anyone who looks at the relationship between the Bush family and oil, with gold, and with big money in general, where their personal interests lie. Cheney and Halliburton, anyone associated with Jack Abramoff, Enron, Carl Brizi and Tim Durham, the list goes on and on. And on and on. Are there any democrats with ties to big business? You bet there are. The difference is that democrats, as a body, don’t seek to exploit their elected positions by introducing and voting for legislation to enhance their personal finances and power.   Cons romance the voters in the religious right, and then do next to nothing to advance that agenda. They appeal to the fears of the frightened, even going so far as to manufacture fear in order to do so. They court the angry disenfranchised middle class white voters with tales of welfare fraud and reverse racism. They lie to those that are self-interested, but not completely without a sense of patriotism or concern for their fellow citizens – they help them to believe that lowering taxes for the rich, deregulating business and cutting social programs is good for our economy.   Would Rush Limbaugh, a multi-millionaire, have any reason to have voters believe that the rich should have a lower tax burden? Would Dick Cheney, who is a major stockholder in many corporations and sits on the board for several, have any reason whatsoever to have the voting public believe that business should be free of regulations, thereby increasing profit shares?   Consider the source, and then investigate the evidence, check the historic precedence and then ask yourself who stands to gain?   The Tea Party crowd idolizes the America’s Founders along with today’s corporate titans, whose taxes must be kept low so they can be the great “job creators.” But the contrast is striking, since the Founders risked everything for the country while today’s rich won’t even take the chance of hiring some extra workers, Michael Winship writes.   Today’s corporate giants, blinded by greed, oblivious to the despair around them, are doing much the same. ` Conservative screenwriter Lionel Chetwynd scripted the introductory film at the site’s orientation center. And Sarah Palin paid a visit during her recent bus tour, just a couple of weeks before our arrival, writing on her website that daughter Piper mentioned to her how hard Washington must have worked “to keep that farm going.”  Stephen Colbert responded, “It’s true. I cannot imagine how hard he worked, with no help other than his African volunteers.” The Fortune 500 generated nearly $10.8 trillion in total revenues last year, up 10.5%. Total profits soared 81%. But guess who didn’t benefit much from this giant wave of cash? Millions of U.S. workers stuck mired in a stagnant job market. … We’ve rarely seen such a stark gulf between the fortunes of the 500 and those of ordinary Americans.” Hypocrites, because their radical free market ideology, and the resulting total deregulation of the financial markets, is what caused the debt to spiral out of control this last decade. That and the wars George W. Bush launched but didn’t have the integrity to responsibly finance. The consequence was a banking bubble and crash leading to a 50 percent run-up of the debt that has nothing to do with the “entitlements” that those same Republicans have always wanted to destroy. again according to Erickson, were giving it plenty of credence. In an “open letter” to Congressional Republicans he wrote, “despite what the pundits in Washington are telling you, it is you and not Obama who hold most of the cards...Should the United States lose its bond rating, it will be called the 'Obama Depression.' Congress does not get pinned with this stuff.”   the United States Senate issuing the Levin–Coburn Report found “that the crisis was not a natural disaster, but the result of high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; and the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.”[10][11] Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets.[12] The repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 effectively removed the separation that previously existed between Wall Street investment banks and depository banks. There is some debate as to what role the repeal of Glass–Steagall had on the late 2000s financial crisis.[13] In response to the financial crisis, both market-based and regulatory solutions have been implemented or are under consideration.[14]  Consider the terrible consequences of the 'anything goes' Bush Administration, whose irresponsible non-regulation of financial institutions has led to this crisis."  George W Bush - that in the eight years of his presidency he actively pursued policies of deregulation which caused the biggest financial and economic meltdown since the Great Depression.   He certainly presided over a widespread failure of regulation.  On his watch, the US authorities did little to prevent the sale of millions of mortgages to people who could never afford them.  They failed to police the market in mortgage-backed securities which has now collapsed with such devastating consequences.  And credit default swaps, those multi-billion-dollar bets on other people going bust, went virtually unregulated.  In recent days, Congress has been holding hearings to determine how the regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) missed numerous warning signs - "Red Flags" - about Bernard Madoff, the man accused of running a gigantic Ponzi scheme which has defrauded investors of at least $50bn.   Deregulation started long before President Bush came to power, and it was enthusiastically pursued by both Democratic and Republican administrations.  Here is just one example:  The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated the activities of commercial banks, which take deposits, from investment banks, which invest money. It was repealed in 1999.  That relaxation of the rules enabled commercial lenders, like Citigroup, to trade instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations.

Are you kidding me?  He deserves credit. He saved the economy, is stopping wars, and is doing great things for our country.   Your against him 100%, but you don't care anything about anything he has done. You against him and you are against the war, and you are in a complete mindset not to accept anything he does.   And the past 8 years? Well first of all, you mention the war as if its a bad thing. Do you also remember; Economy, Debt, foreign affairs etc.? Bush was ruining a lot of things in America. Obama is fixing them, and helping more better things happen.  As for Change, are aware of what he has done? He has changed our situations across the world, has had our number 1 enemy (Osama) killed, helped keep the economy from crashing, and made great leaps and bounds for peace across the world. If you believe these changes aren't 'good' then think it over for a bit.   And finally, you believe there are several other people who would do better as him, but would they really? Do they have enough experience expertise, intelligence, etc. to keep our country alive?   Seriously, think about these points.  You have a strong opinion, but make sure you aren't ignoring fact.

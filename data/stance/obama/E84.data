The answer is still "no".   The answer isn't "no." The statement, "Obama bailed out the banks" reigns true. Regardless that Bush signed the bill that made that the appropriation of the money possible, it became Obama's bailout when he enforced it. He had the power not to disburse that money to the banks. He chose to do so.   Fighting strawmen doesn't make your case.    Where is the strawman? That is exactly what GM did. If you saw this commercial, would you think GM is still owes the taxpayers $43B?   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=SSNPFVLIWjI     The ~$7billion was the loan. The rest was purchased shares, if I remember correctly, and wasn't a loan - but carried an expectation of being bought back by GM or some other investor. They used the escrow funds to repay their outstanding balance.   Which in my opinion is the functional equivalent of a loan. Giving money with the expectation that it will be paid back.    What would you have them do with the escrow funds, precisely: keep the money, use it to hire some prostitutes and screw them while high on mountains of coke?   What I would want them to do is give back ALL the money. Every single dime. File Chapter 13 bk, reorganize, manage their debt, renegotiate union contracts, and then take a second shot at the apple once they got their shit together. If they succeed, wonderful. If not, then let them fail and more profitable businesses will scoop up the resources that are now free after liquidation.  Not pay back a portion of it and then put up a facade that they're making money.

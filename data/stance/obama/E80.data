Uh...The "Bush" bailout of the banks was done at the request of then president-elect Obama. Congress appropriates money...the executive branch spends it. You do the math.    http://www.npr.org/templates/story/ story.php?storyId=99243620    The GM was paid back?! BWAHAHAHA! Don't think so big guy. GM used TARP money to back TARP money. The so-called loan that was paid back came from an escrow account funded by TARP money. Read for yourself or do a simple google search:   http://reason.com/archives/2010/04/27/ gms-phony-bailout-payback     http://seekingalpha.com/article/ 174888-gm-s-phony-bailout-repayment    The taxpayer isn't getting jack shit paid back. The only thing we'll be getting is inflation, higher taxes, and raised insurance premiums thanks to healthcare "deform."  Keep drinking that Kool-Aid!

This country needs leadership throughout all branches of government. This country needs leaders who are willing to make difficult decisions, despite the political fallout. We need one who loves this country, truly understands the values we seek to live by, and implement policies that are consistent with those values. We also need someone that is willing to recognize the policies that have worked in this country in the past and around the world and those that have not. We do not need an ideologue. We do not need arrogance. We do not need to be treated like ignorant, lazy people that have no passion, drive or work ethic. I could go on, but I simply encourage all of you to put your party affiliations aside and objectively think about these comments as you decide who to vote for. Our country is at a turning point and has significant needs. We cannot afford for voters to retreat to the political party talking points.  Research the issues and do not rely on your 10 minutes of daily news. Think. What is truly best for our country?

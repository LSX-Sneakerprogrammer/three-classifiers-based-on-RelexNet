Fact Check: The Stimulus Bill and ACORN    Maybe you should watch something other then Republican shill news once in a while? I recommend the  PBS Newshour .  Debating itself isn't stupid, but this debate is stupid. It's just partisan bickering. What Obama did or what Bush did has little to do with the real issues our country is facing.  You want to pull out of Afghanistan? Don't you know what the consequences of that would be? The Taliban would probably take over, and gain power in neighboring Pakistan. Pakistan has nuclear weapons. Is a nuclear armed Al-Queda a risk you're willing to take?

The vast majority of people who voted for Obama did so because they recognized him as a capable leader. The only people who ever call him a messiah are Republicans making strawman attacks.  He would be able to accomplish a lot more if the Republicans in Congress would cooperate. Right now they are purposely doing everything they can to hold him back, just so they can watch his approval rating go down. Fortunately he seems to be slowly moving forward despite their obstructionism.

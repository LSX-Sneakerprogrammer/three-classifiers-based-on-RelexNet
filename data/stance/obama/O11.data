He has been one of the best presidents in modern times. Here's why in no particular order:  1) Unprecedented economic recovery.   a. Unemployment  b. GDP  c. Corporate profits  d. Markets  e. consumer spending  2)He  single-handedly  saved the American auto industry.   3) He ended the war in Iraq. He has released plans  4) He has killed 22/30 top Al Queda Heads and crippled the organization.  5) He has improved out world stature, and improved relations with other countries.  6) We have the lowest dependance on foreign oil in 20 years.  7) He has encouraged green energy investments and approved the newest nuclear power plants in 30 years.  8) He has started relieving states from the abomination to America that is No Child Left Behind.  9) He repealed DADT.  10) He has fulfilled the vast majority of his campaign promises while breaking only 13% of them.  11) He has compromised even with the intransigent republicans on 50 of his promises (compared to the ONE compromise the GOP has).  12) He is a small spender (only $300 billion in non0recession new spending over the next 8 years).  13) He is turning the tide of illegal immigration by placing more boots on the ground and more eyes in the sky.

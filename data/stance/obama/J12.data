And ffs, it was obvious that when I said "conservative ideologues", I was using the term to mean politically opposed to liberals. Any reasonable person would have seen that. Stop being intentionally dense.   Explain to me why it is  obvious . Because nothing contained within your post would allow me to validly infer that you were referencing a republican or something similar.   (Do you not realize the ambiguity inherent in the term  conservative ideologues ?)  Shall I explain?   This is the extraordinary claim that I am referring to. To support this claim, you would need to show a comprehensive review of predictions by mainstream economists…   Very well!  Who do you consider to be mainstream, and how many failed predictions of the same do I need to present? I could submit thirty failed predictions of thirty economists of the past ten years. However, you would then argue that   A. they are not mainstream  B. that thirty is not enough  C. ten years is too long or not long enough  D. or whatsoever else may suit your denial.  I think you ought to study the history of The Glass Steagall Act and the consensus opinion of economists concerning the Act. You will find a lot of evidence that may just try your trust of mainstream economists.   (Many economists assert that today’s economic crisis can be directly traced to the repeal of Glass Steagall which occurred in 1999.)   I find it extremely laughable that there is not one iota of reason contained within any of your arguments which would justify your blind-trust of the consensus opinion of economists.   Now, allow me the license to appeal to your sense of reality. In the last thirty years, and more quickly the last ten years, there has been an uninterrupted progression of the transfer of wealth from the lower classes to the upper class. The record profits of Wall Street are occurring at the same time that record wealth is being lost from the common man. Now, explain to me why most mainstream economists are not advising anything other than more of the same? Hell, we can go back thirty+ years on this truth of reality.  Conclusion:   Go ahead and trust the consensus opinion of mainstream economists and likewise observe the continued transfer of your wealth. And perhaps you may learn that maybe, just maybe, the economists are effecting policy for that very purpose. Consistency establishes intent! A man (economist) who consistently advocates policy that transfers your wealth to another is guilty of seeking to transfer your wealth.   I thought liberals were for the little guy? Well, I am no liberal, but I certainly am for the little guy.   What say you?

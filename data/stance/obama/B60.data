First let me say that I am slowly getting the impression that this is a site for kids and young adults. Some of the answers, and definitely a lot of the spelling and grammar indicate as much. So I realize now that I must take some of these debates with a grain of salt.  Having said that, this is what I say to people when they say that a particular President was the worst. In your adult life assess your economic standing under every President. Figure out which negative economic phases are attributed to yourself and which ones were caused by government forces. Of the ones caused by government forces, separate those caused by your state, and the federal government. Of the one(s) caused by the federal government, how many were caused by direct government legislation (do your thorough research)?  I can continue on, because of a two house congress, and stubborn party affiliations, but I am guessing, that most of the bad stuff in your life is YOUR own fault, not the fault of federal laws. Human beings, especially in America, love to point fingers and blame every one else for our screw ups. Your life is screwed up and the President (whose only been in office for 3 years) is the cause?  Reassess when your life began to plummet, I think you will find that it goes back farther than 3 years.

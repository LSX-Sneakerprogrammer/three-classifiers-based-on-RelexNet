He's shaping up to be possibly a top 10 president if he continues on the path he's followed so far... the odds of anyone chalenging him in 2012 who is of similar calibre are pretty close to non-existent. Especially from the GOP, where people operating at that level frankly simply do not exist right now and couldn't win a primary against the "Tea Baggers" even if they did.

I was responding to the part where you said the "majority of America doesn't want Health Care". That's not true.  As for Georgia, I would need a lot more information before jumping to any conclusions. It seems like there should be a way for the UN to take action even if one country doesn't want to. Also, since you didn't cite a source I'm going to presume the quote is out of context and misleading. It seems ridiculous for you to be picking some tiny, obscure statement made a long time ago and using it to make Obama seem dumb. If that's the best you've got it just shows how rarely he says dumb things.

When Obama took office we were losing on average 700,000 jobs per month.   The economy hit the trough of it's business cycle, and by suggesting Obama stopped the downward spike has no truth.    Last year Republicans filibustered over 200 times.   Where is your link of proof?   Of course though in 6 years Republicans will just elect another frat boy or actor to ruin all the hard democratic work again   Ronald Reagan had to clean up the mess after Jimmy Carter.  Bill Clinton wasn't a frat boy. He admitted to the use of marijuana in college.

No, he should be one term and done president. What has he done, but increase the national debt? He ran on the platform that he was going to create more jobs to stimulate the economy. Well? No, he has been in the office for over 2 years now and I really don't see how he has helped the american people. He didn't get my vote in 2008 and he won't get in in 2012 either.

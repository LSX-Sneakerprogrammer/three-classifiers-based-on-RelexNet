The economy was already taking a nosedive when he stepped into office, and when he tried to pass his jobs bill to fix it, republicans vote it down and then proceeded to blame him for high unemployment. Strange how that works.  The Auto-industry was on the verge of collapse, when he came into office and now it's going strong. GM specifically was 17 months away from bankruptcy and now it's stocks are soaring and it has already paid back $11.8 billion to tax payers, 5 years ahead of schedule. Of the bank bailouts 66% of it has been paid back already. These averted bankruptcy and saved millions of jobs. Had we have let these industries go bankrupt, unemployment would have rocketed to levels not seen since the last great depression. Now add to that the fact that under His presidency Osama was killed, Gadaffi was killed, Egyptian President Mubarak was overthrown, and the Iraq war was ended. Considering all the problems we face I'd say he's doing pretty well.

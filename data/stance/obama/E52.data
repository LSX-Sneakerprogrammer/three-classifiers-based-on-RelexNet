I know you will agree with this.   Everyone in politics is a populist these days. When you have Sarah Palin talking about "real Americans", the distinction between wall street and main street - blah, blah, blah... it's populist rhetoric. Who cares if he's a populist? Is that a mark against him now?  But besides this, your initial argument is absurd. And if it's not, please justify it.

radical foreign policy   The way this country is going we're in need of some radical changes.   He is old   Nothing wrong with that. His mind's sharper than his competitors by far and, besides, Rameses II reigned into his 90s, and countless others have served as head of state at a more advanced age than Paul.   insufficient popularity   Yet he practically ties with Obama in nationwide polls.   Although he seems pretty smart and has had some good ideas and some popular ideas, he doesnt really fit the bill.   Why, because he wants to raise the country out of its current state and back to respectability?

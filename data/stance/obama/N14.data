why has he not done anything about the Illegal aliens problem ?   If I recall correctly, I remember hearing that he has already signed 2 republican-led bills to increase border security. After a third bill was pushed, he commented that no matter what he did republicans wouldn't be happy with border security until there was a moat with Alligators in it.

The last eight years was not Bush's fault stop watching MSNBC and go educate yourself on the real reason. No matter who was president nobody was going to stop the bond market from what happened. It was just unfortunate that it was at the very end of the Bush term if you believe that than your just an idiot. Do you know a lot about Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae I do they are run solely by the democratic party and I can go into more about that because I have first hand knowledge of them and the types of people who work there. They kept buying non conforming loans for years and the overseer Barnie Frank and Dodd turned there heads. There is more to it than just party lines Republican or Democrat I can give a rats ass. I have multiple business's one real estate commercial, I manage money for a company on bonds. I maybe not an actual economist if i decided thats all I wanted to do I could since I have a minor degree in business school on it and I work in the field where I need to know. And I don't know everything that would be very narcissistic of me but when I see your lame ass debates and can see that you are the dip shit yourself who is insecure about a topic that all you can do is go google it and then find something that suites your political beliefs instead of making your own educated guess, your just a biased person no matter what will always look at the liberal side whether it makes sense or not. Here's some homework for you why don't you go look at states that are ran by your way of thinking like Minnesota, Michigan, California, Ohio all of these states have had nothing but Unions and Democratic rule and they are now bankrupt or heading there. You won't find this statistic in ANY Republican state. So let marinate in your head for a while.

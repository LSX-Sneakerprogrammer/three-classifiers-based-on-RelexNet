I think you misunderstood what I was asking. I'm not asking if this model can be exported around the world, I'm far from naive. I was simply asking your opinion on what the government does, as a Libertarian. Considering much of what you complain about is the economic aspect - government takes your money & fucks up the economy - since all the Qatari government does is inject money into the system &#40;money from oil, which a private company could have got, granted&#41;, I was wondering how you felt about it.  Essentially, whether you're a pragmatic Libertarian, or purely principled. Just out of interest.

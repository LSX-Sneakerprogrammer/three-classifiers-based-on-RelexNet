Get that shit off. Socialism does not work. Just look what's happening to Europe right now with their debt crisis. It's ironic that you posted this 142 days ago and I'm now looking at it in relation to what is happening to the worlds markets it's because of Socialism that the system is collapsing and thats why Great Britain, France, and Germany all now are governed leaders who believe in free markets and the conservative party. I will say some Dems and Libertarians are also conservative. But this guy is going nowhere his idea just got pummeled in countries who had a Social agenda and now they have turned against. Once again how ironic that I haven't looked on this website for while to see you posted this 142 days ago. A lot has changed since then. Maybe you can see the truth to governing just by that mere fact. I will say one thing about this guys 32 minute speech a waste of time, because he was wrong.

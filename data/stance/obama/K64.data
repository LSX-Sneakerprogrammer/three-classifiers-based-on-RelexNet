No! No more politics as usual! I want someone in office who will push for less government, more freedom for the people, less taxation, humbly take up the office of President, someone who is invested in this country personally (i.e. John Boehner, he was crying because of his elevation to speaker, he has a heart for this country and it shows). President Obama will always hold my respect but I do not want him in the white house again.

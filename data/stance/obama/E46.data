Let me spell it out for you then, and I'll use very short sentences to make it easier:  He thinks Obama was only voted in because he was black.  You think the poster is white.  Because you assume he's white and he doesn't like someone who happens to be black, you called him a racist.  You made a decision based completely on race.  You appear to be a racist.

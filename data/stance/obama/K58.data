Which hasn't done anything except waste 1 trillion dollars on borrowed money.  Proof: 9.7% unemployment in America.   It's debatable. I prefer not to get into it because it will be a few years before we can gauge its effectiveness without polemics.   Which is a waste. Money wasted due to two warmongers, Bush and Obama.   I don't think so. While I would have preferred Saudi Arabia to Iraq, it still gives us a possible ally in the middle east (it's an Islamic State however, so that might be in vain). It also rooted out a number of terrorist factions in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The big disappointment is that we allowed them to make the state a theocracy. This means that there is a strong possibility that sectarianism will continue in Iraq long after our forces leave, and that the government will ultimately make an enemy of us.   Creating jobs and wealth is interchangeably linked because if jobs are created by producing an new good or service, then wealth is created, so in a capitalist economy, government has no assets to produce anything without taxation that is taken out of the private sector, government doesn't create jobs and wealth, it merely transfers jobs and wealth from private to public.    I think you contradicted yourself. If the creation of jobs is interchangeable with the creation of wealth, then it must follow that the government creates jobs (and wealth) whenever it creates new organisations (like NASA, the FBI, Military branches, etc.).  Those are not transferred jobs because there was never a private sector equivalent.   1. Taxation doesn't create new jobs or wealth because it only transfers wealth from one who creates new wealth. Sure, government employees received incomes, but it is at the expense of those who produce. Government employees don't produce anything new, they only take from the general public.   They produce technologies and monuments which are too expensive for corporations to create. Examples being space exploration and all of our military technology. Taxation takes surplus wealth from producers and uses it to fund the creation of these things.   3. The worst source of additional government spending is creating new money either by simply printing more money or lower interest rates. Thus, this monetary event always results in inflation by eroding the value of the currency, and consequently, it started the Great Depression.   Right. Except for the last point. The great depression was caused by insider trading and corruption of the stock market.   "In a capitalistic economy, labor and capital freely flows to the most productive enterprises precisely because they’re the most profitable. All government can do is inefficiently redistribute wealth that the private sector creates."Wealth 2  "But it is a fallacy of the Keynesian legacy that government can reduce unemployment by priming the pump with spending programs. Government needs to reduce spending and taxes in order to leave income in the hands of individuals who earned it and who can spend it much more efficiently than the government can." Jobs 1   If the market works like Natural Selection, and businesses behave like animals, then Keynesian policy would merely be that which applies artificial pressure to the evolution of business. If this is true, then it follows that the market's behaviours can be changed to correct social problems like unemployment.   "Governments have only three ways of paying employees — taxes, borrowing and printing money. Each of those reduces income and wealth among those paying taxes, servicing debts or stuck with shrinking greenbacks. In short, governments can't "create jobs." Adding government jobs is never a net addition to employment opportunities, because it means a heavier burden on private employers and employees. " Jobs 2   If this is true, then private businesses may never create a net addition to employment opportunities because they produce a heavier burden on other private businesses and employees, because a private business "charges money for a service (same as tax), borrows money (loans), and prints coupons (similar to printing money practically)."  What I would be interested in hearing is how a tax is different from a sale, practically speaking. I'm not interested in how you're compelled to pay tax, because force is irrelevant to the immediate equation, which is the creation of jobs (and wealth) through the trading of money.   "When the government attempts to create a job, all of these natural forces are removed. The market has produced no demand for the government-created job. In other words, no buyer has voluntarily agreed to purchase those services, because to do so under current market conditions would be unprofitable. Were it profitable to hire someone to do the government-created job, an employer would have done so voluntarily. So, the government steps in and forces the taxpayer to purchase those services against his will. In additional to violating the taxpayer’s rights, the entire coordination that existed between employer, employee, and consumer is disrupted. " Jobs 4   Force, either real or perceived, is irrelevant to the equation. Force only matters in a discussion about social rights. In the discussion about economics, what matters is that money changes hands.   To illustrate further, this is what government does to destroy wealth or job creation because it thinks it can create jobs and wealth. WATCH VIDEO   Those state sales permits and laws which prohibit business startup are usually motivated by business interests who wish to stifle competitors. It's how capitalism works in democracy.   More insurance isn't going to contain costs in premiums and deductibles. It is only going be more expensive. When you buy a car, you pay for what you get. If you want a Mercedes E-Class, you have to pay for it compared to a Ford Fiesta. More coverage = more money. This is what the bill does, just more insurance.   Right. We also needed it, since our healthcare coverage is so poor in this country.   As for Embryonic Stem Cells, it should be left to private research. Polo's cure was invented by a private scientist, not government, where in the goodness of his heart, he donated it without patents for profit.   Government-funded research exists because most research is costly and unprofitable to the private market. It is costly in the case of medicine because of laws imposed due to our lessons learned with free market medicine (remember Radithor and Snake Oil?) and due to the lack of ethics in general which existed (the Smallpox vaccine was tested by picking a vagrant child off the street and injecting him with the virus, for example). Polio's researchers and early efforts to make a vaccine used a similar lack of ethics: 3000 children were injected with an unsuccessful mixture which caused allergic reactions in some of them.  In other words: government takes over where private industry would fail or be less successful.  As to the stem cells: you can thank Bush for regulating stem cells in the first place. Obama rescinded his laws.   As for Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal, we will see how effective it is in the years to come. One way or another, I don't care. Military recruitment should be non compulsive and open to anyone regardless. Why does the government need to even know your sexual orientation? WHY RED TAPE!! That is irrelevant to a solider.   It didn't, and wouldn't ask, as long as you didn't provide it. However what happened was that many officers and recruits were discharged annually because they were spotted in gay clubs on shoreleave, or "outed" by malicious coworkers.   Again, you are an odd creature, you absolutely chastise business because it is inherently corrupt and greedy, but get all sympathetic for big business when they go bankrupt because of bad management. Where is your sympathy for when small bushiness goes out of business? There is none because that is business. Bad management equals failure, and you support it. No wonder you like government. You enjoy bad management.   I'm not sympathetic for big business. I care about the thousands (perhaps even millions) of employees who would lose their jobs, pensions, etc. because a handful of sociopaths gambled with the system. When you've worked your entire life in a career and you lose everything, it is tragic. I feel bad for the people.   Doesn't matter. It was still failure of government. It is central planning at its finest. A series of failures, but no sees that. It is government attempting to control to many things, and it fails.   I think it does an admirable job handling the roads, sewers, water, schools, medical research, space programs, and research.  I certainly know that only a state could afford a project as big as the Large Hadron Collider.   Looks like someone has a conspiracy, someone who doesn't engage in conspiracies.  That controversy is as accurate as the Obama not born in America.   If it's a conspiracy, I'd like more than just his word that he didn't say it. You are the one who is suspicious of government and politicians, so I shouldn't have to tell you than I don't take any politician at just his word. The best I got was that the grammar of the writings don't match his style.

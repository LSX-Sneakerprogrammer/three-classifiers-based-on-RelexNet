This candidate about whom you may not have heard, for he's rather hush hush: Ron Paul   I've heard a lot about Ron Paul actually. I respect many of his policies and views, but I feel that he does go too far at some points. For example, I've heard of his wishes to leave the UN, his economic views are risky at least, and he would simply bring civil unrest to the country, with the amount of change he would bring. I like him, I can easily imagine him as a strong Vice President, able to speak with a strong voice about issues which should be talked about but aren't, but not as a head of state.  I understand his support, he's something new and refreshing to politics, and he would eliminate many problems, but that doesn't mean he's the best choice overall.   Now that's just plain old elitism.   I'm sorry if you took it that way, but it wasn't how I meant it. I don't support Obama perpetually, I simply meant that I see him as the right choice from the available candidates, especially if you look at recent developments in the Republican candidacy, they're ripping each other apart. I would be prepared to support a Republican, if they were a better choice.

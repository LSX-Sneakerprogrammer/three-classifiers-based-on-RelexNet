Those numbers are not writ in stone.   They actually are. By the way, did you see Ron Paul's pathetic finish in Florida? That is not a good sign for the Paul campaign. I have nothing against him. He's just never going to get the GOP nomination. And are you going to simply ignore my counter-arguments to your Obama views?

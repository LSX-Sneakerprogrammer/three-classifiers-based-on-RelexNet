Please. The Bailout was  joint.  Bush signed it and Obama put it into effect. I made that point earlier. Learn what the branches of government do. And now you're splitting hairs. You were clearly implying that the taxpayer was being made "whole" because the loan was "paid back." You can't pay off a credit card, using a credit card and then claim to be debt free. $6.7 billion out of a total $49.5 billion was given back and then advertised as "GM Pays Entire Loan Back Plus Interest." That is a lie. Congratulations, GM gave back what they didn't need from a bailout that they shouldn't have received in the first place. This like congratulating a retard for being able to piss in the toilet even though they managed to still smear shit all over the walls.

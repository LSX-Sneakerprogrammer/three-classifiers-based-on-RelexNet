Since the year Obama has been President the debt has increased by a percent similar too, and less than the debt increase during any given year of the Bush administration. In short, the Bush administration on average increased the debt more/ year.  Where was your whining then? You were on this site when Bush was pres.  It's an odd trend. I find that there is some deep dislike for Obama, yet when each reason for this dislike is analyzed in comparison to other Presidents it is easily seen that the reason mentioned, in your case spending, is not the reason at all.  I'm curious, why is it  really  that you dislike him? We've established it could not possibly be spending since I know you supported Bush on several occassions without a word about spending here on this site.

Simple: Listen to some of them talk. Listen to Fox News talk about them. Listen to popular people among them talk, like Sarah Palin or Newt Gingrich.  Given, Newt isn't stupid, though he's a little evil, almost like Dick Cheney. But, if you listen to many of them and are not dumbfounded by some of the blasphemous crap that comes out of their mouths, then I have no idea what false logic you follow, because there are indeed many, many,  too  many Republicans that are just saying things that you'd expect to be uttered by mentally traumatized and disabled people.  Disclaimer: I do not deny that there are smart Republicans. There are. But they are dying out, becoming rare, and not even considering themselves apart of the party a lot of the time.

The first article is not false? Why then, why I search the authors name in Google, do I see, on the first page, two articles specifically stating that he's wrong when it comes to debt + Obama? Links:  1  &  2   I liked your second article more, it seemed less biased, and it did raise two good points. First of all, Obama is supposed to spend more in a recession, government spending should counter the business cycle. Bush had no real reason to continue the deficit in the way that he should have, whilst Obama had the biggest recession in modern history. To get back to your original point, of how Obama has increased debt more than any other president, I was simply pointing out that it's hardly a fair comparison.  Second of all, Obama's tried to increase tax on the upper classes, and the corporations, and been blocked by Republicans. Again, it's hardly fair to call him 'the worst president ever' when the results you are using against him are not of his own making.  But, as I said originally, I don't think Obama deserves all of the love that he gets from the 'Left'/liberals/democrats, whatever you want to call them. He is currently the best of a bad lot. I remember looking through the official comparisons of the various candidates economic projections, and yes, it is true that Ron Pauls cut the deficit most quickly, and therefore debt, but it did so at the expense of the economy. The Libertarians look to 'save' the economy, but at the expense of the people who it is supposed to help, and this is where I feel that Obama does well, and the Republicans do neither.

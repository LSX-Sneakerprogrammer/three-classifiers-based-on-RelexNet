It's a catch 22 really. If we leave the country will descend back into chaos, and most likely back into the hands of a terror reigm. If we stay we continue to spend ourselves into debt as our service men continue to die.   Exactly! So why did he promise he'd get them out? It doesn't matter how far fetched his promises were, the fact that he couldn't keep them is the problem.   The same reason band-aids don't heal bullet wounds. The bailout was only slightly lessened the affects of this economic downturn. It doesn't alleviate or address the root of the problem.   Then why even waste so much on it? If it cost so much and had only a small effect then wouldn't it have been better without it?   Because we're spending trillions of dollars on a war with no end in sight, and the housing bubble collapsed along with our domestic automotive industry. Did you know Bush was the only president in history to cut taxes during a time of war? Where were his financial advisers when that decision was made? We're going further into debt because we're spending as much as we ever have and yet we don't have the resources to back up our spending.   Then why is it so hard for Godmaba to cut spending? Why does it seem like he thinks that MORE spending will help the economy?

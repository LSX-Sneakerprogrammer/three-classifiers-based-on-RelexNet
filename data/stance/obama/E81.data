Uh...The "Bush" bailout of the banks was done at the request of then president-elect Obama.   That's not even what the article reports. The article pertains to a potential (at the time) Obama request for additional funds not already released in the Bailout process (that was allocated in the Bailout). The Bailout had already been put into action and wasn't done at the request of Obama. You're interpretation is wrong.   The GM was paid back?!   Yes. GM ultimately used their loaned money to repay their loan. Get the fuck over it. The next time you take out a loan and realize you don't have to use all of it, make sure to never - ever - use any of the residual to help pay back your loan. There's something wrong with that, according to you.   The taxpayer isn't getting jack shit paid back.   My assertion was that taxpayer money was returned, not that it was being returned to the taxpayer. We let go of that money. It's not "ours" anymore, it's money that is to be used by the government.   The only thing we'll be getting is inflation, higher taxes, and raised insurance premiums thanks to healthcare "deform."   Okay.

I strongly believe that Obama should be given a second term. Since Obama has been in power, he has been trying his best to make certain achievements. We all know, that in the state that our ecomony is, it will not take weeks or months but possibly years to fix or embetter and for this reason, we should give him another chance since his leadership has cultivated many presidential achievements. We tend to blame him for not trying his best to embetter the economy but what we are failing to understand is the fact that this is his first term in office and the economy is not something you can fix in a second, it is a critical aspect that requires careful thought, planning, analysis and actions which can take several years. It is also through President Obama and his supporters that the health care bill, legislation to curb green house gases and improve the environment passes, preventing a second great depression by saving three large car manufacturers from going out of business and which would have possibly leave hundreds or thousands without jobs, and also passed the largest economic stimulus bill, bringing the war in Iraq to an end, thus saving the economy a lot of money and innocent lives from being taken, nuclear non-proliferation movement, repairing our image abroad, reversed George Bush's ban on federal funding to foreign organizations that allows abortion, lifted Bush's ban on embryonic stem cell research, implementation of education system reform, tobacco regulation, financial industry reformation, appointing two Supreme Court Justices. These are the presidential accomplishments achieved by Obama and these are proof that the president is determined to fullfill his promoses he had first made to the nation. Now, it is our turn to give him the chance he need to do so and give him some more time.

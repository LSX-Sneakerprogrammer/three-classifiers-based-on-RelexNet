Btw, I want your opinion on something. I live in Qatar, which has a large government sector, mostly in banking and petroleum. This generates a massive portion of its GDP, over 60%, and it therefore charges minimum levels of tax. My parents only pay import tax, no VAT, no income tax, and massive subsidies on energy (petrol & electric).  The government spends billions trying to improve the country, ensure long term financial stability, building infrastructure, maintaining culture, and provides its national citizens with the most extensive benefits system in the world (most nationals get about $1 million throughout their life, if they're born today).  Is this government bad?

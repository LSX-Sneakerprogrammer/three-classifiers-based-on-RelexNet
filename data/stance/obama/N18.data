No, for many reasons. First, and most simply, Obama has fairly low ratings. Lower than what is usually necessary to get re-elected. Also, just recently, the American public voted in a lot more republicans to the house if that tells you anything about the majority opinion of democrats (which Obama represents). People are also disapproving (for the most part) of the legislation he has introduced, particularly the health care act. Even many liberals are angry with him because of how many compromises he has made with the now republican house so he may not even make the nomination.

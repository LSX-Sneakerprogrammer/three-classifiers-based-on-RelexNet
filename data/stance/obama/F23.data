was looking for a clarification   which I have given. Jobs numbers. Unemployment. Even specific examples of empirical evidence.    in a more general scope he was talking about how a free market doesn't work.   Well, a purist free market doesn't work. But that's not what he was talking about regardless.   how in the world is that crap from a bad source.   I was referring to the article. It claimed he was anti-freedom, anti-limits on government. The title was misleading. There were convenient breaks in the quotes so they could be patched together in a way he didn't intend them to be said. But the vieo itself shows he was talking about no such thing.   I am sure you are a very intelligent person   not really.    I'm sure treating people like crap on here really helps you get through the day.   Who did I do that to? The authors of that article...maybe. But if you are referring to the previous comment, then I was simply agitated that you would cite "evidence" without having even looked at it yourself.   Can anyone please explain what other jobs have been created by Obama   By Obama? None, really. Besides the stimulus packages and the staff he brought with him to DC. Creating jobs is not the role of a president directly. Their job is to create an environment suitable for SUSTAINED job growth. None of this roller coaster volatility we have seen in the past 3 decades.   you seem pretty miserable    nope.    Also, I don't mean to be willfully ignorant.   I realize that, and I apologize if it did not come across that way. The evidence is readily available. And you have tagged your arguments as "NO" so there must be a reason why. I have posted the key figures in a previous comment to you. What else are you looking for exactly? Housing prices is an area (the only major one really) that has not improved. But I wouldn't expect any significant improvement considering it was built on a bubble. In fact I would be wary if they did begin to grow significantly soon. I am here to learn as well. If you have a counter-argument to my points, feel free to post them (please no more of that CSN news stuff ;) ).

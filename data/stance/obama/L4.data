That's an interesting thought--"and start savings and investing." Care to expand on that? I've never taken a formal course on economics, and the idea of a nation  investing  never occurred to me as anything realistic...could that actually work?   Still, though, the government serves a number of really important functions, like education and maintaining infrastructure. I'm not sure how much more spending it can cut without harming the public--we're already seeing huge cuts to education...

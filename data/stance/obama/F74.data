Because market anarchy without checks and balances via some power in which people have a say (government) leads inevitably to serfdom at best and straight financial slavery more likely--all whilst roads crumble around us and only rich kids (inhereted rich after a generation or so since without checks on large corporations they can simply steal any idea and make it cheaper) get an education...  And only between 10% and 20% of the half-retarded american population is that fully retarded during any given election. So yeah, that's why he'll forever be "out of the contest" outside of Texas and a couple southern states.  Plus he's been spewing government all in your vagina outlawing abortion while hypocritically preaching smaller government when it comes to feeding the kid the impoverished and rape-e's are forced to take to term.

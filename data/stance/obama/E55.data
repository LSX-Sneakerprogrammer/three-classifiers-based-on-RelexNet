No those are not facts. You are calling him a Socalist but he is not a Socalist. Why don't you look up what a Socalist is before you start accusing people with your so called "Facts." Heres a fact for you, the leaders of the Socalist Party of America often critize Obama and they often get angry that people associate him with them. He is not a Socalist so therefore all you are doing is name calling and you are not giving the facts.

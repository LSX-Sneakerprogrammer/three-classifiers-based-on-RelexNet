Good thing I provided the second link to show how it's still relevant.   Good thing that that article said that the entire 'comparing debt' idea was stupid, and that they're all as bad as each other.   Even if you want to use the expense of welfare argument, that is not NEARLY the amount that went up in spending under the Obama administration. Unless Corporate welfare counts...   Of course, but the $700 billion spent on stimulus, increased welfare spending, and decreased tax revenue, it would make a big part of the difference.   One that Obama continues, and even expanded by bombing Libya and progressing the disaster in Pakistan.   I haven't personally, but I bet if you compare the costs of conflicts that the two leaders started, you would see a massive difference. However, yes, I agree, Obama's foreign policy is not perfect. Part of why I have repeatedly claimed that he is simply the best of a bad lot.   Which will do practically nothing to cover the costs that he continues to spike. It's a red herring.   43 billion is not a small amount, and yet it is Republicans who continue to block it. This is not Obama's fault.   I was referring to his proposal on Healthcare, not something a decade ago (that actually also led to economic prosperity. If it wasn't for the war, Bush would have a much better legacy in economics).   I agree, I was saying I don't trust him because of what happened a decade ago. And Bush's deregulation (under Ryan's plan) lead to the market crash and the recession we're still in. Yes, the times of prosperity were good, and Bush's, but that doesn't mean it was a good thing overall.   Even so, helping those who truly can't help themselves is still a small portion of government spending.    http://www.newsmax.com/US/ Catholic-bishops-Ryan-budget/2012/04/17/                                       id/436184     http://thehill.com/blogs/ blog-briefing-room/news/ 222003-catholic-bishops-criticize-ryan- budget-cuts-to-food-stamps    And yet the plan you support feels that cutting this  small portion of government spending  is necessary and justified. I'm not arguing the left v right economic perspectives, I'm simply arguing that cutting all forms of social support will hurt more those who need it the most. I don't see why that's hard to accept.

This site is more user based than other debate sites. Much less regulation.  It can be bad since, yeah, we have little kids with shitty arguments and debates who come on this site a lot, but they're usually ignored by the more serious debaters. Basically, a debate will get much action if it's a decent one.  What's good is that we don't have to worry about any kind of censorship or abuse of power. You're not going to get banned for saying something edgy (or even REALLY edgy). You won't get banned if you didn't match a criteria. Instead, a creator of a specific debate can restrict your participation from within that specific debate if they feel that you are being improper in the format.   Once again, user based. More freedom, but with more liberty comes less security (in this case, annoying users).

A Fight I'm willing to have is Obama out of his mind. Does he really want to economy to get better? Why would he say something so asinine. Then if he is going to tear apart the banks then he needs to also tear apart the Unions for making GM fail and also for Fannie and Freddie which then he would have to go after his own lobbyist and tax them as well.  The vial has been lifted the wizard behind the curtain is showing is true character and Identity and the American public is seeing it before there eye. They are in panic mode. The ship is sinking fast and the rats on the ship become become more exposed.

There are, naturally, different opinions. As a general rule, downvoting should probably not get people's panties in a twist, but then again...  Downvoting without a rebuttal is generally seen as cowardice. Indeed, if you want your side to win, why not downvote (losing a point for that side, but also yourself) and then provide a point of your own in dispute (adding a point to your side, and gaining one for yourself)...of course that point itself may be a target for downvoting, but if you have said something worthwhile in rebuttal, you have no reason to worry, right?

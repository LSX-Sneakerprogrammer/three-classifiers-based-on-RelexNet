Unless Obama shifts more to the center I see no way other than national emergency that he will remain in office. My support could have easily been yes and the same argument applies. The radical Saul Alinsky type blinders the President has are becoming manifest. But Barack Obama is still a rock star who no doubt has more tricks up his sleeve.

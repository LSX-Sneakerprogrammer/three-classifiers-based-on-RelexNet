Point by point:  1. Only because republicans have broken the country's record of filibuster 2 years in a row now. That's like blaming a fireman for running into a burning building but not being able to save everyone in it.  2. Of course you will, after all it was his fault we went there right... oh wait he was one of the few senators to vote against the war to start with &gt;&lt;  3. True. And it will be shown if anything that the bill should have gone further.  4. It took almost 10 years to pull out of the great depression. We hit the peak of the second worst recession in our history only 2 years ago.  5. The vast majority of people do not vote based on color, and just as many people would automatically  not  vote for a black person based on the color of their skin as they would for. You're logic is still retarded. Bill Clinton won, he was a democrat, he wasn't black. Jesse Jackson ran once, he  didn't  win, he is black. Only those obsessed with race are clueless enough to actually believe race had anything to do with it.  6. Hm, I would say judging by the previous president's performance compared to Bill Clinton's performance that it is the Republicans who suddenly show up for elections who have no clue.  7. Then you have little experience in the matter. I for example seem to be much more aware of this sort of thing and I voted for Obama.

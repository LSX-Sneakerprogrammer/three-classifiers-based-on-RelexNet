"That aside, we have clearly lost jobs, as unemployment has gone from 6% to 10%."  Unemployment counts only people that are seeking employment, so in reality your argument holds no real merit because either more people are losing jobs or more people that had stopped looking for jobs, started looking again after the stimulus, therefore making them counted as unemployed. Really there's no way 2 be sure either way.

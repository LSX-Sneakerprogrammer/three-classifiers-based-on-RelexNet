Yea I thought so. But, was that not the same problem that kept troops in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was dealt with?   The very same. We didn't know what we were getting into when we entered Iraq. We quickly defeated Saddam's Army, so officials thought the fight was over. They were wrong.   That does make sense, but when has that actually happened? Surely this has failed more than succeeded?   We spent our way out of the great depression. Paying for tanks and planes. Paying for rifles, uniforms, and ammunition. Expenditure at this time was unprecedented. Someone had to make these materials. Factory workers suddenly had income again, and they could go out and spend their income. This spurred the economy.

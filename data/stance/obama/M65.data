he's making all these promises and yet he has not fulfilled any of them!   He just passed Healthcare reform, which is actually historically amazing, job loss has slowed, and our economy is improving.  I think he's done just about the best that is realistically possible in this short amount of time in any representative republic.   Lots of people who voted for him our now just realizing that maybe his isn't so good after all   Actually his approval rating is still very high for any president during a recession. If an election was held today he would beat any generic Republican candidate. It's Congress I think you are thinking of when you imply people are upset.   The major #1 reason he became president was because most people voted for him because he was going to be the first black president (not being racist)   Statistically the total number of African voters who showed up for this election, who have not in previous elections, adds up to around 1% of the entire voting population. Considering he won by a greater margin than any candidate in recent history pretty much proves race did not play a role.  The reason he actually won by more than Bill Clinton, the last Democratic President, is because there was a greater overall turnout.  A greater turnout always leads to a democratic victory, because the majority of people who usually would not vote are liberal while conservatives almost always vote.  I'm not sure where you are getting your information in recent debates, but you seem to have a very shallow world view.

You have to support Obama by default. Yes it is very conceivable he is not the best suited president, but when you consider the other candidates it's disturbing he almost lost. While there is certainly no rule saying the more intelligent candidate is necessarily the better choice, in this case that should be the only thing considered.    John McCain, once a very viable candidate to lead our country, has inevitably aged to a point where his health, mentally and physically is a legitimate concern. Now pretend for a moment Sarah Palin was randomly picked to be the vice presidential candidate. If this were true we could just begin by picking apart why she is not fit for the job and why it would endanger America if she did become president. But for McCain to pull a stunt to try and steal the presidency as if it were a beauty pageant (no pun intended), he has just proved that he does not believe he is "A" the best choice or "B" going to win the election.    Now with it being a conscious decision of his to appoint Sarah Palin, you have to be disgusted by the fact that Sarah Palin isn't even qualified. It would be tolerable if Palin was in fact per say a moderately qualified running mate, but she is not. Sarah Palin jumped from community college to community college, and while that doesn't imply anything on it's own, after further research one can conclude that it is because she is not a hardworking and or intelligent person. And secondly she is a delusional Christian fundamentalist who doesn't understand much less appreciate science.   If Sarah Palin were in office she doesn't even have the knowledge to make decisions, not to mention she doesn't have the smarts to make an informed decision even if she did have the knowledge. Obama is a teachable intellectual who has the capacity to learn and conclude, he graduated from Harvard Law. Does Sarah Palin even have a BA from anywhere? Everyone should be thankful that Obama is the president regardless of allegiances, no rational person could actually think that while times might be tough, if Sarah Palin were currently in office that anything would be better off.

No, his policies are crap.  He ignores that majority of America doesn't want Health Care but he still pushes it through. Ignorant much?  Health Care is another way of  Theft  for the government.  They take your money and give it to someone else and themselves.  Being forced to have insurance or your given a fine on your income? Wow, totalitarianism much?  Six states are performing a law suite against this. It will go through congress and get passed.   IT is unconstitutional to run a bill through that has already been Vetoed!!  That just provides evidence that none of you people give a shit about the foundations of this country.  Health Care is a Gateway for more government control.  If you don't believe that your a fool.

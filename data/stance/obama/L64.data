Really, can I quote you on that one?   Yes.   A cowardly ducking of a legitimate argument. Way to go, lefty!   On it's own, it might very well be a legitimate  point , certainly in another debate and with another issue. But, in the context of the preceding posts, it was irrelevant as a response, and sought to change the meaning of the word "accomplishment" (from its  first use to its second use  - the equivocation) to fulfill its aim. The question wasn't whether or not what President Obama has done is  universally appreciable . It was a question of what he has  done  for the country. He  did  those things. I have no obligation whatsoever to address whether everyone considers the things he has  done  are  creditable  or not. So, I disagree with your characterization of my response.

"Sure, he should be granted credit for instituting progress towards socialism."  What is wrong with a de-centralized planned economy? It is not taking away your democracy. Rather, it encourages more democracy.  In our current capitalist societies, 5% of the population controls 95% of the nations wealth. A nation that disproportionate sounds more like a caste system, not a democracy  A de-centralised planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of worker cooperatives; planning of production is done from the bottom up by local worker councils in a democratic manner  In other words, giving people MORE freedom.  Do you hate freedom?  or just the word 'socialist'?  "Sure, to a certain degree. Only because of bad government policy."  Yes, but not HIS bad government policies. He had to clean out the monkey's cage.  "What was so bad about the last eight years besides the war?"  US withdraw from a number of international treaty processes i.e.Kyoto protocol  public protests occurring even during visits to close allies, such as the UK  the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession  "Doesn't mean that it is change for GOOD. He never said Change was going to be for the better."  it was implied. There is absolutely no way you can argue that he is actively trying to change things for the worse.  "Ron Paul"... supports eliminating most federal government agencies, calling them unnecessary bureaucracies  If Obama is a socialist  Ron Paul is an anarchist

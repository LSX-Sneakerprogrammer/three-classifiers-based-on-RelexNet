Right now, this is a major global world- we're connected in ways that were thought nearly impossible just fifty years ago! The boundaries between countries are fading, so what we need now is a great FOREIGN POLICY president and if Obama is good with one thing, it's with keeping debates, being respectful, and connecting with global leaders. The U.S. has never been in a more critical global part in our lives- we import 62% percent of our oil!- and we need the good will of other countries, especially Asian superpowers whether we like it or not. Obama already proved himself efficient in this case: it took him just two weeks to convince Egyptian dictator Hasni Mubarak to step out of office. It took a year for Clinton to do the same with another unstable leader!  We already know he's a good foreign policy leader; I think that in the next four years he'll have experience enough to be a truly great one... like President Truman. Besides the president can't really control the economy all that much (too complicated to explain now) so shouldn't we elect our leaders based on what they can do?

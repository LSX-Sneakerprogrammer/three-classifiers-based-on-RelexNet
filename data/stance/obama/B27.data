your clarifications aren't showing in my argument feed. but anyway, it's no doubt that Qatar is doing quite well. I've already said that. However, an entire social and economic system to be dependent on government exports is kind of the point that I was making. Qatar has to run itself like a business to keep its employees (citizens) happy and working for the government. And it is not a free market just because it pulls in Capital (Hitler pulled in Capital but delegated most of the citizens to work for militarist goals).  Shell and Exxon make billions because of Globalization. Not because Qatar allows "free markets."  And the social aspect has much to do with with my justification for little (not no) government. A social system with a terrible economic system is not a good social system. People will have little access to goods and services of better quality if the private sector is limited and heavily regulated. As explained in my many posts before, overall wealth goes up with the pursuits of the private sector. This has been evident in transitional periods for the Soviet Union and China, which portray the greatest examples of binaries in their economics.  Society benefits when they are free to trade with each other and when they are free to compete for consumers. When free trade is restricted, people will never be able to get the goods and services that they need (unless you restrict the population itself).

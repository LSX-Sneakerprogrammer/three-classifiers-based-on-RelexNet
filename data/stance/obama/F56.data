i dont think you are correct in thinking that keynesian economics didnt predict the dot.com and housing bubble crash, keynesian economics takes into account market cycles, the rise and fall of overall economic activity.  How well did the austrian economists predict the two crashes?   I am a compatiblist, so if there are limits to keynesian economics i would be interested in them. What is it about Austrian economics that makes it better?

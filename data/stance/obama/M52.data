Oh look, you're still making this ridiculous argument.  Yes, please do folow your genius plan. Hand the system your free money while receiving zero benefits, then cross your fingers and hope your serious ruinously expensive medical emergency calls ahead and makes reservations with you so you can go get insurance before it hits and you don't bankrupt your entire family.  The rest of us will put all those dollars you're handing us to good use, promise. Unfortunately we cannot promise to give them back to you to pay your hospital bill when you wake up there and wonder if it's too late to get insurance to pay the bill they're handing you... and good luck finding any insurance policy that kicks in retro-actively.

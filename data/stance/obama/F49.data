Voting for Ron Paul wouldn't solve anything. His ideas start of OK, but then they go way to far. He wants to pull out our foreign troops. Sounds good. All of our foreign troops. Well that seems a bit much but OK. And he wants the US to become completely isolated from the rest of the world as well as, not only back out of the UN but also evict the UN from New York City. Does that not seem like a bit much to you? Not only that, but additionally, he wants to get rid of civil rights laws that prohibit segregation. How did that work out for us when segregation was legal? He even wants to get rid of federal highways. Even if he was elected, nothing would get done since congress would refuse to pass anything he created.

Congratulations, once again you have a post that says nothing. "I don't have to say anything because it's obvious."  The irony is the only one who hasn't written anything coherent so far is you. If you have something to say, say it, but your "I don't have to debate because the answer is obvious from your posts" remarks are literally a waste of space and have no room on a  debate  page.  Learn to express yourself before you call other people incoherent...

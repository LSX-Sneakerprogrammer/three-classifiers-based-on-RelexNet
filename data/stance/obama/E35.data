I’m a Dr Ron Paul kind of guy. I don’t vote based on the better of two evils. I’m from Texas and I’ve never voted for bush nor did I ever vote for his dump ass daddy. I really could not vote for obama because once he signed his name for the bailout that was a red flag enough for me and it really should have been for all of America. But no they had to put the first negro they could find into office and look what we have know. A mess for many generation to pay the tab on.

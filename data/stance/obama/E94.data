Obama won because or country was so pissed off with Bush that a turtle could have successfully ran against him. People didn't vote  for  Obama, they voted  against  Bush, and unfortunately, our country was too angry and stupid to pay attention to the platform of our current Eunuch-in-Chief. Everyone was "Oh, cool! He's black! He went to Harvard! He's going to "change" things! There's "hope"! Yay!" Obama missed his calling as a used car salesman.

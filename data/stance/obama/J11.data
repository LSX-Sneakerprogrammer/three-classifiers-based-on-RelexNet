Yes, the mainstream was wrong and some on the fringe were right, in the case of the  current recession . But you are using this mistake to imply that the mainstream therefore should be trusted less than the fringe or that they should not be trusted at all. This is the extraordinary claim that I am referring to. To support this claim, you would need to show a comprehensive review of predictions by mainstream economists -- to show that they  consistently  get things wrong, while the same fringe figure  consistently  gets things right. Like the old saying goes, even a broken clock it right twice a day.  And ffs, it was  obvious  that when I said "conservative ideologues", I was using the term to mean politically opposed to liberals. Any reasonable person would have seen that. Stop being intentionally dense.

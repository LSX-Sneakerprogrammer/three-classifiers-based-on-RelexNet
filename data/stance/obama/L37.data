And what do you make then of Obamas miserable and failed presidency? Oh here come the excuses.  He has been a COMPLETE FAILURE.   Hey you got to check this out.....its hilarious and shows how stupid Obama REALLY IS, that he can't say anything without a prompter. Also shows his educational level.    http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=QxXh6ZWfbDg    "The bomb (singular) that fell on Pearl Harbor."  "I had an uncle who was part of the first American troops to go into Auschwitz and liberate the concentration camps." The problem being...American troops did not liberate Aucshwitz, the Soviet Read Army did.  "On this memorial day as this nation honors its unbroken line of fallen heros, I see many of them here today." But doesn't Memorial day honor the dead, those who served and died WHILE IN MILITARY SERVICE ?  And how could 1965 events result in a 1961 birth? Obama the storyteller. Does not need teleprompter to feed lies.  And then when he talked about Hugo Chavez (his close friend) he got dates wrong when accusing Bush of things....when he was not even president, Clinton was.   Then there is his expertise in geography.   "In the last fifteen months...we have traveled to every corner of the United States. I have traveled to , lets see....uh....57 states with one left to go...with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii. So total that up.....57+1+1+ 1 left to go. ....60 American states wow...what a Harvard education he got.   And he pronounces Massatoosits........just like that.   "Eau Claire is a beautiful state" I believe its a city, he better check his map or better yet fire his speech writer.   He doesn't even know what states border eachother.   And in Sioux Falls South Dakota......at a rally he calls them Siox CITY. He doesn't even know the difference.   So he can't get facts straight how about his knowledge of figures?  Like the tragedy in Kansas where he said the entire town was wiped out 10,000 people died. Only twelve died.   He is simply an idot..who got elected by people who did not care what changes he made.   Then he says that he will be serving as president for 10 years. He doesn't even know how long a term is.   And show me one politician ever....that looks more like a boob than he does....in this video of him at the town hall meeting.  He doesn't even know the facts..........can't present them and people don't seem to care...  So honey if you think the Republicans look silly......and you think Obama is the role model of what a great president is all about then.........man, I question your sanity on this.

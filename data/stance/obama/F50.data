His ideas start of OK, but then they go way to far. He wants to pull out our foreign troops. Sounds good. All of our foreign troops. Well that seems a bit much but OK.    They don't belong in other countries. That's why we call them  other  countries, they aren't our own, therefore we don't belong there in a militaristic capacity.   And he wants the US to become completely isolated from the rest of the world   It's not quite like that. He's for international business, but doesn't think that the government has any business in interfering with other governments affairs.    not only back out of the UN   We ought never have become involved in such an organization; it relieves us of some of our sovereignty, however slight, and that is never good.   but also evict the UN from New York City.   UN would collapse without US support, most likely.   Not only that, but additionally, he wants to get rid of civil rights laws that prohibit segregation.   Again, you are looking at it from the wrong angle. I am not legally required to allow any individual into my place of residence, my home, my castle; why, then, if I own a café, must I allow those individuals whom I dislike to enter my place of business? Both my house and my café are my properties, why is there a difference? My café is not public, and should therefore not be required to accept any member of the public within its walls.   How did that work out for us when segregation was legal?   I'm white, so pretty fine.  Still, though, would you, assuming that you are white, eat at a restaurant with a big sign on the door saying "niggers keep out!" Probably not, and most people wouldn't, either. Therefore, racist store owners can either keep their views to themselves or go out of business; it behoves them to do the former.   Even if he was elected, nothing would get done since congress would refuse to pass anything he created.   Even if none of his ideas came to fruition, we'd still have four years with a president refusing to sign any more liberty-crushing bills.

So is the economy more stable now? The evil banks and the taxpayers just made 10 Billion off Citi that report came out today. So when Obama plays it like taxpayers were on the hook for the bailouts and that it cost us. Umm no Obama i think again he doesn't know what he is talking about when is relates to the banks. What he should have said that we will never get the money back from the unions he supported because they are bankrupt but you won't ever hear him bash his union lobbyist buddies.   Oh wait he has done something for the Oil crisis instead allowing oil skimmers to come here he would have then to get rid of the Jones law temporarily so that it wouldn't impeded his loyalty to his Union buddies. Even in a crisis he stays true to his unions voters. It's sick. If Bush would have done this people would be wanting his head.

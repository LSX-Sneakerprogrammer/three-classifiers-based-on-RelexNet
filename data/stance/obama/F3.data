Why, because a Republican ruined the country in the first place? If you look back throughout history, you'll see that the whole mess began in the '30s with a Democrat.   Specifics? And you're aware what the Southern Strategy was I hope.   Obama's had four years and he's utterly failed, but electing another Republican you mayn't be reelecting Bush, for there are differences betwixt Bush and the sole worthy candidate.   Specifics? You've seen the job growth chart, read the healthcare bill and seen we're leaving both Iraq and Afghanistan I hope.

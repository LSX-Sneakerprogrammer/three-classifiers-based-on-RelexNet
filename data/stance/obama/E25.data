"they will probably lose everything in the next two elections."  I think that people still aren't over all of Bush's fuck ups yet so there probably won't be a huge change to support for Republicans. They had that special election in Pa. was won by a Democrat a couple days ago so I think that this next election could really go either way for the Democrats. I think that everyone is just tired of the establishment and wants to get rid of the incumbents. So I guess since Dems have a majority, they are the bigger target but the fact the people are still pissed at Bush, balances out both parties chances of victory. Atleast thats how I feel.

Well, you'd be hard-pressed to find a politician that hasn't lied. Supposing we find one, just give it time. All politicians lie, why are you acting like this is something new? However to say that he has never made any accomplishments while in office, I think is quite false. The real question seems to be whether his 2012 opponent will be an improvement or not.

maybe you are the one whose new here - there are things that make you lose points. if you can read, click on my (or anyone's) name and it will take you to their profile. For example I clicked on your name and you have 261 arguments (about 100 fewer than i have) and have been on CreateDebate just under 100 days and I joined more than 260 days ago.  I'm sure I've responded to you enough to prove I'm no puppet account. Now how 'bout you provide a better argument than Obama's name is close to Hitler's name (even though they are different lengths and don't have any letters in common) - and that somehow people should not like Obama because of it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics   Bailouts of behemoth companies = large scale loan consolidation.   one of the reasons for these behemoth companies, deregulation:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassâ€“Steagall_Act#Events_following_repeal   deregulation is a corollary to the 2008-2009 crises  also, I dont think were going to have to worry much about inflation:  http://inflationdata.com/inflation/ Inflation/AnnualInflation.asp#Commentary                                           Health care, en i have a feeling its not going to be nearly as bad as some people shout. I havn't seen any models which clearly and unbiasedly say its going to be good or bad but the specific things i hear about sound pretty good even though I generally hear "health care reform" is bad apparently... I could do more research on it, but i doubt it'll be necessary. Most of the bad things i hear about it deals with general categories, and rarely gets to details; its simply isn't convincing to tell me something, i need the reasoning behind it. when people talk about specifics they include details which give some of the reasoning, and the segments I hear sound good.  I'm not surprised by his performance.

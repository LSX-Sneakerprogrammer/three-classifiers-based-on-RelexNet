Things Bush did:  He got us into the unjustified trillion dollar war in Iraq that has left a million people dead.  He spent a lot of money while cutting taxes for the rich, thus exploding our debt.  He soured our relations with the rest of the world.  He allowed torture.  He completely blundered with regard to Katrina.  He worked to tear down the separation between church and state.  He fired United States Attorneys for political reasons.  Truly he was one of the greats!  But the real problem with Bush were the things he didn't do:  He didn't reform our financial system.  He didn't address global warming.  He didn't commit enough to Afghanistan.  He didn't address the rising income inequality in America.  He didn't address health care costs.  He failed to fix Social Security.  He resisted alternative energy.  He failed on immigration reform.  He never got bin Laden.  Other than that he was ok :)

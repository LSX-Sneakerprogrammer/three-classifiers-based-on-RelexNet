Would you not give him any credit for anything he has done so far?   Sure, he should be granted credit for instituting progress towards socialism.   Or are you against him 100%?   Correct.   Would you not also say that he entered the presidency in an extremely rough time?   Sure, to a certain degree. Only because of bad government policy.   he is not nearly as bad as the eight years that preceded him.   What was so bad about the last eight years besides the war?   I feel like he is trying to implement change, and do what he set out to do in the beginning of his campaign.   Doesn't mean that it is change for GOOD. He never said Change was going to be for the better.   I really see no president that is going to do a better job ( at least that has a chance of getting elected ) than Obama, unless you had someone in mind that had a hope of winning?   Ron Paul

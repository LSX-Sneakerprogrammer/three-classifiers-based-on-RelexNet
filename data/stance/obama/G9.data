Well if you're going to give Bush credit for things he  wanted  to do, then you have to give Obama credit for things he  wants  to do: Universal health care, clean energy research, financial reform, and closing Guantanamo :)  I'll give you the auto-bill thing, I had forgotten about that. But still, that was the bare minimum. Bush rejected the Kyoto protocol, which was the thing that mattered the most by far with respect to global warming.

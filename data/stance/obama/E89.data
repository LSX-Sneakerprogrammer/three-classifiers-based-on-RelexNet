Jesse didn't win because he was unqualified. sorry civil rights leader does not qualify for president.  i do believe the guy above you is an idiot for framing his statement the way he did. but hes correct, Ive spoke to many co workers/friends/neighbors/students in casual conversations and many told me yes, the like him and his politics but they would have voted for him because they wanted to see a black president represent them.

Yes he got elected for many reasons. He campaigned on lies...He made promises he did not keep and we are not a stupid people....we can see him today a different person. he wanted change....we got it. And the majority of the population do not support him any longer. We do not want same sex marriage, we do not want his health care package, we do not want his socialist ideals governing us. He was elected because he was half black. Millions of people voted color and had no idea what he was all about. We have many capable blacks in our country who had experience who would have made a great president....Obama was not the right person for the job. He duped and succeeded in convincing the country he was someone else. He still has not released his school or medical records....Why? He just now came forward with some new birth certificate....all of a sudden....why not back during the campaign? But people who voted for him did not care about his views.    http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=b5p3OB6roAg    This is hilarious and shows exactly how and why he got elected. This was only one segment of the population exposed.

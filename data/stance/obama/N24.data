My father served in World War II.  The Videos and the Facts    I have visited all 57 states.  Snopes   These are just clear misspeaks - certainly not lies.  He had been to  47  states and  His  Grandfather  (who raised him from age 10 on) did serve during World War II (and so did his great uncle)  ref   GWB said a lot of stupid things --  ref   ref   ref   ref   ref   ref   ref   ref  -- and they were just that - stupid things, not lies.

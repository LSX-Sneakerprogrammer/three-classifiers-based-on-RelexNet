Obama is doing fine. Hell, I'll vote for him in 2012. His election brought a lot of racists out of the woodwork which happens to include, (big surprise), the majority of the Republican Party. Obama isn't the next Hitler. If you think so then you've been listening to/watching to much Glenn Beck. I say GObama. (Go + Obama)

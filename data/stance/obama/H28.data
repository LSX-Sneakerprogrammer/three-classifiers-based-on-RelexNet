Time to annoy you.  poke   poke   poke   47 million people have had to live without health care in this country for the past 10 years, it fluctuating better or for worse over the years. Obama Care guarantees that ALL PEOPLE will have AFFORDABLE health care, BY THE LAW. The only bad part about his plan was that during the production of it, the Democrats had to scrap public option from the plan as a means of attempting to force the Republicans to cooperate. But they didn't, so they scraped public option.   But why should you give a holy hell? If you're an average person, you need health care; if you're a sick person, you need health care; and if you're a healthy person, you still need health care! Because of the health care reform, everyone, EVEN THE POOR AND HOMELESS, will receive all the health care they need.   As for the birth certificate... I cannot make this any more clear:  http://www.thedailybeast.com/ blogs-and-stories/2011-04-27/ obamas-birth-certificate-born-in- honolulu/#    His birth certificate is ON DISPLAY in Illinois, and has been since BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT. In fact, it's been on display since he was a Senator. Also, his birth is recorded in history; on the date of Barack Obama's birth, his name was listed in the daily newspaper of his birth-town in Hawaii.   So he's American... unless you don't consider Hawaiians to be Americans, but you'd should probably keep that opinion to yourself.  And if you start spouting crap about it all being forged, then I'm afraid you are a sorry sorry fool who only wants an excuse to be racist. Just because a man has a foreign name and a foreign parent doesn't make he himself foreign. In fact, I'll cross my fingers and hope our next President is named after a goddam Dungeon's and Dragon's character just to prove exactly how wrong it is to search for an excuse to keep an all American man out of the President's chair just because his name sounds funny.  Or because he's black.   Either way, you have no excuse to be into this ignorant Birther shit.   Good day.

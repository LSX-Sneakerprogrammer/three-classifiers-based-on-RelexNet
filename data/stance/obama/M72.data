The rest of your points are too stupid to be worth responding to.   Too Stupid eh? No you just don't want to start an argument with that is because you know you can be proven wrong.  In my post I AM mentioning PARTS of the bill, seems you are the stupid one.  Also, this debate is about Obama becoming president of '12, So I will add this:  Russia invaded Georgia, Obama was asked what his solution would be for that. He said: "We will have the UN vote on wither to take action or not..."  OK for ONE he is an idiot and I don't want an idiot being the leader of this country.  Why I say he is an idiot? Because he doesn't even know the system he supports, RUSSIA is on the UN board and it takes ONE Veto vote on the board to have something NOT done.  Explanation for this? Or is that just me being 'Stupid'?

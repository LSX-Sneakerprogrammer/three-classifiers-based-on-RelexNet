Federal regulation of health care should be limited and focused  For example, individuals who are continuously covered for a specified period of time should not be denied access to insurance because of pre-existing conditions.  individuals should be allowed to purchase insurance across state lines, free from costly state benefit requirements.  Finally, individuals and small businesses should be allowed to form purchasing pools to lower insurance costs and improve choice.  Regulation can correct common failures in insurance markets, but it is often counterproductive.  Regulation places a burden on good portions of the economy, not just bad portions.  Regulations function as a hidden tax. The federal government’s own Small Business Administration placing the price tag of regulation at $1.75 trillion annually—much higher than the entire burden of individual and corporate income taxes combined.  federal agencies today have near plenary power to issue whatever regulations they see fit. Though most are nominally controlled by the president, in actual practice agencies are frequently able to act autonomously with little or no presidential oversight. The end result is an economy subject to the whims of unaccountable bureaucrats pursuing their own agendas. A new regulation can suddenly transform a profitable investment into an unprofitable one or render employees unproductive. This produces uncertainty with all its attendant economic ills.  Just because we have the worst portions of the market, and the worst portions of socialism in American healthcare, does not mean we need to go towards more socialism... These countries that you hold up as models, are more efficient than ours, but they are going away from generous social programs, because they are going broke...  You point out that these other countries are more efficient, but Obamacare increases the paperwork, and decreases efficiency. How does Obamacare improve things?

I disagree with everything you said, but one thing truly stood out as grotesque and ignorant.    Glenn Beck, seriously?   What is your problem with Glenn Beck? I understand that his religion is insane, but so is yours. (I'm an Atheist.)  I mean, you have people like Rachel Maddow; she makes me want to cut my wrists while sitting in the middle of the desert with no liquids or food.   The issue with liberals is that they simply "check off/dismiss" people (like Glenn Beck) because they may have heard some propaganda on YouTube about how they're "hicks" and shit.  Do your research. Don't hate him because of his background.

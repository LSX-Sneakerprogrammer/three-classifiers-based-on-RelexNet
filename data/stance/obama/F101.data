{Then you must also admit republican policy is "very far from [ideal]."}  How can that be? This president has clearly proved he knows nothing of the economy or foreign policy for that matter.  {Jesus! How ignorant can you be? The presidency has exactly NO control over the gas prices.  I would suggest reading this.  Oil prices are a global phenomena. You have no point.}  NO control? Are you serious? We are sitting on 200 years of oil, do you really think that its cheaper to pay and drill in countries over 3000 miles away? NO, drilling here at home will cost LESS, which the president does have control over FYI, if the president can decide when go to congress (which obama had not for libya) to declare war or raise taxes then he can open oil reserves with no problem. I have a fine point. YOU have no point.  {$10 trillion. You have already discredited your argument.}  True, I am willing to accept when I am wrong.  {But why? Why is climbing? It's Obama isn't it. That nazi...always spending money.  Except it isn't Obama's policy. It's Bush's that is driving up the debt.  Almost all of our deficit can be attributed to four main spending binges:  1. Two unsustainable useless wars started, passed, and continued by republicans. It took Obama to end Iraq and create an endgame for Afghanistan pullout.  2. Two unsustainable, deficit exploding tax cuts for the rich. All passed, initiated, pushed, and signed by republicans.  3. An unsustainable social security increase. Take a guess as to who passed it?  4. An unsustainable Medicare Part D expansion, the single largest entitlement increase in United States history, and likely world history. Republicans sure are anti-entitlement small government fiscal conservatives aren't they...  -  But don't take my word for it. Here is Obama vs. Bush New Spending.  Obama is at a net $350 billion in non-recession spending (projected out for EIGHT years). Bush spent $4 trillion in the same time period.  Now look me in the eyes and call Obama a big spender.}  Ok I will,   1. Don't EVER call Iraq a stupid war, if you think going to search and destroy osama bin laden in Bush's war was stupid well your very undereducated. We didn't just roll into iraq with tanks for nothing, 9/11 triggered the war, If you can remember Republicans and democrats stood on the capitol with bush in and listened to the star spangled banner in agreement that war was absolutley necessary and then the democrats all ran away and blamed bush for the war. Democrats love to pay thanks to our shitty president for getting osama but what they dont realize this is BUSH'S WAR you all opposed and still do.  2. Do the poor create jobs? NO. Does the middle class, yea they contribute small business's but Steve Job's, Bill Gates, Alan Mulally, etc, the rich create the majority with jobs and what happens when you tax them to death, well they don't want to lose all the money of starting new corporations and new enterprises along with the taxes and regulations of the govt and they end up moving their business's to other countries where they can make a profit. Did you not read the part where 50% of Americans dont pay taxes and the rich make up for the 20% that do?! and you want to tax them more!?   3. Aren't the democrats the ones who want to spend money they don't have?  4. So theres 1 liberal thing a republican did, what if we added up all the shitty euro-style policies dems keep wanting to ram down the taxpayers throats? Look what each side spent it on, Bush's was the necessary war and obama's was his failed stimulus bill and obamacare that 60% of Americans want repealed TODAY?   {Who said liberals find it attractive?!?!?!  Liberals were AGAINST THE WARS!  AGAINST THE BUSH TAX CUTS.  Where have you been living. Why do you think they are calling on revenue increases? To cut the deficit that Bush created from a projected surplus}  Ok first of all, incorrect liberals were for the war in 2001 and then they backed out of it blaming it on bush in ...2001.5.  Why raise taxes, CUT USELESS SPENDING, for example funding the egyptian military when they we just had to pay 5 million dollars to release American hostages from egypt!?!? the should FUND THEIR OWN DAMN SELVES!  YES the righties wanted taxes for the poor, CAUSE THEY DONT PAY ANY! GENIUS!   What was there to think about? was it that hard to give the go ahead to kill osama? If it haden't been for this war you were all against we would have never got him!!!  I ask you, can you look me in the eyes and tell me obama isn't the biggest screw up next to jimmy carter?

At first, i saw Obama as a good choice. He seemed to know what he was talking about, and made some good proposals. What he failed to do however, was live up to those proposals. After claiming he was going to shut down Guantanamo Bay ( which contains potentially innocent people) years later, it is still open for business. I think this sheds light on the man, and proves that he is no more like the next man. Simply greedy for power.

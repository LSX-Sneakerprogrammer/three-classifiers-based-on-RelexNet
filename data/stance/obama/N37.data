obama got us 5.1 trillion dollars in dept already. Raised the tax on fuel and gave huge amounts of money to solar power manufactures. That are horrible at creating energy. And trying to make coal more expensive which are used in coal plants that make 50% of U.S power. Raising electricity prices. And obama lost 4 million jobs.   It would be insane to re elect him.

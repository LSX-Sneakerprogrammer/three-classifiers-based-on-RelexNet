No I don't believe they would be more tolerant than you. Which is why I do not care for religion or placing my faith into any particular one. I'm Agnostic, I'll consider anything but I won't commit to it until I have proof. Which I believe is the least intolerant and best religious stance to take. However I could be wrong, just as you could be, just a Muslim could be. I know this debate isn't about religion I just didn't like the negative tone you took at the possibility of someone having a different religion to you.

LOL I blame him more than anyone else, which is why I left him. That was over a decade ago. The progression was slow. Very slow. It was a series of very small incremental steps. The "one step over the line, it's hardly anything" lead to "one more step" leads to "one more step", and before you know it the line is so far back that you can't see your starting position any more.   He didn't start using pot because he wanted to be high. He started using it to fit in with a crowd of people. He was very susceptible to peer pressure. That's the reason he went on to other drugs. He continued to use pot after we moved to a different town, because by that time it was habitual. New place, new pressure to make friends, put him into contact with dealers who were selling more than just pot. And he so desperately wanted to be "friends" with his dealer. So yes, it was his fault, because if he hadn't been such a weak assed spineless wimp of a man he would have stuck by his guns. But if he'd been able to obtain marijuana over the counter, he wouldn't have needed that link to the dealer.

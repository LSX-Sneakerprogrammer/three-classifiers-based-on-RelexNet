Revolutions have happened and have been successful in the past, but honestly, who is going to support a revolution to legalize a drug like Pot to be used when it was banned for our protection? And don't even say "We revolted against the ban of alcohol." because it is quite obvious that Pot does far more damage to yourself and those around you than alcohol does. The fact that we can revolt against something doesn't mean we should. If we legalize something that makes people stop caring about their lives and only want to get "high" then we are pretty much setting a course for our downfall as a civilization.

Common sense does. Have you ever seen people do stupid things while under the influence of marijuana? Things they wouldn't have done otherwise? I have. But for the sake of argument lets say it doesn't cause any harmful mind altering effects (which I'm sure you'll argue next). Do you know of anyone who has been fired for marijuana use? There's a lot of companies that would fire people for that even if it wasn't illegal. When people don't have an income, they get desperate, especially when they want more money for their next fix. Desperate people do desperate (and often illegal) things.

Marijuana has huge amounts of byproducts which can be valuable to the community. Its medicinal properties are well known and studied. It would provide jobs across the country, provide hemp crops for textile use, and would provide large amounts of tourism revenue from potheads worldwide.  It provides an extra source of taxation for the government (they can tax pot as heavily as they do with cigarettes).   It also removes a major gateway to other more dangerous illegal substances.  Pot is possible to saliva test roadside, thus providing another area for the government to pull revenue from (drug driving).  It also frees up police officers who are busy chasing minor users, and enables them to go after more serious criminals.

But what about people that want to practice S&M;? Should they not e allowed to? What about a senior citizens that don't have much time to live, should they be denied one more experience? And in order to do studies on marijuana, doesn't some one has to smoke it and allow himself to be studied?  BTW, do you know of any pot smoking studies looking for volunteers ;)

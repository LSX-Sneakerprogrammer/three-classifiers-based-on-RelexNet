The reasons for why pot should be legalized are all legitamite but people are only looking at the big picture. Sure it can benifet society in many ways but their are so many down sides to legalizing pot. If everyone were to become pot attics they would become more and more addicting up to the point that all they want to do is smoke pot. Allot of people are probably reading this and thinking that i am completly wrong, but the fact of the matter is that if you smoke pot long enough your mind will strictly be wrapped around trying to get high. With that said, how will our society progress if every has their minds on obtaining pot. Our world will not become more advanced because everyone who was one smart is now a pot head! Who will be the guy to cure cancer if everyone is on pot??

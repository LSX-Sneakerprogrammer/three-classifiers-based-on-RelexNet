Marijuana fuels an apathy that is anything but what the US needs right now. Legalizing it would just put lots of new addicts on the streets, smoking up and dropping out of school. It starts people down the path to harder drug use. Billions of dollars go towards terrorist organizations through the marijuana trade, and they would get even more as people went experimenting from pot to cocaine and heroin.

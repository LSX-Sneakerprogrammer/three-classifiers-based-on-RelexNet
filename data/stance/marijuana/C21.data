About uninformed I am not exactly agree. Around the world   everybody knows about disaster. I think it was mistake to legalize an alcohol in the beginning. And what is the result? We can see only how young people are in disaster and how they lose their life potential. Just I am afraid to imagine if people will able to use marijuana. Maybe it will be better legolize everything ...We must think about future but with legalizing our future will be void....unfortunately

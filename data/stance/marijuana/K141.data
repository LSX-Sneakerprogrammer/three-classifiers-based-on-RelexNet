How could you be so ignorant to do drugs anyways? The one thing that a drug targets is the brain, it alters and cripples every thought, it kills people, it depresses them, and marijuana fits in all of those positions. And drug users do this for social mobility? Comfort? And isolation? It seems very pointless to me, and it will affect everyone around you because anyone can be a victim. I support to end drugs.

I know so many successful people that have smoked or still smoke pot on occasion and have never used anything else. If you look at the history on how it got classified as a hardcore substance it all politically motivated and a bunch of BS. Marijuana has so many benefits for sick people and also it's building material which is grows in only a few months. I'm tired of hearing about nice people who are doing 10 years to life just for weed. You know me I don't smoke it but I think that it's all about personal freedoms who's right is it to tell you what you put in your body. The other drugs such as cocaine and heroin those need to stay as such.

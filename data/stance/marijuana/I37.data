yes, for one simple reason.   free country. if people wanna fuck up their lives with drugs, let them. hell, maybe they won't die or lose their job. the point is, not our fuckin' business on how someone decides to take the edge off.  making drugs an illegal business just gets more people killed anyway. imagine what would happen to the drug lords if corporations took over the drug market.  basically: "got a problem? fix it with capitalism"

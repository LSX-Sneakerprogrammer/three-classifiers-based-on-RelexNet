Do not be fooled by the multi-party politricks system which is often tied to selfish gain and short term ends. Which like the ancient kingdom of babylon seeks to impose its views by force at the expense of the majority to benefit the minority. Many of those in position of power to regulate laws are often helped along the way financially by the fat pockets of alcohol and tobacco lobbyists, whose industry continues to thrive because of their economic dominance which is being used to suppress the tree of life (marijuana), which if became legal would affect the corruption drastically on alcohol and tobacco which have been proven by medical research to pose a far greater threat to the health and well being of the population in comparison to the the healing herb of cannabis. So no I will not drink the cup of devils, but will continue to partake of the healing herb of marijuana which makes life pleasant even in the most trying conditions, for the life experience itself has manifested my legal right protected through the Charter of the United Nations which upholds the noblest aspirations of man without any distinction of race, sex , language and religion. My right is my right, just as a man has a right to drink wine or beer, which consequently is often brewed with Humulus lupulus (the hop plant) which only it and cannabis are of the same herbaceous plant group of Cannabaceae.   'Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise' Proverbs 20:1  "Since in the scale of creation all men are born equal, it is imperitive that all laws should be equitable in their application, for what is the foundation of freedom and the reasons that men cherish it, if they are not equal before the law. The answer is clear to all of you." HIM Haile Selassie I

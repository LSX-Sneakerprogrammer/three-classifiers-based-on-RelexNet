Then by your logic, alcohol and tobacco should also be illegal, right?  Because right now in the U.S., those two substances ARE legal to purchase in ANY AMOUNT, from almost any place.  So the question is, since marijuana IS less harmfull to the mind and body than both alcohol and tobacco, WHY are those who use it recreationally, denied to make that choice?

I hate you people.  Weed is a bad substance, just as bad as alcohol, its banned now, unbanning it will just give people another excuse to bitch at the government and allow a gateway for advocates of drugs to try to get other drugs legalized, like steroids.  Yadda yadda yadda. The legalization of pot isn't just a small matter, it's a beacon for trouble from other substances.

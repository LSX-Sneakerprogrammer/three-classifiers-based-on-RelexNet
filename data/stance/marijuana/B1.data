I think that this whole issu3 is ridiculous. It should not even be question3d weither or not marijuana is leg@l it just should be. Yes marijuana is harmfull to you but so is alot of things that are legal. NUmber one standing fact is that alcohol alone has been charted to have claimed 100,00 lives a year and is still legalized and where are the statistics of marijuana related deaths... but besides that if im not mistakein (correct me if im wrong) but marijuana now has been decriminalized by the government an now lies in the hands of the individual states ..so come on people sell the weed not the seeds u can still make profit .. w3ll imma end it there but If u dont Agr33 u have Obviously never smok3ed before BUT..just try one time you wont b3 a hypocrite just think of yourself as an experimentalist if u still dont agree u aint smokin the right shiiT .. :D

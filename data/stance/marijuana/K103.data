The war on drugs is as useless and money-consuming as the war on terror, simply because you will NEVER eliminate either of the two. There will always be drugs and there will always be terrorists. I'm all for legalizing weed. Not only would it be better for the economy, but look at Amsterdam - weed is legal over there and you never hear anything out of them. They've been onto something for a long time now. :)

Use facts to back up your argument, not useless speculation. "According to a federal Institute of Medicine study in 1999, fewer than 10 percent of those who try marijuana ever meet the clinical criteria for dependence, while 32% of tobacco users and 15% of alcohol users do" (http://www.drugpolicy.org/facts/ drug-facts/marijuana-facts).  So if you got "addicted" to marijuana, it's because you're a wimp looking for attention. "A study at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada proves that marijuana actually stimulates brain cell growth" (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/ 2005/10/051016083817.htm).  Again, marijuana ENHANCES both sides of the brain "by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system" (http://deanna-roddy.suite101.com/ the-pros-and-cons-of-marijuana-use-is-i t-a-safer-alternative-a241045).  Furthermore, a study conducted in America (http://beforeitsnews. com/story/1530/375/ Study:_Smoking_Marijuana_Improves_ Driving_Skills.html)  showed "the use of medical marijuana has caused traffic related fatalities to fall by nearly nine percent in states that have legalized medical marijuana." So get your facts straight before you talk shit. :)

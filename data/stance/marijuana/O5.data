Marijuana seems to be opposed purely on an indoctrinational basis.   Because it is relatively harmless, because it does not cause hysteria or murder or other horrible effects, the only reason sane people would so strongly desire to outlaw a plant is because they were taught from an early age that this plant is horrible and illegal.  Nearly everyone opposed to it has never tried it more than once. It is well known that not everyone feels the effects of it the first time, so when they say "It doesn't work", and they continue to agree with the government, it only hurts people who do enjoy using it.  If it was harmful, then why do so many intelligent people use it? The founding fathers grew it, and everyone knows about Carl Sagan.  Steve Jobs, Bill Gates.   And even if it was harmful, how can anyone tell me what I can and can't put into my own body? If I was a child, I would understand, but I think I can research this stuff on my own well enough to understand what marijuana is and then consume it without guidance.  If the government wants to interfere in my life, then I would like a massive research grant so I can do science and hopefully improve the world for everyone.

No, I have seen people do stupid things under the influence of marijuana, like attempting to drive a car while blazed out of their minds.   Do you support a ban on Alcohol?   I am only trying to demonstrate a principle, not suggesting we illegalize everything that causes people to lose jobs.   Well, the principal you are trying to demonstrate doesn't help your argument, when other invalid conclusions can be drawn from the same line of reasoning.   "According to the 2008 NSDUH, marijuana accounted for 4.2 million of the estimated 7 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs. In 2008, approximately 15 percent of people entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse; 61 percent of persons under 15 reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse, as did 56 percent of those 15 to 19 years old." -National Institute of Drug Abuse  About 9% of frequent marijuana users will develop a dependency. That's a lot of people if you open it up to the whole nation.   I would really like to know what this article defines as "dependency" because I happen to know that marijuana does not produce withdraw when it's use is ceased.  In the broad sense almost anything can be addicting, or abused. I could abuse Tylenol, but that does not mean it is inherently addictive. So please define your terms here.   Rather what I am saying is that it is only common sense that it can be a contributor to crime.   If Soda was illegal, then drinking Soda would be a contributor to crime. It's only "contributing to crime" because it's illegal.   It most certainly does. There have been many deaths directly linked to marijuana use. Car crashes are a common way in which people under the influence of marijuana harm themselves, and others.   Legalizing marijuana does not necessitate repealing "driving under the influence" laws. Driving while high, would still be illegal, but recreational use in the privacy of one's own home should not be illegal.

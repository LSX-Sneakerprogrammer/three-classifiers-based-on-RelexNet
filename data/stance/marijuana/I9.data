Face it, the real reason pot is illegal is so 1) cops have increased ability to harass minorities and lower class people, and 2) profits from alcohol and pharmacy are artifically protected. These reasons do not justify the loss of freedom of millions of Americans.   1 out of 3 Americans have tried marijuana (and that's just those who will admit it.) Should we really imprison a third of the country?

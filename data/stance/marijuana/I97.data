You fail to show what marijuana supposedly "does to people". There are few ill effects, even among the heaviest long-term smokers. But heavy, long-term repetition of most activities will have negative results (running, for example).  You also appear to be claiming that marijuana use is somehow a threat to domestic peace. You also seem to think it will magically develop addictive properties once its legal.  You fail to show why the law should be invasive enough to regulate what you put in your own body, or why the law should be used to legislate away things you don't like. Governments allow industry to put all kinds of toxins and waste into our food, air, and water, and the government gets paid to allow it, and all the citizens are forced to ingest it. No reason we shouldn't all have the right to knowingly poison ourselves.  Also, your argument seems to assume that many people would suddenly begin using marijuana who are not already, and there's no data to prove this. People are already spending their pot budgets, nothing would change there (except maybe they could grow it and save).  Your entire view of government is rather disturbing. "The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace." Citizen-control is  not  a constitutional principle, in fact our rights insulate us from overt control by the government.

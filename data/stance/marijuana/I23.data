Marijuana being illegal is part of the reason why people do it. It is a stupid reason, but a reason nonetheless. Legalizing marijuana, could potentially lower the number of users. The thrill of the chance of being caught gives them a high that's intensified by the drug. It outta just be legalized, and the government can tax the hell out of it like with cigarettes. It's your choice if you're going to do it or not.

Popular sovreignity is the cornerstone of democracy. Purely on the grounds of this, the overwhelming public support for the legalisation of marijuana, should it be legalised. A question of legality should be totally devoid of any of the the potential benefits or problems since our political system is not based upon paternal justifications.  This aside, the overwhelming benefits to society is enough even for a clearly paternal government to legalise. Even though these have already been stated, I will reiterate: the economic savings of such legalisation alongside the proven fall in consumption (note statistics from Portugal's decriminalisation) provides a clear justification if this government did have our best interests at heart.

Marijuana is a drug that can lead to other drugs. Not for everyone, but it does afford everyone the opportunity to find other drugs. Legalized marijuana would continue the downfall of our society in the United States. There are many people who don't smoke pot because it is illegal. These same people would totally deplete the nations supply of potato chips and ice cream. Madness.

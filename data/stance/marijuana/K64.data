I generally support the legalization of marijuana, which is really just another plant so whats the big deal. But I probably wouldn't want to tax it. At least not much. Cuz then how are people gonna afford snacks for the munchies right? But seriously, taxation is good to convince govt to legalize it, although its actually onerous to add more taxes, so if it is done, it should be done as little as possible.

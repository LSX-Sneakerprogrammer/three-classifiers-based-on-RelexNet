I agree. I hate how their's so many shows nowadays about how pot should be legalized or how theirs shows that show the medical pot stores in california and how pople hold rallies and riot to try and get pot legalized. I have smoked pot atleast 150+ times in my life(i haven't smoked pot in atleast 7+ months, and have only smoked it 4 times in the last 4 years), so i know what it's like to be high, and the only way i could see someone thinking that marijuanna is a medicine would be if your high when you say that. Their is no way that marijuanna could be a medicine. I hated the feeling of being high, and if you look up Cannabis and mental disorders, then you'll find that cannabis does more harm to you than good(the only reason people say it's good is because it numbs them and makes the pain go away).    I personally think that if they legalize it, then The United States will sooner or later fall apart.

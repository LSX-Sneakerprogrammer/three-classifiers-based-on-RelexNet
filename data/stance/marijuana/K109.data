I can't argue your personal experiences, so I won't. I missed your link, sorry about that.   Your link provides no specific references to studies or specific scientific data. It simply makes statements. For example:  "Although it has yet to be proven conclusively that heavy marijuana use can cause irreversible loss of intellectual capacity, animal studies have shown marijuana-induced structural damage to portions of the brain essential to memory and learning. "  And even within those statements, nothing is conclusive. You'd think after all this time at least SOMETHING would be conclusive, no? Here's some conclusive evidence on a legal substance, Alchol:   http://www.uleth.ca/alcohol/ affects2.html    "Serious disease of the liver and pancreas, and damage to the stomach and intestines can result from excessive use of alcohol. "  By the way, I hold a perscription, grow my own stuff (legally, mind you, and it never ends up anywhere outside my home), and when I don't have my own I have very trusted friends who grow it. In addition to that, there are many trustworthy dispensaries (essentially a pot store with a menu, etc.) here in California that I can safely get access to clean medicine.

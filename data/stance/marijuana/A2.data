I used to think no. I was naive. Marijuana is not a super dangerous drug. Don't argue that it's not bad for you at all, because most things are bad for you to some degree, especially when they are chemicals and drugs that you enter into your system to change your feeling. But I think cigarettes are worse than pot: they're more addicting, worse for you, and cheaper and  legal ! If cigarettes can be legal, so should pot.

"I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions"   Once again you have nothing but speculation to back that up. This didn't happen with prohibition of alcohol and it didn't happen when Amsterdam legalized marijuana and it didn't happen when Portugal decriminalized all drugs.   "don't say it's not addicting. I know people that are addicted"   I will say it isn't addictive because it is not physically addictive. I don't care how much anecdotal evidence you have, it has been proven to not be physically addictive. While cigarettes and alcohol are incredibly addictive, yet you seem to be okay with them.   "Worst case scenario, half the population would go out and buy it, get high and wreak havoc on America."   You are completely making that proportion up. It is based on absolutely no evidence. You would be just a justified if you literally picked a random number because that is basically what you did.  And what havoc do you think people wreak on America that do it now. Once again as you failed to acknowledge marijuana does not cause reckless and uncontrollable actions like alcohol does. Yet once again I doubt you support the prohibition of alcohol.   "Productivity would go down"   And again another statement based totally on social stigma and no actual evidence.  I challenge you to cite one negative result of legalizing marijuana that does not apply to alcohol or cigarettes that you actually have a shred of evidence. I really don't think you can come up with a single one. If you can, prove me wrong. Once again it cannot also apply to alcohol or cigarettes and must be have evidence. Don't speculate or provide anecdotal evidence.

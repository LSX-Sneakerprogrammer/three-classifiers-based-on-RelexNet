Does anybody know how much the American economy would grow if Marijuana was legalized? Listen, it's not the government's problem if people are irresponsible and mess up their lives with Marijuana, right? The government would make an enormous amount of many off of all the Marijuana sales, and we would be on our way back up, and I sincerely hope that President Obama decides to legalize it once he takes care of the war. (By the way, I still can't get over the fact that I can call him President Obama now. Yes!)

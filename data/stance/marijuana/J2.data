Thank you for being open minded Jake. But I have to disagree with you on the fact that you think it will not do wonders for the economy. With the legaliztion of Cannabis would most certainly come the legaliztion to grow and manufacture Hemp products. Hemp can be used for virutally anything and the industry would explode over night. You have to remember that legaliztion would effect multiple markets.

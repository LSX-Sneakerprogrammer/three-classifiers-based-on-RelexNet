I don't like drugs, and I'd rather they didn't exist, period. But that's not the case. On the argument of prison overcrowding due to illegal drug users, they may as well legalize it and reduce the crowding. However, legalizing it will give too much leeway for people to get their hands on it even more. It's overall bad for society, but whether it's legal or illegal, it has its upsides and downsides alike. On the other hand, I'm absolutely not looking forward to smelling marijuana everywhere I go, that is, if it was legalized. It is so awful and obvious smelling.

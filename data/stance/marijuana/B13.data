Yes, those who smoke weed should be able to smoke in the smoking section in restaurants the same as cigarette smokers because weed or cigarettes are both drugs along with it's cousin alcohol. Both have a disgusting odor. 450,000 people die to cigarette causes a year while 0 have died from weed causes ever.  What is your fundamental reason to keep weed illegal? None of the reasons are any more than those of cigarettes or alcohol.

Geez, you're a true idiot. For one thing, I have a college degree, two professional licenses, make over $80,000/year, and I enjoy MJ. I have many friends that are the same. Oh yeah, and some of them are Republicans. So next time, try some facts, not just what you learn from your ma and pa in the trailer park.

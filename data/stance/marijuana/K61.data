weed should be legal.  it's the safest "drug" there is and it's ridiculous that alcohol and cigarettes are legal and killing people while marijuana is illegal and hasn't killed anyone.  plus it doesn't have any serious side effects, just makes you more relaxed and sometimes you think about things that never cross your mind while sober. i think the government has no right to dictate the way we live our life and what we do in our spare time as long as we're not hurting others or vandalizing property.  there's many other reasons why i think it should be legal, this is just a few of them.

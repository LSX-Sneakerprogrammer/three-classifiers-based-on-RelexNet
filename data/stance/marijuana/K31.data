"If you want to smoke weed, don't make the argument for decriminalization."  -WHAT? WHY? Any step towards legal weed is a good one.  Both decriminalization and legalization both have many numbers that show it's beneficial effects on society. Oh, and if you didn't notice, legalization DOES decriminalize it. They are not mutually exclusive.  And yes, many people want to get high on cannabis. That's why we're here. If you can come up with a good reason why that should be illegal, I'm all ears. So far, I haven't heard anything. People using drugs is not bad, we do it all the time (caffeine, Tylenol, Vicoden). People using dangerous drugs is bad. If you can prove that pot is dangerous to society, I'm all ears. No one has been able to do so. Ever.

1. Weed is not physiologically addictive, as opposed to say..tobacco  2. You can't OD on weed like you can with alcohol - you have to eat like four pounds of it or something.  3. It has little to no long term negative effects (decreases in short term memory + attention span for people smoking once a day for like 30 years)  4. Although Obama recently dismissed the idea, weed would be good for the economy - You tax it, people buy it, the government makes bank.   5. Weed helps you think in new ways. What's wrong with that?  6. Mexico is imploding right now because of drug cartels whose main cash crop is weed.  One of the best arguments I've heard made is that weed is no worse than alcohol or tobacco. No matter what else, if that's true, then there is no reason for weed not to also be legal.   Sure people can become psychologically addicted to weed, but they can get addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, gambling just as easily. All of which are already legal.

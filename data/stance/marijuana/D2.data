I think marijuana should be legalized for various reasons.   First of all, let me make it clear that I currently do not consume marijuana. I used to as a teenager but stopped due to the fact that it is illegal. But I am still in favor of its recreational use because, in my opinion, it is not as dangerous as other already legal substances (tobacco, alcohol). I mean, hey! If these substances are legal, why can't marijuana be as well? It doesn't cause a strong physical addiction like other substances, it doesn't induce violent behavior, it awakens creativity, it's completely natural, etc.   Another point is that I think the legalization of marijuana could put an end to the harmful effects of illegal trafficking. The war between drug cartels and police have caused way too many deaths worldwide. We have already seen the effects of prohibition on alcohol. When prohibition was lifted, there was less violence on the streets due to the fact that the trafficking stopped. Why can't we do the same with the trafficking situation between Mexico and the US?  I also think that the legalization of marijuana would be good for the economy. It would create a new work industry therefore more jobs available to the people. Like tobacco, it could be heavily taxed and provide more money for the Federal Reserve (I'm not sure that is a good thing).  So, there's my argument. Anyone beg to differ?

Effectiveness of the War On Drugs:  "Police arrested an estimated 872,720 persons for cannabis violations in 2007, the highest annual total ever recorded in the United States, according to statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Of those charged with cannabis violations, approximately 89 percent, 775,137 Americans were charged with possession only. An American is now arrested for violating cannabis laws every 38 seconds. "  -Obviously, from this you can see that it's completely failing: the American people want to smoke pot and there's nothing that can be done about it.  Cost:  "Since December 31, 1995, the U.S. prison population has grown an average of 43,266 inmates per year. About 25 per cent are sentenced for drug law violations. " -Many of these people's lives were completely ruined by incarceration.  "The U.S. federal government spent over $19 billion dollars in 2003 on the War on Drugs, at a rate of about $600 per second. The budget has since been increased by over a billion dollars. " - All these tax dollars spent in attempt to prevent something that's never going away and millions of hard working American citizens enjoy.  So the war on drugs is completely un-effective and also extremely costly in terms of human life, happiness, and finances.

Also, read the government's findings on marijuana here:  http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ marijuana.html    Keep in mind most of everything that is said in this report uses words such as "may" and "could" because nothing, as of now, is conclusive. This is in spite of the fact that we as humans have been using it for thousands of years. My feeling on this is that if marijuana actually is dangerous....then not only would we know it from hearing about it, but these studies would have conclusive, definitive results. Not wishy-washy, half-assed results. Also: you won't find anything in that report that is worse than existing legal substances and pharmacueticals (think vicoden, lithium, valuum, morphein, wel butron, etc.).  So...what the hell? Why are we having a war on pot?   Results of ending the war on drugs: no more tax money being spent, millions of Americans' lives will be instantly better as they will not be incarcerated, etc. A new industry will be created that will provide tax revenue, jobs, etc. A small number (comparatively) of government workers would lose their jobs.  Results of not ending the war on drugs: DEA agents, etc. and others will not lose their jobs. Politicians will continue to have something to be proud of and market themselves with. People will continue to use drugs anyway, as history has shown and nothing will change as it is now and has been since it was made illegal.  An alternative to the war on drugs? We need to shift our thinking from drug addict, CRIMINALS to drug addict, PATIENTS. Meaning these people need help, not jail. There's a reason they are taking the drug - lets solve the problem with using therapy, clinics, raising awareness, and educating people so that they can make their own healthy decisions. No one is saying there isn't a problem, but there are many that say (and I agree) that we're going about this problem all wrong.

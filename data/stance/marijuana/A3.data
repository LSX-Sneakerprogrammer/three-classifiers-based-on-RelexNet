Marijuana is no more harmful than tobacco or alcohol, if taken in moderate quantities. Tobacco and alcohol are both legal and widely used in the US, regulated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If the abuse of marijuana is harmful, isn't the abuse of tobacco or alcohol equally life threatening? Would you want the government to limit how much alcohol or tobacco you take?

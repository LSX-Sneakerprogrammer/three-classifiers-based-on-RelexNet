At the end of your "essay" you act as though it was good to legalize alcohol in the first place. Just because something is legal now doesn't mean that it should have been in the first place, and second, i think that marijuanna shouldn't be legalized is because(no matter what potheads say) their has been research done on the effects of smoking Cannabis, and the results were not good. Just go on google and type in something like "Cannabis and mental disorders" or something like that, and you'll find a ton of sites that show the research that Cannabis is bad for your brain. Have you ever noticed that the only people who want to legalize pot are people who smoke it themselves, or are related to someone who does. All i have to say is that science(research) will have the final say into whether or not it's bad for you.

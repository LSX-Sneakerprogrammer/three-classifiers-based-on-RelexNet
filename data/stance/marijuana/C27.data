1. We can spend less taxpayer money on the War On Drugs, and gain revenue from taxation.  2. People would be much less likely to ingest marijuana that is laced with something dangerous if the product was regulated to standards.   3. Job growth by legalizing an already large industry (more taxation revenue).  4. To many, it seems hypocritical to keep marijuana illegal while tobacco and alcohol can be purchased legally.   5. It would be easier to get correct data on numbers and locations of users, to get better data for overall effects of heavy or long-term use, and people would be more likely to seek help if they use too heavily.

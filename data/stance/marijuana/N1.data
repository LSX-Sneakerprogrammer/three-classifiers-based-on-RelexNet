First of all, legalization of marijuana will be beneficial for government in many ways. The government spends a huge amount of money to fight drugs, although these costs looks not so effective with the drug marijuana, because it is widely used, and in my opinion probably marijuana is no more harmful than currently legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol. In a recent study for the Fraser Institute, Economist Stephen T. Easton, it was calculated how much tax revenue the Canadian government could gain by legalizing marijuana. So, the study estimates that the average price of 0.5 grams (a unit) of marijuana sold for $8.60 on the street, while its cost of production was only $1.70. If government legalize marijuana the price for it will fall because it will have become readily available + the government will get taxes.

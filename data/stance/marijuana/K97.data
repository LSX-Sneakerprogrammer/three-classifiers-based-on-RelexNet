There is absolutly nothing wrong with smoking marijuana! in fact there are many more fatality or deaths using alchool every year. Make pot legal, tax it, and put rules and regulations along with it just as they did with alchool! Years ago alchool was illegal and bootleggers were dealing all over the world and if caught you would spend time in jail! Nowdays this is true with pot and we are filiing up the jails with drugdealers petty pot charges and theres no room for the real criminals such as the rappist and murderers!

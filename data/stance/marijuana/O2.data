In reality   Or whatever passes for reality in your mind.   Marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol   Can you provide any evidence? You see, I can provide a lot to indicate otherwise. Alcohol kills, according to NORML, around 85,000 people a year! Tobacco kills 435,000 people each year! Then we come down to good ol' Mary Jane, and she isn't responsible for a single death.   Marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug   Marijuana has been proven to not be a gateway drug.   into crack cocaine, heroin    Nope    opium   WHO THE HELL DOES OPIUM ANY MORE?!?   It is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high, not until relaxed.    Depends on the user. I've known people who smoked until they greened out, but others only take a toke or two to relax.   When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional.    This is based purely on personal observation, but I'd say that one is more functional when high, but functional in a different manner.   Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed   Yet it still is more damaging to the body than weed!   Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco   Depends on how much you smoke. All day every day, probably; but most people aren't like that.   however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does   You hear about drunk driving all the time, but I've never heard of a case where the only intoxicant involved was ganja.   Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain.   Willing to provide evidence for this?   Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected.   As somebody who actually smokes pot occasionally, I disagree with this.   With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run.   That just sounds plain ridiculous!   Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues   Slow down?! Cheeba saves lives!   it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue.   Depends on the issue, I should imagine. It helps people going through chemo to eat, which is pretty damn useful if you want to, you know, LIVE.   Same goes with prescription medicine.   Compare the negative side effects of, say, just about any prescription medicine with the negative side effects of sensimilla. I dare you.   The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it.   The reason prescription medicines are legal is because politicians, doctors, and those involved with Big Pharma make shitloads of money from their legality.   I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case   Fortunately. Herb should be used because of its benefits to all, not just the sick.   Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults.   As well as many adults. Most people, once again in my experience, do not abuse it. Most people use it recreationally, and it does less harm than good.   There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill.   Too many trillions wasted on finding and incarcerating those non-violent users of drugs?   The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.    Mull use is goin' down!

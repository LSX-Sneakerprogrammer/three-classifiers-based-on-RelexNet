"I highly doubt marijuana would spark a billion dollar industry. There would still be a lot of private growers to circumvent the taxes on it and to make it cheaper. I'd say the same for cigarettes, but tobacco is not the only thing in there. It's a precise mixture of dozens of substances and chemicals, so people can't exactly manufacture that on their own."  People don't just smoke marijuana. it can be made into a variety of things for very cheap. It has long been speculated that if it were legal it would rock textile industry to it's core. Hemp used to be used for making rope and paper, the constitution in fact is written on hemp, but not anymore. It has even been suggested that the textiles industry is in on keeping the drug war going just to protect their market. So, your argument is completely wrong, because of it's many uses and how easy it is to grow (we are talking about weed here, it often grows in spite of efforts to stop it) marijuana would most certainly become a muliti billion dollar industry if legalized.

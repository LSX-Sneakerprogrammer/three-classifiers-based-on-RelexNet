Where is the hard data that backs your claims of #1, 2, & 3. People cite your reasons as a strong arguement for keeping marijuana legal, but there is flaws in that.  #1 - There is no data that specifically proves that marijuana causes people to experiment with harder drugs. This argument is subjective to individual experince; therefore it cannot be used to support the prohibition of marijuana because there is more smokers who have not tried harder drugs than there is smokers who have. #2 - This claim never existed until after 9-11 happened and governmental scare tactics used on the population to further it's own agenda. If anyone knows drugs and their nature, they'd know that marijuana money is chump change to harder, more expensive drugs. If a terrorist organization were to make money from the export of illegal drugs, they are more likely to sell cocaine, heroin, and/or MDMA (Ecstasy). Therefore, the likeliness of marijuana being a major source of income for terrorist organizations is very low. #3 - Is connected to #1 and therefore, is invalid.

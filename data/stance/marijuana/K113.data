Actually buddy if you look at the statistics and scientific evidence, Marijuana while not completely harmless, is MUCH MUCH MUCH less harmful than any other substance used for similar effects... whether it be to get high or for medicinal uses. Also there is no convincing scientific evidence that marijuana causes psychological damage or mental illness in either teenagers or adults.

Actualy Drugs dont do this... Prohibition creats a black market for drugs... If they were legal and the government focused on harm reduction, there would be less of a problem. Look at the netherlands... Drugs have been legal for a quite a while now and results have been nothing but successful. Oh and if you want a more American example... look at alcohol prohibition...

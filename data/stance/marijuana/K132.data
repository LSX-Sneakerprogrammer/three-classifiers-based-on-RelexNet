"I completely disagree with this statement and it goes against any scientific proof. Studies have been done that prove if you take breaks and have more leisure time you are a much more effective worker. Now obviously if you are neglecting your responsibilities leisure is bad."   I want to see these studies. There are a lot of jobs that require people to stay active for long periods of time, I don't see them handing out weed and duritos and telling people to take an enjoyable break. Look at book camp as an example. Sure it's tough, but what isn't that you're trying to do well.   "In your next response you talk about how you morally think doing things that are unproductive or enjoyable are wrong. I have several problems with this.  First off, honestly I'm not you and neither is anyone else why should we have to be held accountable to your unreasonable and arbitrary morals.    I said also said ethics.    "Second off if we never did stop working productivity would fall because everyone would be unhappy. Unhappy people are not productive. Society would not operate like this so it is unreasonable to expect people to operate without leisure time."   This is hilarious. You decline to recognize any validity in my morals or even that I mentioned ethics as well, but holy shit, it's so important to me that you're unhappy without your substance...    "If you are going to tell people whether they can or cannot use substances such as Cannabis; than at least have a better reason than your supposed morals that almost half the country disagrees with. You admit to being hypocritical about your no-leisure rule by being on the internet rather than doing something productive and who is to say that is all your hypocritical about. So even you don't follow your own ethics/morals."   I am being hypocritical, but that's not the point. Leisure doesn't require marijuana, or any other drug. Contributing an argument is anything but leisure.   "But that is besides the point, as a completely productive citizen who works full time and goes to school full time, why do I have to go through illegal channels to enjoy a healthier substance (Cannabis) than a legal substance (Alcohol) in my spare time. Decriminalization is not enough. The game is over, we know that Cannabis is no worse and possibly better than Alcohol and denying people the right to a trustworthy and accountable Cannabis industry is authoritarian at best."*   You have this idea, that by doing what is expected of you by todays society, that you're doing good.

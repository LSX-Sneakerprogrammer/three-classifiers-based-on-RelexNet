There is no valid comparison to be drawn between cocaine and marijuana. Marijuana is not addictive, it doesn't cause cancer, you cannot overdose on it, and it doesn't make you any more likely to commit other crimes.   The only way it could be dangerous is if you drive under it's influence. Which is no different than most any prescription drug.  I've not seen a single convincing argument for why Marijuana should be illegal.

Ahhh, yes. Of course everyone who does weed will do other drugs. Clearly you don't know anyone who smokes weed and your just reciting the DARE propaganda they told you. If something harmless like weed can lead to something dangerous like meth, than drinking milk leads to vodka. Not everyone who smokes weed is stupid enough to try any other drug. And you don't build up tolerance and NEED something. I know tons of people who smoke everyday and get better grades than non smokers, haven't tried any other drugs, and are less zombie like than someone spouting out propaganda someone told to them.   And btw, all my friends who smoke are usually A LOT more interesting than people who don't.

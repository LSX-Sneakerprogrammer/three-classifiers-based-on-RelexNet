When was the last time pot was illegal in Amsterdam? They've never had to deal with an initial burst of pot smokers. And although it may be an assumption, I know quite a few people who would like to smoke pot, but don't want to because of the law. And I even know some people who have smoked it, but have tried not to do it too much because of the law.

I support legalizing marijuana, because those countries that have marijuana legal have less problems with schedule 1 drugs. What happens in the US is that those who do smoke marijuana get caught with it and get put on probation. While they are on probation that start using Schedule 1 drugs like Cocaine, which exits your system in no more than 72hrs. This is why marijuana is a gateway drug. For those who do not smoke marijuana, I don't think that making it legal would make much of a difference. Marijuana is like cigarettes being so easy to come by that if you wanted to smoke it you would go get you some. By legalizing marijuana maybe some of our tax money used to keep those in prison for having marijuana could go towards something better, like education.

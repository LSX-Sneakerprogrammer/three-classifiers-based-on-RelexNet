i agree. Cannabis isn't 100% legal in any country in the whole world(for anyone who doesn't believe this, look it up(yes, it isn't legal in Amsterdam or Jamaica like people believe)). Since it isn't legal in any country in the whole world, then if we legalize it, all the gangs who sell cannabis will move to the United States, because they can do their operation without getting in trouble. We would be taken over by the Mexican Cartel, plus the cartel would most likely rob every Marijuanna store their is.

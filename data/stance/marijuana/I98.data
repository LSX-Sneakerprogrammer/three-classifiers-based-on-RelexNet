Fail to show what marijuana supposedly "does to people":  If you've done your research, you know what I'm talking about. If not I shouldn't be here.   Fail to show why law should regulate what you put in your body:  They already do,  F.D.A. , that's reason enough. If that's not good enough for you, talk to a lawyer.    Fail to prove that when more people use marijuana, and it's accepted, that there will be more people addicted:  Take statistics and logic.   My view of government is disturbing . Fine then, I'll prescribe you your natural anti-depressant that helps deal with this ugly fact of life.   My main issue with this whole argument is that I cannot believe that  THIS  topic, of all things, is the one that people get pissed off about...   One could strip us of every liberty imagined by our forefathers, and all we would do is sit and complain about our damned marijuana... THAT IS SICKENING!!! Not  my  view of government!!!! THE FACT THAT I HEAR ABOUT MARIJUANA 100 TIMES A DAY INSTEAD OF WTF WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM OR NAFTA OR WHATEVER THE HELL IS GOING ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND IRAN AND WHY SOME CERTAIN STATES ARE SEGREGATING SEXUALITY AND BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH....   No, all you can stand to do anything about is try to get your weed back. Maybe that's reason enough not to legalize it... Think about all of the people wasting their time trying to legalize it... then imagine them wasting x20 the amount of time being stoned all the time talking about how they finally got what they wanted...

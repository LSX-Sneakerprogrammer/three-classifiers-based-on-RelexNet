No alcohol does not just cause brain damage in minors. Thank you for the lesson in high school biology though.   http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/ aa63/aa63.htm     http://www.alcohol-drug.com/ neuropsych.htm     http://www.biologynews. net/archives/2005/11/07/ mapping_alcohol_brain_damage.html    Sustained alcohol abuse actually kills brain cells.   "The only difference is that marijuana smoke has way more carbon monoxide. Inhaling this will limit the amount of oxygen that can go to your brain and can kill brain cells if they do not get enough oxygen. It could also cause other parts of the body to not get enough oxygen, like the muscles and the heart."   Marijuana smoke does not kill brain cells. It does not lead to cerebral hypoxia.   "This is why when people are high, they slow down."   No first of all that is not why people "slow down." Your heart rate actually increases from ingesting THC. Once again you demonstrate how little you know about this.  You are trying to reference the fact that correlation does not prove causation. While they may have never proven 100% that if you smoke you will very likely get cancer, observational studies on humans have shown an incredibly strong link between smoking cigarettes and developing cancer. This is good enough proof for medicine.  But marijuana does not harm your blood vessels. Find me a source that says it does.

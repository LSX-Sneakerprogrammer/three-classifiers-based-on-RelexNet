What is truly pitiful is that one could find pity and fear in what you do not know. I use your post as supporting evidence.    Now, if you're realistically thinking about this issue, and not in Imagination Land, you would respect my point of view as a faction of the democratic comity. I am a citizen of these United States of America, and I know what that means.   I personally have no concern about the drug itself and I am fully aware that cigarettes and alcohol are more dangerous, but legal.   When I say that I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana, what I mean is for recreational use. Medicinal use is fine for the few drugs on the market that marijuana could (realistically) replace. Also, I actually advocate the use of hemp and wish America would get with the program, I know the benefits of hemp cloths and hemp oils.   What I don't like about weed, is what it does to people, and I am sure this is the reason it has been made illegal and mainly, why it has stayed illegal. I have seen the original arguments against it's recreational use, and I think that is absurd, it doesn't make you crazy, it doesn't make you blood thirsty, etc.    If you look at society as a whole, we already have a few cancers at work. Alcohol use, which with it brings tons of social deviance because it's a mind altering drug. Cigarettes, for the economy are bad, because those who smoke are hopelessly addicted and will spend money on cigarettes before spending it on things that they should buy, like food or clothes. Do we really, at this point need another? For people who don't drink, and for people who don't smoke cigarettes?   Like I said, think about it realistically. What is government for? Why is a government needed at all, I mean, what is the main single duty of a government???  It is to secure domestic peace , before anything else, that is what a government does. The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace. If someone steps out of line, because they have agreed to live under this government, are held to the same rules as the next. No one steps out of line, and we have a perfectly paired society to it's government. Unfortunately we, as humans, cannot have this.    So if the government only really exists to secure domestic peace, yet we already have a number of drugs out there, why should we have another to complicate things with.    Also, you have to imagine that weed is legal. No more will people feel the need to be home when stoned. They might as well get stoned in public. Like drinking, especially if it were made illegal, people would take their beer home with them, and drink there, most people  do , stay home and drink. If it were illegal, you wouldn't see drunk people as much now would you? I highly doubt you would.    Marijuana, I logically think, would be more addicting than tobacco and alcohol combined if it were made legal and then integrated into popular culture, as tobacco is. You get more for less, with less consequences... what a dream, right? I mean, if I am opposed to the legalization, yet I would still do it if it were, doesn't that mean something???   It's something that I don't want to deal with, and I think a lot of people would agree with me on this. If it were legalized, it would only get worse.    That's really all I can say for now, and sorry if it wasn't enough to satisfy your lack of understanding.    I would like to advise you that ad hominen arguments are not welcome here.      You are on a website that allows you to share ideas and opinions. Do not attack people for their opinions because, if you think that denying the legalization of marijuana is not American, you are doing the greater evil by suppressing the voices of the citizens that this democracy represents by using childish and petty insults.

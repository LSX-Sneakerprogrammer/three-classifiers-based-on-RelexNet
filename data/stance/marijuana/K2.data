Following your arguments:  1. Don't people still smoke cigarettes on the street?  2. Don't people still drive drunk?  (Just because you set these rules doesn't mean people will follow them.)  3. Marijuana would not be cheaper than it is today. If the government had control over it they would make the price way higher than it is at street value. And this wouldn't stop drug lords, do they not have cigarettes on the black market at dirt cheap prices? Wouldn't you buy from someone growing themselves at a cheaper price to avoid a tax? How does that stimulate a business let alone the whole economy?  4. The last thing we need is more people doing it. More people making it a problem for themselves, more people ending up in rehab at the governments expense. In fact I hate being around people doing it. They're so slow and stupid with their dumb eyes all squinted. I want to slap them and give them a good shake to snap out of it.  Your points have got to be the typical pothead's standpoint on this issue and it's not good enough, sorry.  Legalizing is not the solution.

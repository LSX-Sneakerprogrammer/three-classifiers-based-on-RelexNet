Alcohol brewing is not as popular as growing your own weed. Alcohol requires a lot of large machinery. Pot requires, well, a pot... and the sun and some water. I work out right next door to an alcohol brewing store. I've seen in the window and I don't think too many people would have that machinery in their homes.

I a little bit disagree with you, because as I think everything in this world can compare with something, I mean that any thing in comparison with others can be better or worse, and it always will be, so I want to say in comparison with tabacoo marijuana is more harmful, but accordinh to the same The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) alcohol drinks has bigger danger for health than marijuana.

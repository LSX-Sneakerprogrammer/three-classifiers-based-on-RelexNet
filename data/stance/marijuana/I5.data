that's cool, except the tax part. Why is government owed a tax for the growth or sale of this particular plant? We don't have special taxes for coffee, which is about the equivalent in overall social effect and harm-potential (that is, almost zero).  There's nothing that justifies that marijuana be subjected to anything other than standard sales taxes.

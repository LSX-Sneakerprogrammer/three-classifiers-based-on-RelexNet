One question, why do people have to do it in the first place? Are they that bored with their lives they need an extra boost to make them feel something? If people didn't do the drugs in the first place, that would be the solution, not legalizing or keeping it illegal. But I guess people are just dumb, that's all. If pot wasn't addictive, as most people claim, they can just stop doing it right?

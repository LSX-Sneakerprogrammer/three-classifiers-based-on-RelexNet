If I could type an emoticon of eyes rolling, I would. Consider my eyes rolled. If you want to talk about gateway drugs, let's talk about alcohol and tobacco, the two legal, harmful drugs that lead people to try other ones.   "There are many people who don't smoke pot because it is illegal"--This is an argument for the efficacy of prohibition, which, if we're being honest, is fairly ineffective. I could just as easily argue there are many people who smoke pot in spite of it being illegal. Does either argument address whether or not it ought to be legalized? No.   Marijuana has no business being illegal when it is less harmful than alcohol, a drug that is not only legal but used by a large portion of the population. Alcohol poisoning kills people every year, as does drunk driving. Marijuana cannot be overdosed on, nor does it make people over-confident or belligerent.   The latest marijuana ads have been more accurate than in years past. "We didn't shoot anybody. We just sat on Pete's couch". Granted, the point is made, marijuana users are less likely to be active. Then again, we could make the same argument about cable television watchers, couldn't we?

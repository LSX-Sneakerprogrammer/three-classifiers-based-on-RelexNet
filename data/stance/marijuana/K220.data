This is not the first time that drugs have been illegal, and it will not be the first time that the have been legalized. Consider the 18th and 21st amendments, which prohibited and legalized alcohol, respectively. The 18th amendment caused the rise of organized crime, and thousands of people died from drinking wood alcohol. With the 21st amendment, much of that went away.  Something similar will probably happen with Cannabis and other drugs. Once they can be regulated by the FDA and sold in reputable stores, the amount of crime will go down and quality will go up.

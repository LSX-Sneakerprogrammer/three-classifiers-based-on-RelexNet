If it's legal it means there will be more of it, more people smoking it   No, it means it will be more available. Looking at Portugal, Holland, or the US alcohol prohibition, I think it's unwise to assume that more people would therefore use it.   Children can already get it but if it's legal they will get even more of it. There will be no control of it because it can be grown. Therefore it can't be taxed.   Same point as above, and there is no control of it now, it can be grown now. It would definitely be taxed highly if it were legal, people can grow their own vegetables but they still buy them + pay tax. Lots and lots of money would be made off of marijuana, billions.   Using the "medicinal value" isn't a good excuse because they can isolate the medicinal value of the plant from the mind-altering part.   Not effectively, it's expensive and it's still not as good.   More people getting stoned more often means the chance of them coming to work high.   I could use the same argument against alcohol, or coffee. Workplaces will put policies into place to stop it, if it becomes an issue.   If you own a business would you hire someone who is a daily pot smoker?   No one's forcing you too. But there are thousands of people who smoke weed everyday, and still work well on the job, I don't see it as becoming a major issue.

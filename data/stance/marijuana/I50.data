I'm not a pot head, in fact I've only tried it once to know more about it, and I do not condone it's use... yet in many ways I would vote for it's legalization.  - War on drugs is too costly, especially with a failing economy.  - Hemp is very useful  - Violence on the streets will drop (but same goes for legalization of prostitution)  - So many People would not be incarcerated for doing something that is not, by any means, morally incorrect.  - The prohibition is flawed in that we allow more dangerous drugs to be sold  - etc.  - Potheads will finally shut up.  - etc.

I absolutely disagree with legalization of Marijuana!!!! It is nonsence, because Marijuana is the drugs and has "negative health effect is the long term effect on the hippocampus which retains memory in the brain. Research has shown that excessive marijuana smoking can cause damage to the brain" (http://futurepocket.com/2011/02/19/ why-the-government-wont-legalize- marijuana/)  Think about our children! I live in Kazakhstan, there is a suburb, the place where Marijuana grows and takes huge territory, As a result here is a lot of idiots because of constant using.

Technically speaking, the war on drugs does employ people. So that's a plus to it, right? Besides, marijuana is illegal for a reason. People abuse the drug as it is. If they legalize it, the abuse will grow exponentially. This applies for any illegal substance. If alcohol is made legal, for example, underaged drinkers would drink so much more than they did when it was legal. Of course, this could slow down over time, but do we really want that initial boom of drug abuse which we don't know when it will end?

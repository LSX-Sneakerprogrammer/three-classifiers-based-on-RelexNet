yea? and whats wrong with that? millions of people brew thier own alcoholic beverages... and software piracy is completely different than growing something.. software piracy is stealing... growing herb for your own consumption is victimless.... STUPID  maybe a select few will happen to circumvent the law... but are you retarded? look at american history with alcohol prohibition... CRIME RATES DROPPED.... look at the netherlands when they legalized drugs 20 years ago... CRIME RATES DROPPED and also DRUG CONSUMPTION DROPPED... Sorry but your argument is full of flaws and is speculative.... in fact i havnt seen you give me one cold hard fact, statistic, or referance

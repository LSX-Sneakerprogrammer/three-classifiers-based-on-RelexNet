Honestly, I thought this debate was over. I got enough opposition. :)  But when I look into legalizing something, I try to look at the worst case scenario and a likely scenario and combine them. In the case of pot, I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions (don't say it's not addicting. I  know  people that are addicted.) Worst case scenario, half the population would go out and buy it, get high and wreak havoc on America. Productivity would go down :) and some people would simply do reckless things.

yes it should be legal. why should alcohol be legal at 21 when alcohol CHANGES the person one is and alters views. one cannot function to the full ability while drunk. on the other hand when a person is high, the only thing that changes is ones eyes and maybe the mood of a person. but NEVER negativitily. and if pot can become legal, it will be taxed, causing more profit to the economy. why should tobacco be legal when it is grown from the earth like weed, but is altered and has POISIONIOUS chemicals put in it. when marijuana is grown and is not altered at all and is smoked and ingested. End of story, the only negative to pot is the fact that you are inhaling it, and almost any inhalent does damage. so to wrap things up, any individual whom actually has negative things to say about marijuana are just UNINFORMED so look all this up because it is all correct. & within 5 years gaurenteed, it will be legal.

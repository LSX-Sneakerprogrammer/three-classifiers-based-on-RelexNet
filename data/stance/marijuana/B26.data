If we legalized marijuana, it would likely bankrupt the cartels, which are profitable because they are the biggest "under the table" distributer. People would have no reason to buy from them when they could grow their own, or buy it cheaply from WalMart. The problem is that people under the influence of marijuana are more likely to commit crimes. If it is legalized, we need to be prepared to dump unlimited capital case appeals and do some executing.

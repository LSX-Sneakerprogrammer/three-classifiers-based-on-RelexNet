Actually it hasn't been proven. It could be linked to the person's lifestyle, or the fact that some people start smoking weed to cope with mental problems in the first place. However, it can affect memory, only if you are high literally all the time.  The worst thing I've seen happen is the person slows down a bit and starts being lazy because they find being sober too boring.   "Have you ever looked at your hand? I mean really looked at your hand?...oh, yeah. Sorry, man...Chronic misuse of marijuana has been widely identified as a significant risk factor for those with a predisposition towards developing various mental illnesses, particularly schizophrenia. However, it should be noted that people with mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder often "self-medicate" to relieve the symptoms of their disorders. Scientific studies of marijuana use, like the one released on 26 June 2007,[1] rarely take into account that the mental disorders of habitual users often go undiagnosed until after the patient has become a habitual marijuana user. It's possible that studies like the one mentioned above are politically motivated. People with pre-existing mental disorders also tend to abuse alcohol and tobacco. Yet, similar studies linking booze and cigarettes - both legal and heavily taxed - to mental illnesses are less common than those that focus just on marijuana. Therefore, the link between marijuana use and mental illness may be an instance when correlation does not equal causation.  Recent studies also indicated that brain structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus may shrink due to extremely chronic use, on the order of five "marijuana cigarettes" a day for upwards of twenty years, in the case of one study."   -Rationalwiki article on weed

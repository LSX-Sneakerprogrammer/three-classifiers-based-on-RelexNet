"If alcohol is made legal, for example, underaged drinkers would drink so much more than they did when it was legal"  What?? Alcohol IS legal. That's why you can buy it in a store after proving your age.   Oh and your "it makes jobs argument" is completely dwarfed by the fact that the economy would get billions of dollars in a new industry if it were legalized making way more jobs than the war on drugs has ever made and no longer would this revenue go directly into the black market. You just made my point for me. Thanks.

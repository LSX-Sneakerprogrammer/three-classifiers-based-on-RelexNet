Who left you in charge of deciding what is best for anyone (this is not meant as harsh criticism. It's meant to be constructive.)? What if they don't want control? What if they just want to be left alone to decide for themselves?  What duty? to whom? Why are other forms of escape acceptable? Why doesn't anyone deserve this form of escape? Why is Mr. Halo (video game) OK?  No, it doesn't explain your objection to its use. However, given that you're still forming your opinion, I'll up vote you to encourage you to explore my questions which are meant to get you to put a sharper point on your argument.

Making it illegal turns everyday citizens into criminals. The winner in the war on drugs is alcohol. For a drug that is in some ways not as bad as alcohol, some ways worse, but overall about on the same level, I think that it should be legalised. As mentioned by others, making it legal would be quite easy as you can apply the same laws as alcohol. Drug testing for drivers is now just as easy as alcohol testing so why not?

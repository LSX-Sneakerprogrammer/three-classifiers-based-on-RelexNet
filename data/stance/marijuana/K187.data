no its the governments job to create a safe productive land for people to live on... it is not the governments place to control personal aspects of my life that would have no affect on anyone else... the problem with government is that it is all about special intrests... the only reason weed is illegal is because some asshole from the logging industry got up in front of congress and lied through his teeth so hemp manufacturing wouldnt destroy his profits

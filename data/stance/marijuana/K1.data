Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I think we could save so much time and money just by treating Marijuana like a mixture of Cigarettes and Alcohol.  You don't smoke in public places.  You don't drive while under the influence.  And we can tax it. I'd bet it would still be cheaper than today. It wouldn't be such a risk to transport and sell, and more people would be doing it.

Do you have any evidence that legalizing marijuana would cause a significant increase in marijuana use? And don't try to "But by golly it's common sense don't cha know."  Also driving high is not nearly as dangerous as you think. Incredibly less dangerous than driving drunk. And much less dangerous than driving while texting. Unlike you I am actually going to cite a study, by the United States Department of Transportation no less:  “This report concerns the effects of marijuana smoking on actual driving performance. … This program of research has shown that marijuana, when taken alone, produces a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to consumed THC dose. The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight in their performance and will compensate when they can, for example, by slowing down or increasing effort. As a consequence, THC’s adverse effects on driving performance appear relatively small.”  REFERENCE: W. Hindrik and J. Robbe and J. O’Hanlon. 1993. Marijuana and actual driving performance. Washington, DC: US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Report No. DOT HS 808 078.  I am by no means suggested that it should be legal to drive high. I am merely demonstrating another failure in your chain of logic.  Marijuana legalized =&gt; More people use marijuana =&gt; More people drive high =&gt; There will be many more deaths as a result  Hypothetically speaking even if marijuana was proven to cause as much driving impairment as alcohol, this would still not be grounds for it to be illegal. One of the most dangerous things to do while driving is sleeping. But it isn't illegal to stay up for three nights in a row which will make it very likely for you to fall asleep at the wheel.  Your arguments are bogus and based upon myths and social stigma. I will gladly debate you on the legalization of marijuana.

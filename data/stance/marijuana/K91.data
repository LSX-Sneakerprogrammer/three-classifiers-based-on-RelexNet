Ya i agree with the sentiment, legalize. I can understand why you would want to have some control over distribution, keep it away from kids. But i don't know what a public store is. Where would you buy it then, a private store? I don't know what that means.  But anyway, the greatest benefit would be an end to mandatory sentencing that has destroyed so many young peoples lives.

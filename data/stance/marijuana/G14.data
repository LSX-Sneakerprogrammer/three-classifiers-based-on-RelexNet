Because everyone who thinks marijuana should be legalized is a pot head?  And I'm not sure what you mean by the same information, but obviously everyone who thinks marijuana should be legalized has the same stance.  Why would it matter whether the people debating had or not smoked marijuana? The quality of their debates is unrelated to their behaviors.   If you think that marijuana should still be illegal, I will debate you any time you wish.

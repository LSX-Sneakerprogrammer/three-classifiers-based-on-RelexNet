' Marijuana is not a drug, it's a plant that has side-effects when you set it on fire and sniff the smoke. ' - Katt Williams, Super Pimp.  The point of that quote is that Mary Jane really isn't a drug as we would categorize it. In fact, it's more a food then a drug. A drug is a substance, usually man made at the end of the processing, which is not intended for dietary consumption.  Marijuana gets you high  just  if you smoke it from the plant stage. You don't have to add a bunch of chemicals and shit like with all other 'drugs' suchs as cigarettes and meth.   And with said, marijuana is also not addictive, unlike other drugs.  Marijuana is mentally addicted, yes... but so is  ice cream . Do make ice cream illegal for all the fat people it's created? No.  Mary Jane should be legal. Cigarettes and alcohol should be banned.  Did you know it's impossible to overdose on Cannibis? It is biologically  impossible  to overdose on it. You'd have to smoke or eat so much of it that your stomach would explode or you'd suffocate before it could overdose you.  I think I've said enough.

I'll clear it up a bit:  First of all, an increase in cannabis users isn't a bad thing, but thats a different argument. If it were bad, though, it's only happening as a side affect of laws to begin with. Also, just because something is bad in the short term, doesn't mean it can't have long term beneficial side affects.  Also, the government doesn't want that. But it still happens. Interracial marriage was illegal. African American voting was once illegal, but now we have an African American president.

Do you have any evidence that legalizing marijuana would cause a significant increase in marijuana use? And don't try to "But by golly it's common sense don't cha know."   Any evidence that it  wouldn't  cause an increase? Come on, it IS common sense, which is almost worthless in a debate so it's not really fare is it?    Also driving high is not nearly as dangerous as you think. Incredibly less dangerous than driving drunk.   How dangerous did you think I thought it was? I wasn't saying it was equal. Just that we shouldn't add to a problem.    I am merely demonstrating another failure in your chain of logic.   What failure? Like I said. I don't think that driving high and drunk are the same. But they are both bad. And will happen more if weed id legalized.     But it isn't illegal to stay up for three nights in a row which will make it very likely for you to fall asleep at the wheel.   Well there's that common sense again. Some people are stupid. It should be illegal to drive if you are going on 3 days of no sleep. But thats hard to enforce. Laws against driving  high  on the other hand, is not as tricky to enforce.    Your arguments are bogus and based upon myths and social stigma. I will gladly debate you on the legalization of marijuana.   Calm down.

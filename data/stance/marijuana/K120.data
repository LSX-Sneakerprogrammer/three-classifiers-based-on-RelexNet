Dude, I dunno about other shit, but I'm productive as hell on pot. In fact, it's often the difference between me being able to function or not. This is how medicines, function, though, so it's only natural. I know many, many other people that fit this criteria as well.  There are people that handle large amounts of money (stock brokers, bankers, etc.) who smoke pot on a regular basis. There are a number of extremely successful celebrities who smoke pot. Just because our society associates laziness with stoner's doesn't mean pot makes you lazy. Thinking pot makes you lazy when you smoke it will make you lazy when you smoke it, though. Read that last sentence again, it's a bit confusing, but is very true.

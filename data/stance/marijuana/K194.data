The number of deaths due to marijuana is not low, it is 0. I don't care how impossible you think it is, try and find one death due to marijuana. If it was as dangerous as you seem to think it is surely it should be easy to find one.   "And pot is addicting. I know people, on a personal level, who are addicted to marijuana. You cannot deny that. "   Unless you are a doctor you are not qualified to diagnose an addiction in someone. And are you really going to try to use anecdotal evidence to combat scientific claims that it is not physically addictive. Just because someone does something a lot does mean it is addictive, that is a common misconception.  No you didn't come up with a negative factor of marijuana that it does not share with tobacco or alcohol, you came up one they share but said it is worse with marijuana, which it isn't anyway. Come up with something unique to marijuana, do you know what that word means?  It has never been proven that cigarette smoke causes cancer? You are joking right?  You think that inhalation of marijuana smoke can lead to cerebral hypoxia? Unless you inhale almost pure smoke continuous for a few minutes that can't happen. Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage. Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal.   How do you think doing a few bong hits leads to complete brain oxygen depletion for any amount of time whatsoever let alone an hour?  The website you are citing is exclusively referring to tobacco smoke. So all you are doing by citing it is furthering your hypocrisy.

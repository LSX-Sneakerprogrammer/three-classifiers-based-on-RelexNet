I've seen you post on a lot of debates, and as funny as your jokes are (/sarcasm), I have to disagree with your point. Although people may not be able to remember things as well while high, I do not believe there has been any study done to see if there is actually a correlation between marijuana use and memory loss. If I am wrong then please post the study. (Also do you think that a little memory loss warrants prohibition?)

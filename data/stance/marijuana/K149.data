First of all, those pot smokers that want it legalized are total idiots. All that will mean is that it will be heavily taxed. And this is why the war should continue, because there are plenty of other drugs far worse than marijuana, which will become much more desirable and widespread when the demand for pot decreases because of the increased cost. Basically, the legalization of one drug will help to advance the cause of other drugs, making them more acceptable to society. I personally don't want to live in a world where meth is a legal drug.

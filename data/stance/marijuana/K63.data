The government could make so much money if they just make it legal. First, they won't have to spend a lot of money trying to stop it. Trying to stop it this way is obviously not working. Second, the U.S. could make marijuana just another commodity. They could tax the use or the purchase of marijuana and actually make money.   However, it's probably in the best interest for the whole country if smoking pot in public is banned. Doing it at home is still the same as doing it outside.

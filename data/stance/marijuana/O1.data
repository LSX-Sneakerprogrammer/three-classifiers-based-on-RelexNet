In reality, Marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol, however, Marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug into crack cocaine, heroin, opium, etc. It is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high, not until relaxed. When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional. Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed, that is one reason alcohol is legal. Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco, however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does (as previously stated). Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain. It has proven poorer performance on thinking tasks, slower motor skill speed, poor attention span, poor verbal memory, and planning ability. Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected. With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run. Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues, it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue. Same goes with prescription medicine. Most of them only slow down your issue, not get rid of it. The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it. I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case and Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults. There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill. The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.

I smoke pot occasionally. I rarely smoke outside the confines of my home, so I needn't worry about getting "busted". Besides, I already pay way too much and if the government gets there hands in on it, which is bound to happen if legalized, I would also have to pay the taxes that are obviously going to be slapped onto it. The only way I would agree is if you could grow your own. I don't see that happening, because the government is going to want full control and regulation of its distribution.

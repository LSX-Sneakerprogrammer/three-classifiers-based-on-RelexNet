Okay then. If we were to make everything illegal because it was harmful to us in any way we would be living with next to nothing. Just off the top of my head fast food, junk food, driving, traveling. All of those are potentially dangerous. We shouldn't hold ourselves back because of it. If we taught people safer ways to smoke it then it wouldn't be as harmful.

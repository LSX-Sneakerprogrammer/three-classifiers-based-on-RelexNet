I think it should be legal, just like alcohol is. What's the difference anyway? At least pot is a natural plant and not a man made substance. Plus, since it is from nature, doesn't that say everything? Why did God put it here anyway? When do you ever here of fatalities on the road because of someone being high on pot? I think alcohol should be illegal if ANYTHING!

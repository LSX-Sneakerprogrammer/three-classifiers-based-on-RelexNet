Marijuana can prevent lung cancer.  Lung cells have a part of their DNA that serves as a self-destruct mechanism, so new ones can grow in. Tobacco destroys this sequence, so cells will keep replicating without self-destructing. Marijuana just kills the cell outright instead of messing up its DNA, so it's not only less harmful, it can prevent a bit of the damage tobacco does. Cuts tumor growth by half in mice.

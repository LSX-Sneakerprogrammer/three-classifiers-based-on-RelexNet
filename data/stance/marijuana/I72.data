Although I consider myself liberal, this is one issue that I strongly oppose! Marijuana, like tobacco, causes cancer as it contains carcinogens. Marijuana is also highly addictive. The tetrahydrocannabinol in it is what causes the addiction which make people crave it. Studies have also shown that uses of marijuana usually lead to more dangerous drugs such as meth and cocaine. If you believe that marijuana does not kill people, try telling that to the relatives of the 30,000 people in Mexico that died due to drug violence. Yes, marijuana is not the only drug that cartels produce and sell, but it is one of them. The only form it should be legal in is a medical form but should be used with intense care.

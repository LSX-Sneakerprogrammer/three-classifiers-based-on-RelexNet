"weed is not the most inspirational type of drug, all it does is relax your brain so you stop thinking at all"   Have you ever smoked weed? A lot of the arguments I'm seeing on here tend to revolve around the equation weed = crack. Weed does not equal crack, no matter how much the bullshit anti-weed propagandists wish it were so. I've smoked a ton of weed and it blows me away every time. I get amazing ideas, have awesome realizations about myself and people around me, and they still seem awesome later on..even when I'm not high.  "....(cause i know way more stupid people who do than smart people)"   Maybe that's because you just know mostly stupid people in general. Could be a biased sample.  Bill Maher, Mayor Bloomberg, Richard Feynman (Nobel Prize winning physicist), Carl Sagan (Cosmos), Friedrich Nietzsche, guess what? All potheads.

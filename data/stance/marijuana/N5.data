Furthermore, let's imagine ourselves in the place of parents, father or mother whose child was caught with marijuana in police. According to laws of many countries, this is a crime and it will be appearing in the personal file of person all his life. Imagine yourself, it's like a spot for the whole lifetime. Because of this, many young people break their lives, bacause once they took a drug and the police caught them. I think it's a little bit cruel and unfair. As a rule, in future these people will have some problems with work, with the opossite sex and so on, and all because they probably once in his life took a drug. Therefore, if government legalize marijuana it will give a real chance for a happy life of many young people all around the world.

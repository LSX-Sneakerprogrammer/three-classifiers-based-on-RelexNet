Weed is only laced when a joint is rolled and the user wishes to combine the drugs.    It is not combined with other drugs while still on the bud (as it is sold) because this would cost the dealer extra. Weed may be sprayed with silicone or other substances to cause it to weigh more. However, this practice would surely be eliminated if it were legalised and properly regulated.

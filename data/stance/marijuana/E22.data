Prohibition is doing more harm then marijuana. The government is wasting to much money on enforcing it, people are going to jail who shouldn't, people are being killed by poisoned marijuana and chemical relationships because its not being sold in a safe environment, in a safe way, but rather on the streets, and its not doing any good, also it can be sold to minors as easily as it can be sold to adults. Also the government loses a lot of tax money off the sale of marijuana.

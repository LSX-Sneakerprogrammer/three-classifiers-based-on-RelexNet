okay. so the only reason weed is illegal is because the freaking usa cant put a tax on it, it being to easy to grow. well tell me how that makes any since.. many people have vegetable gardens... yet vegies arent illegal and there easy grown as well. so that makes no since not to be able to tax weed. its a plant for crying out loud!!. it was out on earth for a reason to keep peace!. so smoke it up and spread the peace!. obama should legalize it! for one.. they need more money in the economy.. they would make a shit load if stores started selling weed and we would be out of recession, only everyone would be a pot head. so what if everyone was it would be normal right?.

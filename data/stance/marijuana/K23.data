Yeah it's exactly like driving a tank down the street while you are drunk and there are kids around you. Except for the fact that it doesn't harm yourself or anyone else. Instead of using inane analogies, how about you tell me specifically how marijuana is dangerous and I will explain to you why you are wrong. If you want to be taken seriously in a debate, don't say abstract and ridiculous things like marijuana is a weapon and like a bullet. If marijuana is so dangerous as you seem to think it is tell me how.

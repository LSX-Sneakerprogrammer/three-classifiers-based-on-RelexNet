can i just add sumtin here?...  can you imagine your kids smoking marijane?just look how many uses it while its still illegal and what more if it will be legalized...  it maybe healthy in any other way but...everything that is taken or done 'too much' or lets just say anything that can lead to addiction or be abusive is not healthy anymore its actually could lead to death and crimes.  and marijuana or cannabis is still in the classification of prohibited drugs."A recent study by the Canadian government found cannabis contained more toxic substances than tobacco smoke",it should remain illegal.

Well, yes, people still do those things. Don't people still murder other people? Don't people still embezzle money? All this still happens, but because it is illegal, it takes place less often. Don't people still sell marijuana and don't people still smoke it? Yes, they do. It's just much more dangerous and expensive to do so because it's illegal.  I believe the core of our disagreement here seems to be that we have opposing viewpoints on marijuana alone, whereas you seem to think of it as something bad; some kind of scourge of society. I don't see it that way. There has been endless debate over whether or not marijuana is harmful, and I choose to believe it's really not that bad. Either way, it should be a level-minded individual's choice to smoke marijuana, just like it's their choice if they wish to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, both very destructive substances, yet still legal. My core belief is that it should be the individual's choice whether to do something or not.  Although there is some small chance that you are  not  calling me a pothead, let's get something straight; I've never smoked marijuana, I've never done any other drug, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke cigarettes, and to be honest, I really don't plan on doing any of the above. I've made it thus far without them, and I don't have any real reason to start now. So, because of this, I can say that I have reasoning beyond what is simply personally more convenient.   The war on marijuana, not all drugs, but marijuana, sucks up  so much  federal, state, and local money. Couldn't this money be better spent enforcing the other laws, say, the ones that keep people under the influence off the roads? Or maybe we could put this money towards something we can all enjoy, like lowering taxes. There are just better ways to spend our money.  You make good points, and I understand what you are getting at, I just wholeheartedly disagree.

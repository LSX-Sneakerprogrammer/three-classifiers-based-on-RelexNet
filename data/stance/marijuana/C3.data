They aren't really locking people up for possession of a small amount anymore. Those people may go to jail if they are driving under the influence, but they aren't usually kept in jail. Most people get fines.  They usually only incarcerate the dealers, and sometimes not even the small time dealers do much time. They're after the bigger guys.   The prisons are full, and possession of marijuana ranks at the low end of the scale for jail time.   Why add another drug to the list of legal ones that can screw you up?   Why don't we just do like Mexico? You can get anything you want on a street-corner "pharmacia".

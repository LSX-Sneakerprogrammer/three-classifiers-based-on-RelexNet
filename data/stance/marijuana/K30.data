LEGALIZING =/= DECRIMINALIZATION    If you want to smoke weed, don't make the argument for decriminalization. Legalization and decriminalization are two different subjects.   The arguments against " War on Drugs " usually has more to do with people wanting it legalized than it does decriminalizing it because it's an easy target with numbers and panders to everyone's fear of government.    Typical Legalization Propaganda:     "Look at all these poor non-violent people stuck in prison, all they wanted was to get high, and it costs us $20394 per second to chase one of these poor fellers down, and then another $79887987 a year to keep him in prison. How dare you government, shame on you, and shame on us for doing this to them, legalize now(1)!  (1)If you pass this info along maybe someday you could smoke pot too(2)  (2) Not right now though, but when it's legalized ;)..."

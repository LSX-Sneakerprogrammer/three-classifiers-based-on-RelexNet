Isn't that funny...I don't think your question had anything to do with HEMP being useful. I used to be a weed smoker in the 60's, 70's and 80's along with other things offered along the way. I never really drank so pot was a miracle to me. I've thought about it for many years and today we know a great deal about what we inhale or ingest than we did back then.  After all that wonderful thinking I came to the conclusion that weed should not be legalized because of the abuse factor and not for any other reason. If I was still out there partying like I did years ago, I'd probably enjoy a few tokes for a nice buzz and although marijuana itself does NOT lead to other drugs, in the wrong hands a person with an addictive mindset/personality WILL go past the joint or two over the week-end. Pot laced with what have you will send you reeling and there is plenty of stuff out there to lace it with. For the safety of all, I would say no, don't legalize it with the exception of those who are terminally ill and have been prescribed it to calm them and take away some of the pain.

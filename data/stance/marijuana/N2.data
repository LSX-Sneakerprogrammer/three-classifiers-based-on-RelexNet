I truly agree with you that it's no more harmful than tobacco and alcohol , There are many disadvantages from both and in my opinion i wouldn't legalize both of them in our state. According to the scientist David Geffen cigarette smokers may feel that their tobacco addiction is far less harmful than smoking an illegal drug such as marijuana. Marijuana smokers who abstain from tobacco sometimes boast that their drug of choice is safer than cigarettes. The truth is that both tobacco and marijuana have damaging effects. Those who smoke both cigarettes and marijuana suffer the compound consequences of two different drugs destroying their health simultaneously.That's why advice to all smokers don't smoke because you can die early

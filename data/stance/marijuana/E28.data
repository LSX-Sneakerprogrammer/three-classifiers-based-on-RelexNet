The argument you're using is what they call a "slippery slope rationalization" and it's completely flawed. If Marijuana is directly connected to harder drug use, then cigarettes lead to marijuana use and they should also be illegal... This makes about as much sense as saying that 6th graders playing "spin the bottle" leads to unprotected premarital sex. And if pot proceeds really went to terrorists, then we should legalize it, tax it, regulate it, gain the profits ourselves, and eliminate the terrorists' market. Also, apathy can be fueled by many many things aside from pot. I don't see anyone racing to ban television.

So in other words, you have no idea, but simply think that it would? Your "common sense" is based on assumption. And Common sense is often wrong for this reason.   No, I have seen people do stupid things under the influence of marijuana, like attempting to drive a car while blazed out of their minds.   SO???  A lot of companies will fire people for showing up late to work, should that be illegal?   I am only trying to demonstrate a principle, not suggesting we illegalize everything that causes people to lose jobs.   Marijuana is not addictive.   "According to the 2008 NSDUH, marijuana accounted for 4.2 million of the estimated 7 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs. In 2008, approximately 15 percent of people entering drug abuse treatment programs reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse; 61 percent of persons under 15 reported marijuana as their primary drug of abuse, as did 56 percent of those 15 to 19 years old." -National Institute of Drug Abuse  About 9% of frequent marijuana users will develop a dependency. That's a lot of people if you open it up to the whole nation.   Let me further demonstrate why this statement is idiotic.  Desperate people, will sometimes do desperate (and often illegal) things, such as stealing a car....therefore we should outlaw cars. Following your logic.   That is not at all my logic. if it was, I would have said that we should keep marijuana illegal because people get it illegally. Rather what I am saying is that it is only common sense that it can be a contributor to crime.   Marijuana does not hurt anybody   It most certainly does. There have been many deaths directly linked to marijuana use. Car crashes are a common way in which people under the influence of marijuana harm themselves, and others.

1. Tobacco is _the_ most addictive substance known to man. Comparing it to cannabis in this way is a joke.  2. The numbers for marijuana related auto deaths compared to alcohol are laughable. Keep in mind many people also drive while on vicoden, anti-depressents, etc. The lesson here is don't drive if your fucked up (on anything).  3. Pfffffff. Arguing that the government would regulate it in a way that would increase the price is ridiculous. If I could buy a 'pack' of marijuana cigarettes for the same price as tobacco, even while tobacco is heavily taxed, that would be awesome and very very cheap. Have you heard the numbers that the government has been considering? I've heard $50 a plant for growing - a single plant can procure about 6 grand worth of medicine. It's still going to be cheap.  4. Just because you don't like it or how it effects other people gives you no right to make choices for others. Just like just because I don't like drinking doesn't mean I think everyone should be banned from drinking.  Even if you think Legalizing is not the solution - the war on drugs is also NOT the solution. A good solution might be to change the war on drugs to be the war on addiction, and then also legalize pot.

so you're saying that if the jazz musicians didn't use it... they wouldn't make as good music?  especially since weed isn't a hallucinogenic drug or any of that, it's hard to believe that it can actually create good ideas. what it does is reduce stress levels at a max. those who are less stress MIGHT be able to think better.  it mainly has to do with the fact that many musicians just like to do weed and other drugs. look at Ray Charles. do you think heroin actually helped him make his music? he did a shit load of it.

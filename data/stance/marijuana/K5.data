People don't use Marijuana to  cure  anything, just in the same way we don't use Aspirin or any other painkiller, or most medicines, to cure anything, as most medicines are used to treat the symptoms until the ailment goes away, or, if it never does, to make life a bit more bearable.   Prohibition didn't work for a reason. People don't take too well to getting their freedoms taken away. Alcohol was part of the national culture. While marijuana is not part of our national culture, we would still be better off making it legal.

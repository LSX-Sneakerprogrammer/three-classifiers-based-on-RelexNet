I've known those people too. Those are the kids who I think it would happen to no matter what. From my experience, they generally have enormous issues. From my experience, they escalate from one drug to another in a very short time.   The people I'm talking about cutting off from the dealer are the ones who just want to relax on pot for a while, and have no real intention of ever turning to anything heavier. The ones who it takes a lot to get them to try anything new. The ones who after months and months of "Just try it, on the house, no worries," finally give in thinking "Just once." That's how my ex started on speed. For years he had smoked pot, saying that doing anything else was a fool's game. But all his "mates" (i.e. his dealer and the guys he hung out with while he was at his dealer's house) were doing it, and they were all egging him on. So the first time, he tried it at a quarter dose. But he refused to inject it. He was adamant about that. He dropped balls... meaning he swallowed small amounts of speed wrapped up in cigarette papers. For about a year he tried it off and on, which was enough time for him to get well and truly hooked on it. At which point he started injecting it. I left him soon after. He's gone on to do pretty much everything since, and last I heard he was on the methadone program.  If pot had been available over the counter, I doubt that his habit would have escalated beyond pot. He would simply have been too lazy to go and find someone to sell him something illegal.

The moment marijuana can get sold over the counter in stores at a cheaper price that your local drug dealer can supply it, it removes the "gateway" part of it. Users are lining up at the supermarket rather than lining up at the drug dealer's house.  The exposure to the dealer is the part that makes it a gateway. Because that dealer has a vested interest in getting you to use something much more highly addictive. That dealer gets more out of you if you're going to him every other day rather than once every few weeks.

Well, I would almost agree with that, but then that creates a huge black market all over again that is completely unregulated. People will be harming themselves with dirty alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs because of lack of regulation on these substances. It's currently a problem with cannabis because it's illegal.  You are on the right track though, making them illegal is definately the wrong way to go about it.

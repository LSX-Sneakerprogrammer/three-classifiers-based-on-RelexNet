I was aware that you were for the most part joking, I just get a little annoyed when people say that people who do weed are stupid (not that this is what you said).  As for music, I can give you a whole list of artists and songs that were influenced by marijuana. My favorite example would be Bob Marley but there are many others.   I would say that the reason you know more stupid people than smart people that do weed is probably because there are more stupid people in in the world than smart people, but then again I don't know who you hang out with so I can't make a judgment.   If you look at most collages, especially liberal ones, you will find a significant portion of the student body either has tried or regularly uses marijuana. What this says to me is that there are a significant amount of intelligent people who do use the drug.

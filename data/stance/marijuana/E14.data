Not at all. Just make it illiegal to sell to minors, and restrict minors from puchase and use...how is this any more harmful than a cigarette?  Feel free to discuss mind altering affects, but NOTHING in the world has a more negative affect on the mind than nicotine...trust me, I use both. I never waited for a guy to finish a joint so I could swoop in a finish the last few drags.

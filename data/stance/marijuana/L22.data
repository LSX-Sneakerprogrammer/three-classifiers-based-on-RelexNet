I both favor and oppose because I agree with some and not other portions of your post. Indecisive? Not I..lol!   You're right that not many people ask where their stuff is from but even the dealer has a duty to the buyer to expose a heavy additive. There is such a thing as honor among thieves you know!!! In my time if we found weed laced with angel dust or whatever the buyer would go back and beat that dealer to a pulp. A bad dealer gets no customers and word goes around like wildfire. If you found a good one you'd usually stay with him depending on seed and unsmokable content. If MJ were sold legally and those who bought it wanted it laced, they'd do it themselves. I don't know if people would use it as a substitute for tobacco or alcohol though. It's an entirely different feeling and effect. You're absolutely on target with the medical aspects though.  I agree also with the taboo/illegal factor. The mental aspect is there and always has been. It's not unlike anything else that has not be legalized. I'm not sure I believe the statistics here or abroad. I'd have to see how, what, and whom they asked. I'd like to think they would give a great deal of weight to a certain age group.

Altarion I have never and plan never to smoke pot, but I know plenty of people that do smoke pot.  Weed is not physically addictive like cigarettes are, pot does not make people stop caring about their lives at all. Drugs like meth can do things like that as well as heroine or cocaine but not marijuana. Jane can be considered a gateway drug and in a lot of cases jane is a lot less harmful that alcohol is to our bodies. Pot does not do anywhere near as much damage to those around us than what alcohol does, getting high is just like a boost for the day. I know students that are in the top of my sophomore class that smoke pot regularly and are within top 20 out of a 600 student class.  The only thing I see that could come out of legalizing weed would be that since Americans already spend their money on weed now why not tax the shit and bring the US gov some extra pocket change?

I  reeeeeallly  hate when you put words in my mouth. I didn't say a single thing you attributed to me in this rebuttal.   I hope this is the product of tangential thought, and not a conscious effort to shift the discussion away from what you can no longer defend.  In response: When you're making assertions about their effects on musicians, firsthand experience goes a long way. Especially in discussions of (as yet) qualitative distinctions between two modes of creative catalysis.   I'm not saying musicians who don't do drugs are better. I do know that the greatest innovators have almost all been drug users.   I couldn't tell you whether abstainers are holding themselves back, I'm not fucking psychic. Drugs have different effects on everyone. If I had to guess, I would say yes, they probably would be a tiny bit more creative if they tried certain drugs. Note that this belief is  not mutually exclusive  with the idea that drugs aren't needed to be creative.  You know, if it sounds too stupid for someone to have argued it, why don't you read back over it and see if they really did? I'm still in utter disbelief that you think I said  all of that BS .

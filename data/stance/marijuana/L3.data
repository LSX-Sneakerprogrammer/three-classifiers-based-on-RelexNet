i guess joke isn't in your vocabulary, but since you decided to go about it... lets refute some of this.  most of the artists did waaaaay more than weed. weed is not the most inspirational type of drug, all it does is relax your brain so you stop thinking at all. LSD, on the other hand, has actually been apart of the music industry waaaay more than weed. and still, i wouldn't call most artists intelligent at all. creative, sure, but intelligent???   i never said that ONLY stupid people do weed, but at least all the stupid people who do (cause i know way more stupid people who do than smart people) will just be at home instead of wasting my time with their protests.

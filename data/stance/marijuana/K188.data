First of all you have no evidence that there would be a significant increase in marijuana use immediately following legalization. Furthermore why do you think an increase would cause "pandemonium" as you put. I don't think you understand the physical effects of marijuana. You need to forget everything you know stemming from the reefer madness movement. Marijuana does not cause people to have giant drug and violence filled orgies in the street.

"I highly doubt marijuana would spark a billion dollar industry."  You obviously haven't done ANY research. Well, I have. :)  Here:  "According to the data, the state's medical marijuana patients are currently consuming somewhere between $870 million and $2 billion worth of weed a year. That would translate to somewhere between $70 million and $120 million in state sales tax revenues, the authors estimated."  from  http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/467/                                        california_medical_marijuana_could_ increase_tax_revenues     We're already (meaning, like, right now) getting 120 million dollars in revenue from California alone. There's no reason why this couldn't increase to a billion or more federally if legalized nationally.

Our prisions are overcrowded... and there are pleanty of other crimes that police officers could be investigating... The current "anti-drug industry" would not lose any money... it would just be allocated elsewhere. Also if you look at other countries that have legalized drugs, they seem to have FAR less problems with abuse and dependancies than we do by criminalizing it...

Weed is already legal in other countries. If you don't agree with this policy of American law, then GTFO and go somewhere that suits your needs better. The reason most people want to live in America is because we have amazing policies and laws that not many other countries have. So if you are going to make a fuss over a stupid thing like this, then just GTFO of America and move to somewhere in Europe, South America, or Mexico.

I do not support a ban on Alcohol. Nor Do I support a ban on Marijuana. In fact, I have not spent one single moment of my time here saying that it should remain illegal. All I am saying is that it does alter one's state of mind which can lead to crime just as alcohol can, whether it's addictive or not. We need to be prepared for the ramifications of legalizing Marianna if/when it happens.    If Soda was illegal, then drinking Soda would be a contributor to crime. It's only "contributing to crime" because it's illegal.   That's not the same logic. Ideally, marijuana use would be legal, driving would be legal, and they would never happen at the same time. But suppose it does, and someone mows down a pedestrian at a crosswalk and gets charged with manslaughter. In that case, marijuana use would be a contributor to the crime, but not illegal in itself, much like alcohol is now.   Legalizing marijuana does not necessitate repealing "driving under the influence" laws. Driving while high, would still be illegal, but recreational use in the privacy of one's own home should not be illegal.   I agree. But just like alcohol, people will still use it and drive. Especially if it's made legal. Again, I don't advocate it remaining illegal based on that principal, but we must be ready to deal with more high drivers, because that's probably what will happen.

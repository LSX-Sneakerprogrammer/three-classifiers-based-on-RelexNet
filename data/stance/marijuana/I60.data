I'm not that concerned with Marijuana. I'd never use it, and I don't let my boyfriend either. I think it is a cop-out and a rather stupid thing to get into.   I don't mind it being legalized, though I'd rather it not. I'd even go so far as to say alcohol shouldn't be legal either.   I don't, however, like the way these things are prosecuted. I'd rather see users treated like those in need of medical and psychological attention. There shouldn't be anything on their permanent records, they shouldn't go to jail or prison, and they shouldn't be stigmatized.   Users should be sent through rehabilitative structures and helped to find better ways to spend their time and money. Educating themselves, expanding their minds, getting good jobs, having fun in more productive ways. Users should be helped towards a better, happier life without the need for mind altering chemicals.   Pushers, however, are a different matter. Small-timer pusher and pushers of less dangerous drugs should go through the same services. But people selling deadly, horribly destructive drugs to people are partially responsible for their downward spiral. They should be punished, with jail time and prison time (depending on what they did and how they did it) followed by rehabilitation and job training/higher education.

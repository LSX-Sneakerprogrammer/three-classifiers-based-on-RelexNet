I agree with most of this, although I am talking about addiction in the medical sense, that withholding a substance will cause withdraws. Conversely nearly anything could be "mentally addictive" but that's more of a result of a weak state of mind that it is of an inherent addictive quality that something may posses.   I agree that because something is harmful for oneself is not reason enough to may something illegal. If someone wishes to harm their own body, this is no concern of the Government.

Yes, we would take away the war between us and mexico. but if we have to chose between that and the cartel shooting in our streets I know which one I would chose. There is always a double effect. One thing happens causing another. If we legalize then the cartel will move here to make a larger profit. That would cause an effect that makes america fall. We would have shootings in our streets and detectives being forced to shut up.

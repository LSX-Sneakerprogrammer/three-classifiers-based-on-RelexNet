My Spring semester of my freshman year in college was when I discovered weed. This semester I pulled 3 A's and a B, successfully worked out five days a week despite "the munchies" and held a steady job. I was not late for class or the job, and thus disproved that pot smokers are unproductive members of society. At my peak I was smoking once every day. Statistics also show that no one has died as a result of weed, nor gotten addicted, nor gotten a "hangover" the morning after, and alcohol has led me to do more things I regretted, disproving that weed is the true "gateway" drug. Weed has also been scientifically proven to NOT directly cause lung cancer as cigarettes do, and if legalized, the revenue will soar sky high. Legalize it!

I totally agree. In addition to this argument, marijuana should be legal for many reasons. It would be financially beneficial for farmers to grow marijuana in their fields in the U.S. Instead of relying on prescription drugs, marijuana helps with medical conditions concerning: Glaucoma, arthritis, cancer, pain, nausea, AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis, Brain Injury/Stroke, Anti-Tumor Effects, Asthma, Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Migraine, and eating disorders. It also helps with increased intelligence and focused attention. Marijuana should have been legalized when alcohol was legalized.

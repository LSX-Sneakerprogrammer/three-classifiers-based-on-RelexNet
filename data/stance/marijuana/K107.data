1. It's no longer the 70's. We know plenty about pot. It's not bad for us.   2. Getting any substance off the street is dangerous. If it were legal, then safe marijuana could be easily attained. The laws keep marijuana use dangerous, marijuana use doesn't make marijuana use dangerous, however.  3. It is harmless in moderation. No study or research ever done has suggested anything otherwise. Please prove me wrong with references.

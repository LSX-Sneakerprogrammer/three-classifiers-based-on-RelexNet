Marijuana is a DRUG. These substances cause negative effects on the human body. Alcohol, tobacco, and even caffeine are great examples of why marijuana should not be legalized. All of these substances cause detrimental effects on the human body. Alcohol has the ability to destroy your liver, and tobacco can cause many forms of cancer. Marijuana makes you sleepy and hungry, it is USELESS. If you want to do something "recreational" you should go out and exercise or play a sport. Smoking a useless plant isn't "recreational."

Actually, I'm not a stoner. I don't like the stuff, tried it once when I was 18, had a bad reaction, and I've never tried it again. However, that doesn't stop me from seeing that it has huge economic benefits. Plus I've seen its benefits on a friend of mine who has scoliosis. Muscle relaxants do very little for him and they have bad side effects, whereas pot helps him to function and leaves him relatively pain free.

That's why I said "... underaged drinkers ..." I know for a fact that most of my friends, myself included, would surely go out and buy liquor if we could. But we can't, so we can't exactly drink, now can we? That would require an irresponsible adult. :)  I highly doubt marijuana would spark a billion dollar industry. There would still be a lot of private growers to circumvent the taxes on it and to make it cheaper. I'd say the same for cigarettes, but tobacco is not the only thing in there. It's a precise mixture of dozens of substances and chemicals, so people can't exactly manufacture that on their own.

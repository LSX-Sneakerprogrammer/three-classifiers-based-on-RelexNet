I hardly ever drink. I really don't see the point. You literally are feeling the effects of a poisoning of your system and a hangover is usually just dehydration sickness. It's a pointless drug that people are allowed to ingest because it makes them stupid, but many do seem to enjoy it.   Recently a bill was introduced into the California Legislature that called for the legalization of Marijuana in the state. In the bill it stated that the industry created from this would bring in more that a billion dollars in tax revenue. That's just the tax revenue it would generate and just in California.  As to your point about private growers:  Do you grow your own food?.... I rest my case. It's a matter of convenience. Some will do it ,yes, but most won't.  And people can and do grow their own tobacco. I have a few friends who carry around a bag of tobacco and rolling papers for cigarettes precisely for the reason you stated. Personally, I find cigarettes to be even worse that alcohol. The only positive your system ever feels from a cigarette is the quench of a physical addiction due to the nature of the substance.

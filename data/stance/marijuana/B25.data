The only health danger is the tar, which can be practically eliminated with vaporizers; legalization would open up a larger market for vaporizers, increasing demand, increasing competition and bringing prices down so that the market expands even more. Also as part of the condition for legalization the government can provide tax breaks and such for such companies, to decrease the only serious health risk and to improve the economy.   If the purpose of a law is to give as much freedom to people without allowing those people to neglect or abuse others rights, then what right is being threatened by marijuana usage? So called "hard drugs" can lead to many social issues and can actually be directly correlated, and scientifically shown to be part of the cause of right violations. Marijuana has less correlation to such things then the few currently legal drugs. Marijuana is unjustly prohibited.

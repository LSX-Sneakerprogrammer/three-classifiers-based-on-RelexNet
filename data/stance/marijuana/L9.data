so, basically, i HAVE to do drugs in order to know how great they are...  i do play instruments, and i do just find without drugs.  so i guess straight edge bands would be better if they weren't straight edge... they're actually limiting themselves by staying clean. you seem to act as if weed is smoked by EVERY musician. maybe weed is just a fun, harmless drug and that's why so many musicians do it compared to hard drugs. but what about the creative geniuses who don't do them? are they just holding themselves back?   or are you willing to say that they're strong enough to not need drugs in order to further their creative process.

Considering so many people are so down on the fact that cigarette companies even exist I think it ridiculous that people want to legalise something that has four - seven times the amount of tar (the cancer causing agent) in one cone than in one cigarette, you inhale deeper, hold in for longer and lose the ability to make proper judgement, drive a car, or become paranoid, or if your lucky enough to get the really good stuff, think you are dying. And if it was legalised you could guarantee it would be lower in THC. If you want to smoke legally, go for a trip to Amsterdam. I'm sure there are alot of positive aspects such as taking it of the black market and taxing it (monetarily) and do agree on most grounds, but if you take a look at the outcome in the long run, I don't feel its a good idea. It may free up the courts from drug busts, but it would fill the courts in people selling to the underaged,as with cigarettes and alcohol, people suing over cancer claims, insurance problems, and the list goes on. Also I don't think cops are evtremelly hard on the dope smoker, but they can use this to get someone off the streets that are under suspicion of other harder crimes. I say, keep it illegal.

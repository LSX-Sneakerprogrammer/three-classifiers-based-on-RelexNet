How do you know if Marijuana helps or doesn't help people in need? That's a pretty bold statement to make for everyone that's had any ailment (which there are many: migraines, insomnia, post traumatic stress disorder, PMS, etc.) that pot could help, don't you think? Where's the evidence to back this up?  Pot is not physically addicting. However, caffeine, is addictive. Whether or not something is or isn't addictive shouldn't be the only criteria for determining it's safety within society. If it were, then all pain killers would be illegal in addition to coffee and tea and probably television.

No marijuana does not kill brain cells, this has been disproved time and time again. The only study that proved anything about the relationship between marijuana and brain cells showed that it hinders the growth of cancers brain cells while leaving healthy ones alone.  I'm assuming since you are against the legalization of marijuana just because "a drug is a drug, plain and simple," that you support the prohibition of alcohol and marijuana.  And what exactly do you define as a drug? Just something that is illegal? Then your argument is even less intelligent. It should be illegal because it is illegal?

I really don't care one way or another. I mean, it's not like a mess with it. As far as the kids, it's a parent's responsibility to instill the ability to make good choices on their children. I have two daughters. I wouldn't expect the government to make having sex illegal just so that my girls don't end up pregnant. It's my responsibility to teach them, keep them from getting pregnant and deal with the aftermath if I fail in my responsibility.

Ah, your an idiot. Ok, gotcha. :)  As long as we're clear.  Not all candy, soda, etc. has high fructose corn syrup, BTW. Not all tea contains Caffeine, either.  I highly doubt you're claim to have never consumed a single thing for pleasure.  And if it IS true - then you are completely insane anyway.

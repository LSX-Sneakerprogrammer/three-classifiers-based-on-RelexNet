I cant believe I am saying "legalize", cause every time the pothead in the flat below mine starts smoking it, the whole block of flats starts stinking of skunk.  Part of me thinks that it should remain illegal so people can call the police and arrest the inconsiderate idiot... but after a bit of thought, I have changed my mind.  If it was legalized, then pot would probably be of better quality, and closely monitored for its ingredients.   If it was legalized, and you could only get it from your doctor, then it would be easy to detect addiction and the doctor could refuse to give you any.   If it was legalized, then there would be no dodgy characters entering my block of flats to sell not only pot but the whole array of harder drugs.  If it was legalized, some of the money that pothead is paying could be used to benefit the rest of us in taxes, and not only a small group of criminal barons.   But, alas, it is illegal... so now I have to put up with skunk smell and shadows creeping in the night to sell it.

I agree with you until your getting high poses a threat to others.  For instance, I think it's okay to take drugs in the privacy in your own home without an intent to hurt anyone else.  However, if you were home with your family, got high, and began to do dangerous things or hurt your family because of your getting high - that's not okay.  As long as the only 'victim' - if there even is one - is yourself, I don't think anyone should really have a say in what you do.

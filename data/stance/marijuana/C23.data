if it's legal it means there will be more of it, more people smoking it, and more problems associated with it. It's been proven that marijuana affects short-term memory and motor skills, and gets stored in the fatty tissue for up to 10 days or longer.  Children can already get it but if it's legal they will get even more of it. There will be no control of it because it can be grown.  Therefore it can't be taxed.  Using the "medicinal value" isn't a good excuse because they can isolate the medicinal value of the plant from the mind-altering part.  Being illegal has been somewhat of a deterrant but if we take off the deterrant more people will be stoned more often. (take abortion for example). More of it around equals more children ggetting ahold of it. Is this what you want?  More people getting stoned more often means the chance of them coming to work high. This creates a safety issue for EVERYONE, including the quality of any products that come from that company. Do you want to be driving a car put together by a stoner?  If you own a business would you hire someone who is a daily pot smoker? Your insurance company would dump you quick if that's the case. That's why they implement drug screening at the work place. The insurance companies are behind it.  If you want to smoke pot don't expect to keep your job. Even if it's legal.  They can even take your kids away for it. Divorces can get messy ya know.

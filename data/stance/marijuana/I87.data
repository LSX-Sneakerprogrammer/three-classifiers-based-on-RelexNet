What I find hard to believe is that this question pops up all of the time on the internet... and nothing changes...  In debates, if you say one thing in opposition to it's legalization you are immediately discriminated against and ignored for the valid points that you may have, and then the people advocating it's use have nothing more to show in their argument than what you have, but sensationalized, and even though they don't have credible evidence (ok, so one does), they call you out for not having evidence, and like children, hop around proclaiming your stupidity...  Arguing this topic online is useless, and I have always thought that. You are all like Gollum with the ring of soromon... there's no point.   BTW, if you are so right, do something about it already so that I don't have to hear about it anymore.

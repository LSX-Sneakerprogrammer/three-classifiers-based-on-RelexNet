"Honestly, I find it both morally and ethically corrupt to even desire a substance for pleasure" Are you serious? You think it's morally corrupt to want to do something that makes you feel good? And we are animals. The belief that humans are somehow above doing things that make us feel us good makes no sense. You're 23, you still have a lot to learn about life.  "You just want you weed because the alcohol, cigarettes, caffein, television, shopping malls aren't good enough."  Hmm you seem to be using the internet as a source of entertainment. Apparently you're the one who needs artificial stimulation. Quite pretending to be better than everyone else and realize your hypocrisy.

It's always easier to medicate yourself to increase  preferred  performance... What does that mean about your natural state though, your worth as a human without it? There are ways, maybe too primitive for this generation of "successful actors" and counters to accept, but it's far more effective in the long run and you have a better understanding shit while you're doing it and afterwords too... it's called "discipline". A trick that seems to be all but forgotten, today... I wonder if it's because anyone can just go grab some form of "medication" to make themselves appreciate their own work and the world around them.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----------    Honestly, I find it both morally and ethically corrupt to even desire a substance for pleasure, let alone demand it come easier. The ultimate weakness and surest sign of gluttony, bitching about your unnecessary substances.   "I know many, many, many other people that fit this criteria as well."   So what? Many, many, many other people strive to define humanity as something other than a waste of billions of years of evolution and suffering for burnt plant fumes that create a careless and happy go lucky floaty feeling.   I'm one of those people that know the meaning and worth of discipline. There's something sacred about reality and the way that the earth is when it's "dull" and quiet that no one seems to get... everything needs to be brilliantly colorful, exciting, relaxing, whatever, some form of artificial stimulation needs to be administered to get any good experience out of anything. It can't just be left alone and truly appreciated the way it is.   I don't have a problem with the drug, I have a problem with people. I don't have a problem with people, but that they still act like animals. I feel like I'm the only real human left, like the only person I'm fighting for is myself, to show myself that I'm not a monster like the rest of you. That I'm actually worth the effort put forth by my bloodline a million fold because I am different. I won't lay down because it feels good, I won't lay down because "I need a break" in my finite life of only 23 years, I won't lay down because I deserve it!   Laying down is for the weak. That's what you fools are doing. You just want you weed because the alcohol, cigarettes, caffein, television, shopping malls aren't good enough. You just want your plant.   Now, I bit good riddance to you and your damned marijuana, I have work to do.

As I recently found the information that the majority of American people believe legalizing marijuana is the right course for the country. In a new Gallup poll, 50% of Americans is for legalizing marijuana, while 46 came out against it. Today as I know government spend a lot of money to fight with marijuana, but I think it's all done in vain and ineffective, because I recently read an article where it was written that 28.5 million Americans age 12 and older had abused marijuana at least once in the year prior. By contrast, 51.9 percent of Americans age 12 and older (or roughly 100 million people) had used alcohol at least once in the 30 days prior to being surveyed in America. It seems to me that it would be much better if government direct all this money to improve education and medicine. Likewise, maybe, the rate of corruption will decrese.

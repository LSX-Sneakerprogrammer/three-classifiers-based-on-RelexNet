We should stop trying to stop the pot heads.  I hate drugs too because they are unhealthy & deadly but I don't think the government should be arresting people for doing them.  I think drugs including tobacco & alcohol should be banned from public stores.  It shouldn't be illegal. If it is illegal where you arrest anybody who does pot then that just causes more problems.  So here is the answer: legalize pot & other illegal drugs but ban them, tobacco & alcohol from public stores.

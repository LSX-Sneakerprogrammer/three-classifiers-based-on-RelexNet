Very  very  good argument. Stav, you are favored and friended for this.   I still hold a conservative view towards it though. I don't mind the people doing it illegality, in fact the legality of it (or almost anything else for that matter) has little to do with my opinion.   For those who are almost  blindly  opposing because of their fear of change or the likes, would find this post to be extremely helpful. I wish I could double vote you up.

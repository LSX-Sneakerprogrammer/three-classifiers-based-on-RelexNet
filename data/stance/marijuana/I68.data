well i do see how you could perceive cannabis use as a "cop-out" or a way to escape life, but with me it only motivates me to go to work, in high school it made study more, and generally just gives me that drive to enjoy life. How can this be bad, honestly... the only derogatory thing it does to me is a bit of coughing, proven time and time again to be less harmful than any form of smoking tobacco(pipes, cigarettes, cigars, etc.). You said yourself you've never tried it, this may be a bit blunt for you...but how can you make any judgment on the subject without any experience in it whatsoever?!?

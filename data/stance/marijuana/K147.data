Even In Mexico, The cartel only has scared the law enforcment into not doing anything. If someone investigates a murder there head is choped off and sent to there office. Why, would we want that here in America. That would destroy our inalibe right to life and liberty . We could get killed in gang fights or worse if we partake in buying Cannabis then we can get killed for going to the the wrong person. I dont know about yall but I want to live.

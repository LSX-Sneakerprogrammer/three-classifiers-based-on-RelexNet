marijuance creates LACK of concentration, not an increase of concentration!   Marijuana is addicting, no matter what you say. If made legal, it will become a competitive market just like any other thing. (At least for those who don't grow it). That would mean there would still be [illegal] sellers, as they would be breeding more powerful strains to get more powerful amount of THC levels.   The more powerful it is the more addicting. Substance abuse is a health problem. We already have a huge health-care industry centered around alcohol/drug abuse. You want to add to the list?   The Tobacco Companies wait in anticipation so they can start packaging and selling to more idiots. That's right--I'm talking marijuana. No doubt they pay for studies to try to prove that marijuana is "harmless". They see big dollar signs, just like with tobacco.  The FDA would have to get involved to "put a limit" on "acceptable" drug levels. They would also have to enforce these rules, And just like with alcohol, they have to watch for "bootleg" sellers who try to sell dangerous products. Everyone will (still) want their piece of the pie.  Once legal and commercilized, competition will be fierce so at first the price will be low, but just like with gas, they will slowly squeeze you dry.

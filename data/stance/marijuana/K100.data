The question's not 'will the US ...' because we all know such a turnaround in policy won't happen so easily.  Also, out of interest, considering that that weed prices would be determined by Supply/Demand, if demand stays the same, and the cost of supply goes down, then wouldn't the optimum price be at most the same, or less? Supply/Demand does apply to dealers, there's way different costs around the world, so I don't really see any basis for the 'gunna cost so much' argument.

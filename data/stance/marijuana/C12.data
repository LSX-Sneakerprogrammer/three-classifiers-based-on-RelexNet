Way too many people are jailed for using the drug, which is something that some people need to escape from their own harsh realities. Marijuana should at least be decriminalized. Driving stoned, however, is something totally different and should definitely be a crime. Also, weed can't kill you, unlike cigarettes and alcohol. In my opinion cigarettes should definitely be completely illegal, but they're so ingrained into our culture that I highly doubt that is going to happen anytime soon.

Marijuana addicts are to "food addicts" as apple pie is to peach pie. with pie being a psychologically addicted person.  Its not the chemical substance people become addicted to.   The majority of the few health concerns with pot are eliminated with vaporizers. .Vaporizers should receive some type of stimulus with cannabis legalization to encourage production of more affordable ones and increased demand for them, this could be payed back by taxation of a larger market, with more producers, distributors, retailers and consumers.

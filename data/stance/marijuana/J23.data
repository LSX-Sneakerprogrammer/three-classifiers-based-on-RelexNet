What's bad about marijuana is that you have to burn it in order to get the best high. The burning part is what causes health problems less in danger than smoking tobacco.  Marijuana is totally healthy and science proved that the old crap used to be told on TV and newspaper is just not true. It does not produce violence (exactly the opposite), it does not kill brain cells at all, and it does not make you insane.

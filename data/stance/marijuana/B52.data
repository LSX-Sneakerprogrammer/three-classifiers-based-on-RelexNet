Marijuana destroys the brain you forgot to mention that part.     You may want to check your facts:   http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/                                       20030701/ heavy-marijuana-use-doesnt-damage-brain    Also, I noted a possible study which may have gave you your impression:   http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/ 2009/02/090202175105.htm    I find it suspicious because of the small sample size (14 people) and the influence of alcohol on 5 of them.

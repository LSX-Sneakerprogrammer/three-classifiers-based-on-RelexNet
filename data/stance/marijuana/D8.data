Laws aren't really doing anything to stop cannabis consumption, anyway. If you legalized, you could tax it too. Sure, legalize marijuana. But that's not the problem, is it?  But I am personally against recreational drug use. Why is life so boring that one requires external stimulants? Unless restricted live in a cell forever and the like, it's always possible go something with your life. Society didn't spend all those years on people, raising them, feeding them, just to waste resources.

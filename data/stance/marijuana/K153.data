&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;----------------------- ----------------         WRONG SIDE          *  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;----------------------- -----------------   Oh yes, because you don't want to live in a world like that, no one else should! How dare anyone else want to do something that you disagree with! What a terrible crime! And did you know that if it was legalized, it could be easily grown in any house that has electricity and water?!!?! Good thing we don't have to tax things we make ourselves. I love pot, but think meth is a terrible thing. But I'm not gonna tell anyone they can't smoke pot or do meth because I don't like it. That's what an ignorant person as yourself would want. And also, maybe if we legalized weed which has less health problems as opposed to cigs and alcohol, we wouldn't have to legalize meth, because it has shown it's devastating to your health. If we legalize weed, you don't HAVE to legalize other drugs moron.    Your argument has failed my friend.

if we legalize pot there wil be a sharp increase in demand and consumption over a period of time then............it will start to decline....slowly at first until smoking pot becomes drinking wine.......only on special occasions...........that's why we should continue the war it's not like weed is damn near impossible to obtain......in my opinion there is no war.......there never was...

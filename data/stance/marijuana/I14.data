So as humans evolve, the way we do things and the way we think about things evolve as well creating something.... different (not necessarily better or worse but with a different set of pluses and minuses) . And since we are not entirely sure we know the entire set of pluses and minuses (due to the fact that it is new) we can't assign a value to those pluses and minuses thus we can't be sure if it's better or not. This uncertainty creates fear and fear holds us back from moving forward. But this fear is not necessarily bad because it may be keeping us from moving forward into quicksand. I guess in the end we wont really know until we try it. Lets send some scouts to pioneer the way.

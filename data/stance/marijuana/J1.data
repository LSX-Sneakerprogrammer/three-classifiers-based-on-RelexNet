I hate Marijuana.  But it should be legal. Just like alcohol and tobacco and fast food etc. (things that are bad for you that I also don't like, accept fast food (; )are legal.   Especially when alcohol is the stuff that actually makes people aggressive and ruins families and can lead to abuse. If   anything  is gunna be illegal, make it alcohol.   And no I don't think It will do wonders for the economy.

Ok that is fine, good explanations. But if they legalize weed and see how much of a problem it becomes then make it illegal again, it will only make things worse. Remember prohibition? I've never done any drugs myself, sure I've drank my share of alcohol and I'm not even of age to do so, but I'm not a drunk. And I wasn't calling you a pothead, I was saying it in general. I just feel it'll cause more problems in the long run with people becoming "addicted" to it and needing help to get off of it. And as far as it goes for medicinal purposes, marijuana does not cure anything in which many people try and use that excuse because they think it does. It is for the sole purpose of numbing the pain in cancer patients in which they can switch to other alternatives and also making patients hungry so they eat more and gain weight on their sick bodies.

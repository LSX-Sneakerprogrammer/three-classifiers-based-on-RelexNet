heck yea it should. people are gonna do it anyways and all this is doing is putting people in jail and this could actually create more jobs =P. but it should be limited, like alcohol: no drinking and driving, must be sober to work etc. so yea, absolutely it should be legal. like gay marriage. are they afraid of a lack of babies? this world is over populated already. we don't have the resources to sustain our rapidly growing population. i hate to say this but we should also legalize suicide.

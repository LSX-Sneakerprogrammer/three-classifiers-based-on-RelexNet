Yes.   Unfortunately, President Obama has lied to us all. He says that he's willing to keep government open and address issues that we find the most important. So far, the number one concern brought up by the internet is the legalization of marijuana, and every time he finds a way to dodge it. The largest petition on his website and they basically tell us that they're going to do nothing and will not give us a straight answer on why.  Obama reminds me of Reagan, except that Reagan just didn't like weed and never said that he would address our concerns when we brought them up (especially in such numbers).   No, more like Nixon, a liar who thinks that the president should have far more powers than delegated by the Constitution.  Okay, a rant about Obama. I feel like I need to get my negative feelings out every once in a while in small numbers (as opposed to just being objective all the time). And since weed has been brought up on this site so many times, why not this debate?

First, have you smoked weed? Have you done acid? Do you play an instrument? Scholarly resources can only tell you so much about the drugs and how they affect people.   I'm saying that during jazz's first creative explosion, weed was a major factor in the community. And yes, lowered stress is an excellent way to make better music. I'm assuming you haven't smoked weed before; it becomes pretty easy to imagine complete composition of a song in your head, compared to sobriety. While the effect of acid is more extreme in its increase of creativity, it's effect was narrow and short-lived on the music industry as a whole. Weed is the only drug done by every single segment of society.  Heroin is heroin. If anything, it held him back. I wasn't arguing for Ray Charles.

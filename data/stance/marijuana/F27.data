Marijuana has more of an addiction effect than alcohol does.   Whoa! Now that is just not true. Have you consumed both? When I was younger I smoked daily for years... one day I decided I was wasting money and was tired of sitting around and staring so I just quit. There was  NO  addiction at all in my case. I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest marijuana is more addicting than alcohol.

I used to be a stoner. I have scoliosis also and have had muscle relaxing injections.  They made me more uncomfortable and took 6 months to wear off. And too much pain killers makes you constipated , which is never good for a bad back.  Getting high would work wonders until coming down , then as my body would get negged my back muscles would hurt more.  But , however my grandfather , when questioned as to why he had a 6ft mull plant in his yard , answered that he ate the seeds to relieve headache.  I dont know .  But i do know that its only a gateway to other drugs , depending on the enviroment of and the willpower or lack thereof of the individual.  Drugs are readily available in just about any city or suburb or country , not everybody takes them .  And even if they do smoke pot , it may be only occasionally and or they may detest the use of other drugs.

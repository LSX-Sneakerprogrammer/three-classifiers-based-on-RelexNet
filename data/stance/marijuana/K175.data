actualy not really... all you need to brew beer is a few containers.. in fact you can buy a beer brewing kit for roughly $30... although yes you can purchase more expensive setups... the same goes for marijuana... Really all you need to grow weed is the ground (because its natural, not man made like alcohol) but if you want to spend more you could spend thousands on hydro systems

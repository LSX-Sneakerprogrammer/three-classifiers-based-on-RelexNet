What is your problem with the Herb anyway   The way it effects the brain and mental system.   you agree it is better than a lot of what is Legal already   No, I agreed that in  some  cases there are drugs that have more severe effects (ultimately it depends on the amount consumed and the at the frequency it is consumed).   why should it be illegal for someone who wants to get to get stoned on Marijuana to unwind but OK for them to get drunk which has a lot more health issues connected   Moderation. Marijuana has more of an addiction effect than alcohol does.

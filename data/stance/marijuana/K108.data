I'm your personal reference and no matter who studies it it doesn't get any better or worse by having personal experience. It's what I KNOW and what I witnessed. The 70's have come and gone but that means nothing. Where do you get your pot from? Who broke it down? Who laced and cut it? Year in year out it's the same killswitch. I agree with your 2nd portion absolutely but not the 1st or 3rd. Did you not read the link I gave?.

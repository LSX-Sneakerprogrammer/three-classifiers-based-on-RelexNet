I don't think that it should be legalized but at the same time I think that it should be decriminalized.    The drug, or all drugs for that matter, have an effect on society. It's not just about the individuals safety. We already have tobacco and alcohol, if we make either illegal there will be a riot, jobs will be lost and so on. If we add another drug to the legal market, that's just another way to waste time.    People in this country act like everyone owes them something, like their 8 hour shift at work is all that is expected of them and that's all that they have to do. Anything more is a waste of their time because they could be spending it doing something that they want to do. Sure, that's the American dream. Work, go home and plan your next vacation, maybe sit back and relax with a beer. Watch television and talk about the "good ol times" with your buddy... That's a societal waste though. Anytime you sit back you're wasting time, like I am right now, and you, reading this (I'm using cognitive processes to contribute to an idea that other people can read, appreciate, or better, disagree with, so technically neither you nor I are really wasting time, but you and I could be doing better).    Basically society is constantly rotting under our feet, and all these people want to do while it's happening is get high, drunk, or take a cigarette break! There is work to be done, quite your bitching and get to it.

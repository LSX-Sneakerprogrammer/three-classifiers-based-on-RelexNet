You cannot say that because you'd rather not, it shouldn't be legalized. I agree though, for some odd reason (and I've put way more thought into the issue than I apparently should have) don't like the idea of legalization. Then again, I do know that once someone covets something, the first thing I want to do is keep it from them because I believe anything that is "coveted" cannot be a good thing for them...  Er, you can see my arguments... they aren't pretty :^/.  I don't know, I get the idea that this somehow has to do with morals or ethics, but it's only a feeling and when it comes down to it, my "practical" side says that it  should  be legalized, but still, I don't like people doing it... which is not the case with drinking.  So why do you think that people  shouldn't ?

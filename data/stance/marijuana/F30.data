If you meen short term cognitive thinking whilst stoned that is one suggestion but there is also a view that Marijuana can open the mind making you more responsive to stimuli some people enjoy music more when they have had a smoke but this is the same as alchohol there are many stories of people not thinking straight when drunk, Alchohol and Marijuana are peobably much the same when it comes to doing something stupid when wasted

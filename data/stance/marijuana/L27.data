Seriously! Who the hell would vote this down?! It is human nature to bitch and moan about what they don't like about where they are/live. Plus it is pointless to start a revolution about something banned for a reason! The reason mexicans are migrating to America is because we fucking rule! So like Altarion said: "If you don't agree with American law, then GTFO" OR STFU!

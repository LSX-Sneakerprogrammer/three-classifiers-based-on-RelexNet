Why do you assume if marijuana is legalized that everyone will start doing it habitually? You have nothing to back this view up and the history of prohibition would actually disagree with your statement.  "the fact of the matter is that if you smoke pot long enough your mind will strictly be wrapped around trying to get high."  Marijuana is not physically addictive. Yet one of the most addictive substances known, nicotine, is perfectly legal to have in cigarettes. Alcohol is also very illegal. There are thousands of deaths every year from tobacco and alcohol, yet there has never been a recorded death due to marijuana. Unless you support making cigarettes and alcohol illegal, your position is not logically consistent.  Furthermore your assumption that people who smoke pot are not productive members of society is simply not the case. 50% of the population has smoked marijuana at least one time. And the past three presidents have admitted to smoking pot. You can very easily be a very successful habitual smoker, but it is far more difficult to be a fully functional alcoholic. Yet once again I doubt you support prohibition of alcohol.  Your argument is based upon incorrect assumptions and contradictions. Try again.

Nobody knows the exact answer on this question. I think we should try to do it and then we will learn it will help or not. To talk on this topic right it or wrong is too early. I think we cannot judge about it until we actually use it on practice because who knows what will be in the future, maybe, what i've said before it is a solution for this problem!

No, no, no, no, no. Listen, I don't know how many times I've said this, in however many debates, but marijuana's legalisation would be a step in the right direction. To put the kabosh on pot would be a bad decision, it would fling us into the past, in one sense or another. America's economy would benefit from the sales, and people who are already addicted haven't anything to worry about! If people go out and fuck up their lives because they haven't enough self-control to smoke only on occasion, well, that isn't the government's problem.

No, I've had first hand experience of what it's like to be around people smoking marijuana. It's a bad pungent odor that can be smelled several yards away. I mean when you can smell someone smoking marijuana from down the street, it's a social issue. In time even the smell gives me a bad headache. Maybe it's in my head, but none of you have the right to put me through that just so that you can say you can get baked legally.  At least cigars and cigarettes odors dissipate fairly quickly, and their odor, while somewhat bad, are not sharp bad pungent odors that carry down the street and waft through people's windows.  Geez, I can't even have my window open sometimes on a warm summer night or a decent time in my backyard on a Friday night because of my next door neighbor who doesn't seem to care that the odor is very strong across the fence in my yard.  It's ridiculous really. Not to mention, with all the problems we have with the mind-altering substance called alcohol, we'd be opening a whole new host of problems if marijuana were legalized, not to mention the public health concern. I know, I know, Marijuana only alters the mind and it has no harmful fumes, yeah, well, wait until it goes public and it's everywhere, I think we'll find, as we do with almost everything, it's not what we assumed it would be. We may even find it's not as safe as we thought. And imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.   I have no issues with it being legalized for people to do on their own, away from the public, but that's not what will happen is it. No, what will happen is people will test their boundaries, insist that it can be smoked anywhere regardless of who is affected by it, and that will go on for a while until it's finally brought to court, and years later legislation is finally made that says it can't be smoked in public places or where it causes other discomfort. Then people will fight that saying that there are not harmful side-effects, if in fact we don't discover any, which we won't at first, and they will attempt to smoke it in places where others are affected by it anyway.   And then we've proven how responsible we are with legal mind-altering substances by how we use alcohol. Some of us are while many others of us are not, and really, to legalize marijuana would mean a whole new era of legislation to control everyone that would not regard others in their use of the substance. At least now, they have to regard others or risk having the police called on them.

When all else fails, lol...    "So... you never liked candy as a kid?"   True, I'm not and have never been a fan of candy.   "Or Chocolate?"   I'm not a fan of chocolate either.   "Or Soda"   Anything containing High Fructose Corn Syrup is prohibited.   "Have you ever eaten an expensive meal?"   Why, is there a place where I can eat for free?   "You never drank tea at the end of a long day to help you relax?   No, tea contains caffein, I don't drink caffein to relax at the end of the day because I sleep at the end of a long day.   "Nothing!?"   True, none of the above.  You highly doubt it now, but wait till you smoke another joint, maybe that'll expand your mind enough to allow such an amazing idea to seem plausible. No, I'm not "mad" as in angry, I'm almost never angry, and I'm especially not angry about other people getting "special privileges" like a high.   Yeah, I am lame, arrogant, and hypocritical, but that only goes skin deep.   ;)

The Legalization of marijuana would lower are crime rates in the United States of America by at least 15 to 20%. A lot of the US citizens have either used, grew, or sold Marijuana and have gotten caught by the police if we legalized Marijuana we could put restrictions on the use growth and sells of marijuana so that he people who sell grow and use it can sell grow and use it just under certain restrictions. Thats my side for like, yeah man.

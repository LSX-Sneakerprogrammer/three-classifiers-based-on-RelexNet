1. why does each side have hundreds of points, but there are not arguements?  2. I'm glad you brought up this subject.   In the history of mankind, prohibition of any substance that one puts into their own body has never worked.  Alcohol was no more or less popular during prohibition, than now. The only difference was that instead of States and the feds recieving tons of tax dollars, and the money from alcohol purchase going into the hands of legitimate businesses that employed citizens who contributed to society and paid taxes,  all the money was going to gangsters and thugs.  Well, the same thing is going on now. Marijuana was not made illegal until 1937. Before then the plant was taxed. It employed people. Now it is not taxed, and those who sell it are usually criminals of some sort (though many are harmless)  Still, the amount of marijuana consumed has not diminished one bit.  Cannabis has been used all through recorded history.   link    What makes us think that now, in the last 72 years something about the plant has changed.  Marijuana's illegal status is a historical farce. It's laughable, pointless, and counter productive.  1. Marijuana is a better pain killer, with less harmful side effects than any perscription drug. It costs less (0 if you have dirt and water already) and it's less addictive.  Are there harmful side effects of marijuana? Yes, but no more so than any other drug including alcohol, tobacco, or caffiene.   2. Taxes collected from the sale of marijuana would be in the hundreds of millions, it would give our economy an enourmous boost and employ potentially hundreds of thousands of people.  3. It would take the money from illegal drugs  out of  the hands of criminals.  4. It would be a huge relief on our overcrowded prisons, saving States hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, even millions in States with large prison populations like CA. Also, it would save the 18 year old A student and college hopeful from losing all his scholarships and having to check  YES  on every application that asks if they've ever been arrested, for the rest of his or her life, just because they had a tiny amount of a plant that is far safer than alcohol.  and by all means, come visit my blog sometime, www.crazydrugnews.blogspot.com.

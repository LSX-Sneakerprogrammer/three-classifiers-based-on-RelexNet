I don't think legalizing pot would be an end to the war and damn the day I see the war on drugs end. Drug abuse kills people all the time, screws them up, messes with their faces, gets people killed, infests the country with greed. Why the hell should we let that run rampant?  I have my dictator's hat on tonight. :D!

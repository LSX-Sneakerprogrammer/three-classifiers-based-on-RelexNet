Common sense does. Have you ever seen people do stupid things while under the influence of marijuana?   So in other words, you have no idea, but simply think that it would? Your "common sense" is based on assumption. And Common sense is often wrong for this reason.  Marijuana causes lethargy, which greatly decreases "dangerous activities". Someone who is high on Marijuana is not going to rob a bank, or steal a car, however there is a good chance they will sit on the couch and stare in amazement as a piece of lint floats by, or watch a movie about talking animals.   But for the sake of argument lets say it doesn't cause any harmful mind altering effects (which I'm sure you'll argue next).   Heavy long term usage can impair short-term memory, outside of that there really isn't any. Drinking bleach isn't all that good, yet it is not illegal.    Do you know of anyone who has been fired for marijuana use?   Not personally, no.   There's a lot of companies that would fire people for that even if it wasn't illegal.   SO???  A lot of companies will fire people for showing up late to work, should that be illegal?   When people don't have an income, they get desperate, especially when they want more money for their next fix. Desperate people do desperate (and often illegal) things.   {Laughs!}  Their "fix"?  {Laughs some more}  Thank you for demonstrating you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. The sad thing is that a lot of people don't know why that's so funny. We aren't talking about heroine here, we're talking about weed. There's no such thing as a marijuana "fix". Marijuana is not addictive. People DONT go through marijuana withdraws, people can go through caffeine withdraws. Marijuana is less addictive than caffeine, which is why your statement that they "need to get their fix" is incredibly asinine. You obviously don't know anything about marijuana, which is funny because you want it to be illegal.  Let me further demonstrate why this statement is idiotic.  Desperate people, will sometimes do desperate (and often illegal) things, such as stealing a car....therefore we should outlaw cars. Following your logic.  Prohibition obviously doesn't work, which is why so many people still do marijuana, many people are sitting behind bars (costing taxpayer dollars) who should not be there in the first place. Marijuana does not hurt anybody.  I don't even like marijuana, but I can't think of a single good reason for it to be illegal.

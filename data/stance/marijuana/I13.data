A) It is already in process.  B) I wouldn't think about a gay revolution as passionately as I do with drugs and the freedom of thought because no one can stop you from picking your favorite hole to love, and marriage is over romanticized paper work, authorized love. So the real problem is elsewhere, I'd say jealousy, whatever that may be thought of as sacred in the whole marriage thing is the undergoing conversation with the hottest couple around Genesis.  And, you know, back then you needed a man and a woman, to make a baby.  Alternative ceremony should be considered, maybe some LSD.

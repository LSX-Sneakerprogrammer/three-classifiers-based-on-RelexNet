You may be right...but that's your belief, and you don't have the right to FORCE your belief on someone else. I have the right to go to work, put in my 8 hours, then go home and smoke it up, play with my kids, watch tv, or whatever else I wanna do that doesn't infringe on anyone elses rights. If I'm happy doing that, then who are you (or anyone else) to tell me I'm wrong? That is not just the "american dream"; that is the freedom that we fought for.

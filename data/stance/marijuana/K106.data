Why are there no arguments, unless this a trap? Oh well, the war on drugs is a stupid thing, its basically prohibition again, and that didn't turn out well. There are some bad drugs out there but drugs are a tool. Non-ordinary conciousness is still conciousness, albeit not clarity in most cases. But it is still the experience to learn from, I'm not saying go do meth and have an experience, no, soft drugs and hard drugs are two different things. Entheogens are great for spiritual experience, but they are like a stepping stone, and should be replaced by meditation, because meditation is the ultimate drug.

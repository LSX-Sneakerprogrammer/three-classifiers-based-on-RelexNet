Incorrect. Medical Marijuana can be prescribed for any number of things. Cancer patients are prescribed because it takes away the nausea that follow chemotherapy sessions which is extremely important to the recovery of the patient since if said patient can't eat from the chemo he'll stay weak and probably not survive. It's not because they are dying to ease the pain. Pot isn't that hardcore man.

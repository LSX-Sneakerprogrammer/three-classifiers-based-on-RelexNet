Regarding your first two points, I agree, but your point is irrelevant. Yes people do break the rules, and if they do they will be punished. We have laws against playing music too loud, but because people do it anyway, should we make playing music illegal?  Yes marijuana would be cheaper if legalized, you do not understand the way a black market works. Because the people growing, trafficking, and selling marijuana have to take huge risks, they make the price higher. Once legalized the price would lower. So your argument that there would be a blackmarket with cheaper prices is invalid.  Really the last thing we need as a country is more people doing marijuana? I can think of far worse things. Assuming that legalizing it would significantly increase use long term, which you don't have evidence for, what is the big deal? People do not end up at rehab for marijuana. It is not addictive. If they go to rehab it is because they have addictive personalities and are using it too much because of that, not because it is addicting. People with addictive personalities can need help for anything. Out of curiosity would you have slapped Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak when they created apple while smoking marijuana. Very intelligent and successful people habitually smoke marijuana. Just because unsuccessful gravitate toward toward it, does not mean it makes you unsuccessful. As we say in statistics, correlation does not imply causation.

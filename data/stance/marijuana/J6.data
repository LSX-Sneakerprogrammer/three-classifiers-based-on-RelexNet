Lol well, I think it's the other way around about the fast food thing. Almost impossible to like  marijuana  and not like  fast food . (;   About alcohol, I'm just saying it's crazy that weed is illegal and alcohol isn't. Doesn't necessarily mean it should be illegal. The government shouldn't worry about what we consume. But if I had to choose between alcohol and weed to be illegal I would choose alcohol for sure.   And I agree about the money it could make, I had that discussion with ReichPride and changed my mind.

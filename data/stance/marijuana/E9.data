How would that help? You'd still have marijuana as a illegal drug and the most significant deterrents against its use would be removed. Instead we should legalize marijuana and put heavy taxes on it, similar to those levied on Alcohol and Tobacco. Of course then we'd still have to find a way to regulate the import, a task possibly as difficult as preventing marijuana use altogether for many of the same reasons.

Legalizing pot alone would not end the war on drugs. It would help, but it would do very little to the biggest of our problems on the war, and that is, our organized crime. Our big time criminals, the Mafia's, none of this small time dealers we've got going on with pot (and when I say small time, I'm more referring to the type of criminal activity that goes on with in these drug organizations), my personal opinion would be the only way to completely end the war on drugs would be to legalize everything. This sounds absurd, I know, but think of the lives saved by doing this. Underground sex trades, the biggest Mafia's in the world, petty cold criminals- they're all run by drugs. In other words, its the law thats allowing these criminals to be what they are. If there were no law against drugs, if all drugs were run through a license, and sold legally, there would be a whole hell of a lot less murders, theft, prostitution, spreading of disease, deaths, and for most, it would shut down the worlds biggest criminal operations which thrive on selling illegal drugs. I'm aware this will never, ever happen... but it's worth a thought.

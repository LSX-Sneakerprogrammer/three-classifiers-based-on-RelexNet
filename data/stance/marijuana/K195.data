" Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage. Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal. "  Yes, alcohol does cause brain damage- in minors. As we mature, our neurons deposit a compound called myelin around the axon of a dendrite. These myelin deposits are known as Schwann cells and their purpose is to make transmitting information quicker. Electrical impulses simply skip over these sections and go from node to node much quicker than if they weren't there. That's why it is illegal up until 21, when this stage of development has stopped and cannot be harmed any longer.  Truth is, smoking  anything  is bad for you. The only difference is that marijuana smoke has way more carbon monoxide. Inhaling this will limit the amount of oxygen that can go to your brain and can kill brain cells if they do not get enough oxygen. It could also cause other parts of the body to not get enough oxygen, like the muscles and the heart. This is why when people are high, they slow down.  And no, cigarette smoking has not been scientifically proven. The only way to prove this would be to formulate an experiment where you assign X amount of people to smoke 10 packs a day or whatever and X amount of people to smoke nothing for 20 years and get back to them to compare results. This is an unethical experiment and cannot be done since one part of the study could lead to death. (I took a stats course and we discussed this in depth for a day.)  And the website was about tobacco smoke. I knew that. But I deliberately pointed out that it mentioned how carbon monoxide can harm the blood vessels, which is present in marijuana smoke as well.

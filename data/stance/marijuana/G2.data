Of course it should, it's less harmful than Alcohol or Ambien.   What's good is that more and more politicians are supporting the idea of a debate on the issue (well, Arnold Schwarzaneggar is the most vocal right now). He doesn't say legalize it, but he does believe it's time to look into the situation and see if it should be legalized. Way better than pussy ass Obama who won't even discuss the reasons why he's against legalizing it. All he says is "that's not gonna happen". Maybe we should have gotten rid of that Born in America thing and voted in The Governator.

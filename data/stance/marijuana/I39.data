I'm definitely for the legalization of marijuana, but there's something people need to realize.  Just like with Tobacco, when Cannabis is legalized and FDA regulated, I can promise you the commercialized Marijuana product will be just as laden with polutants, chemicals and pure garbage as cigarettes are. It will become more expensive because there will be a tax on it, just as there is with tobacco and alcohol. It will become another government controlled commodity.   That's why it's not legal.   People die from drinking home made alcohol/moonshine. That has to be regulated, period. Tobacco isn't addictive and isn't as satisfying or nerve calming without all the additives, hence it's alteration from natural form.   Marijuana is grown in backyards all over the world and needs no alteration from government entities for it to be popular or effective. There's no logical way for the United States government to intervene, control and PROFIT (key words here) from the potential Marijuana industry.

That's why weed should be legalized so we can control what goes into it and what it is cut with. Weed on its own isn't too bad (apart from obviously the effects of smoking it on your lungs), it is the shit that dealers put into it to bulk it up to make more money that effects people.   I have to agree with your last comment though. You should never think weed, cigarettes or alcohol are totally harmless.

I have always felt that it should be DECRIMINALIZED. Some states (like Texas) treat it as bad as homicide. At worst, it should be a fine for quantities over a few ounces.   I know better than to presume it would ever be "legal" but certainly we waste boatloads of tax dollars worrying about this silly drug when we should be concerned about rapists, crack dealers, and corrupt politicians.

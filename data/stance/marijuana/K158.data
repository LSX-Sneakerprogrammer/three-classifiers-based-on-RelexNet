Actually, I've smoked marijuana before and I never wanted to do it again. Sure, that's just me but come on. Are you really telling me that people who don't do it NOW are going to do it if it's legalized? If someone wants to do it, they're going to do it whether or not it's legal (proof is everyone smoking pot today). Anyways, how many people do you know to smoke pot? From the sound of it, everyone must, because you're saying that EVERYONE will be hooked on the stuff if it becomes legalized. I don't think that many people (including the person or people that will, 'cure cancer') want to waste their time smoking it. This is strictly from my point of view, and I'm only pointing out that there is a vast majority of people who do not smoke now. What does that mean? There will be (HOPEFULLY!) a vast majority of people who don't smoke, if and when marijuana becomes legalized. Just because a lot of people drink doesn't mean everyone does. Just because a lot of people smoke cigarettes doesn't mean every person does. And just because a lot of people overeat certainly does not mean that everyone does. Consider athletes, for example. I'm not so sure that if it actually is legalized everything will be perfect, but then again nothing is, really. If one looks at alcohol there is still a giant reoccuring problem with drinking and driving. Despite educational tools used in schools, teens still do it; even adults do. There will always be people who think they are capable of doing something they are clearly not.

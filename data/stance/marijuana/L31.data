I'd love to see where your facts come from, because every medical journal i've ever read (including the British government) have said that pot is LESS HARMFUL than alcohol.  Just do a google search and you'll find plenty of proof to show that.  It's also obvious you've never smoked pot. I know plenty of potheads, and none of them "stopped caring about their lives and only wanted to get high".  You are obviously confusing pot or crack or heroin.

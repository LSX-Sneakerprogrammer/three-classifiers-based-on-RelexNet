Marijuana should definitely be legalized. Tobacco is much more harmful to the human body yet the government bows down to the needs of "Big Tobacco". The government spends so much money on the "War on Drugs" and yet doesn't realize if they just legalized marijuana they could start taxing it and collecting a ton of money that could be put to better purposes, such as fixing health care or Social Security.

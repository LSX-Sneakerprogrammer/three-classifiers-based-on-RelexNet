Agree completely, the way the law is it has ruined so many peoples lives with jail time and criminal records with overly harsh and excessive mandatory sentences. Its just insane. It doesn't really hurt anyone, alcohol is far worse, yet when people tried to stop that with prohibition, it didn't work at all. It seems we haven't learned our lesson from our own recent history. So sad and tragic, because it was completely preventable. Be wise Legalize.

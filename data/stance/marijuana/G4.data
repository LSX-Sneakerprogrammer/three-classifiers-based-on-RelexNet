Like the studies claiming to show damage to the reproductive system, this myth is based on studies where animals were given extremely high-in many cases, near-lethal-doses of cannabinoids. These results have never been duplicated in human beings. Interestingly, two studies done in 1978 and one done in 1988 showed that hashish and marijuana may have actually stimulated the immune system in the people studied.  Marijuana is much more dangerous than tobacco?   Smoked marijuana contains about the same amount of carcinogens as does an equivalent amount of tobacco. It should be remembered, however, that a heavy tobacco smoker consumes much more tobacco than a heavy marijuana smoker consumes marijuana. This is because smoked tobacco, with a 90% addiction rate, is the most addictive of all drugs while marijuana is less addictive than caffeine; like soda or coffee. Two other factors are important. The first is that paraphernalia laws directed against marijuana users make it difficult to smoke safely. These laws make water pipes and bongs, which filter some of the carcinogens out of the smoke, illegal and, hence, unavailable. The second is that, if marijuana were legal, it would be more economical to have cannabis drinks like bhang (a traditional drink in the Middle East) or tea which are totally non-carcinogenic. This is in stark contrast with "smokeless" tobacco products like snuff which can cause cancer of the mouth and throat. When all of these facts are taken together, it can be clearly seen that the reverse is true: marijuana is much SAFER than tobacco, that's a fact.   Is there are over a thousand chemicals in marijuana smoke?  Again, true but misleading. The 31 August 1990 issue of the magazine Science notes that of the over 800 volatile chemicals present in roasted COFFEE, only 21 have actually been tested on animals and 16 of these cause cancer in rodents. Yet, coffee remains legal and is generally considered fairly safe.   . NATURE OF MARIJUANA: Marijuana (derived from the Cannabis sativa plant) is not a pure, single-chemical substance. Marijuana is a complex, unstable mixture of over four hundred chemicals that, when smoked, produce over two thousand chemicals.   Is there a thousand chemicals in a cup of coffee?  Yes! Scientists have identified over 1,000 different chemicals in a cup of coffee. But how many of the 1,000 or more chemicals have been tested in animal cancer studies? Only 22--leaving 978 compounds in your morning java about which we know very little. And of those 22 that were tested, were any found to be carcinogens, or cancer-causing compounds? Seventeen of the 22 are, in fact, carcinogens. Also when you roast your cup of coffee the chemicals get in bigger numbers to over 1,500 chemicals in a signal cup of coffee. Think about that in the morning, when your getting your hot cup of coffee.  So coffee can be just as bad and good as weed or marijuana. So even that I don't smoke it at all. I supported because its has no reports of deaths just like coffee and also that it helps people stress, which is a big factor in this country. Which stress can cause health problems to the heart and body. Its also cuts down or burns of body fats to become thinner in a safer way then tobacco and lose weight pills/drugs that can hurt you that could case death faster, when there is no record death ever in marijuana. This is another way to have a healthy way to live for the thousands or millions can used marijuana to help them. So people that disagree about this; please know you facts before you go say something that you have no clue what you are talking about, when a specially I go to college and learn something new everyday.  Thank you for your time.

First of all, making blanket statements about an entire group of people (that includes our President) makes YOU an idiot. Secondly, if it were completely legal, priced and taxed similar to tobacco (which is HEAVILY taxed), it would be a drop in the bucket. I would love to pay for pot what tobacco smokers pay for tobacco.  Currently, obviously, cannabis is illegal. Currently, also, cannabis is a gateway drug because the same people that end up handling it, handle other hard core drugs. If it were legal, those people would have no desire to traffic marijuana because there would be no underground market (like there is no underground market for tobacco and alcohol). Therefore, marijuana would no longer be a gateway drug.  Making the argument that marijuana legalization would lead to Meth legalization, and THATS why we shouldn't legalize is pretty poor. Especially considering you have no references or evidence.

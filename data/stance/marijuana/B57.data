Everyone has different body chemistry.   Example, there was once a man who lived to the age of 115 off of nothing in his last 20 years but raw pork and gallons of red wine.   Another example: Some people under the influence of marijuana have increased motor control, increased focus, increased efficiency in memory, etc; and some people experience these things WITHOUT experiencing anything bad either.   Inevitable point: If you don't like the health risk of Mary Jane, don't smoke it. But when you jail hundreds, maybe thousands, of people a year for smoking a drug that is harmless in comparison to alcohol and tobacco, then your laws have a serious problem.   Illegal marijuana is as inefficient as Prohibition. The difference is that the punishment is worse, and the drug is far less dangerous.   I would argue that marijuana should be illegal as long as all other drugs are illegal, but then again, marijuana has actually treated people with anorexia and helped other people with loss of appetite. What does alcohol do that helps when you ingest it? Nothing. It helps when you swab it on an open wound, but then again, why ingest such a thing? A thing so rancid it kills bacteria automatically?   The answer is that people just do. Prohibition proved that people always will, no matter what any government tries to do. Instead of jailing people, it should be legal, and taxed, and controlled by the government so that it doesn't somehow contribute to killing people.  Then maybe one day, the government will be able to stop tobacco and alcohol companies from killing people to.

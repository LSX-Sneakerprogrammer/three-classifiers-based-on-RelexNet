If we legalize marijuana, it will make our economy worse than it is. With the adults that now think it'll be okay to do it, they will possibly become addicted. With that addiction, they will spend money they don't have on it. Then they won't be able to pay bills, get groceries, or do everyday things. This is just a thought, it's not my full opinion, but this is flowing through my mind. Part of me is saying yes, yet, the other part is saying no. It's a split decision for me.

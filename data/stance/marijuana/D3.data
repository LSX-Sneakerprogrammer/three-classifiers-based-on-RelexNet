Marijuana is, relatively speaking, an extremely safe drug which also offers numerable benefits, including to those who are suffering from the effects of cancer treatment. The war on drugs has failed to substantially sway people from using the drug, which is now far cheaper than it was thirty-five years ago. Furthermore, what one person wishes to ingest is the business of that one person, and nobody else.  My primary problem with the legalization idea is that, as soon as the government gets their hands on such a bountiful supply of income, they shall go  tax-happy  and skyrocket the price.

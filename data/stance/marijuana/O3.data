Yes, I find it interesting that everything you've said are things that I agree with, and I find it interesting that I've done a LOT of research on it, yet before I did the research, my opinion was the same as the guy you're disputing.  It is interesting how a lack of knowledge about a topic requiring knowledge, rather than keeping people away, actually draws people in.  If you are not interested in smoking the reefer, then don't smoke it. If you do not enjoy greek plays, then do not learn greek and do not go to greek plays with your uninformed and antagonistic opinion.  I, however love greek plays and even though greek plays do upset some people, there are much worse problems in the world.  For one, why does the government outlaw a plant, but it doesn't outlaw war?  In fact, why does the government SUPPORT war?  What is war? Killing.  Perhaps one should questions your government's motives before blindly obeying.

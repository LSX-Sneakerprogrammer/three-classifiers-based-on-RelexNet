I really dont care what you think is morally wrong... There is nothing wrong with having a beer or smoking a bowl on the weekend.... Millions of americans and billions of people world wide enjoy the consumption of alcohol... If you dont like drugs then dont use them, but what gives you the right to tell me that I am wrong. Last time i checked you are nobody

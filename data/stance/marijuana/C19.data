sorry how understand this "it is better for you than cigarettes.." It was not and will not be better than cigarettes and alcohol. it is enough that we breathe. Legalization is the easiest way to solve the problem, not the case. I assure you. I had long been prohibited and smoking and everything else that poisons our lives. And life is difficult without the marijuana. Can not we just enjoy life without all these... and about God ... God only wants us all check and, in general, he created and did not say for what ....

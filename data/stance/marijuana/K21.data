I know there is no point in complaining about down votes, but I just want to remind everyone especially the people who just down voted me that you are not supposed to do down vote arguments you disagree with. You are supposed to down vote arguments that are off topic or have shoddy logic. Whether not you agree with what I said, I don't think you can really say it is illogical or unsubstantiated by evidence. And if you do down vote, at least do me the courtesy of rebutting my argument.

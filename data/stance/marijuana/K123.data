"What does that mean about your natural state though, your worth as a human without it? "  Nothing wrong with using a medicine to get more work done.   "Honestly, I find it both morally and ethically corrupt to even desire a substance for pleasure"  So...you never liked candy as a kid? Or Chocolate? Or Soda? Have you ever eaten an expensive meal? You never drank tea at the end of a long day to help you relax? Nothing!?  I HIGHLY doubt this. You really are a hypocrite.  I bet your just mad because so many people get to smoke pot, party, have fun, and STILL be successful in life, school, etc. while your lame, arrogant, hypocritical ass sits at home because no one likes you.

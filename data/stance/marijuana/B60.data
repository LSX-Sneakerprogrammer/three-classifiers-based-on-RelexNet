It might be somewhat misleading to say it's not COMPLETELY addictive, but apparently so is fast food! Should we ban that as well? Because apparently the right combination of salt and sugar makes you addicted to fast food. I don't know, I saw that on Harry's Law (good show btw). But I think the more fundamental question is should we ban something because A. we don't like it and B. because it's bad for you? I should certainly hope not. Although I think the most compelling is the lack of deaths resulting from marijuana which has stayed consistent, 0.

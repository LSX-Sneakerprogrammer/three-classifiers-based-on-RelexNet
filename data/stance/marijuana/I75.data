I've already argued in favor of the legalization of marijuana, but there's one thing I forgot about. I watched "Severance" the other day, it's about a group of a European sales division of Palisade Defense are on a bus to a team-building weekend at a "luxury lodge" in the MÃ¡tra Mountains of Hungary. The team-building activities don't really work out till the they realize some wacko soviet soldiers are waiting in the woods to kill them one by one, only then they manage to form some sort of a group working together, helping each other, the survival of each is dependent on the survival of the team.  I figured that it might be a bit loose, but there is something about getting into drugs that brings back something that was lost during the arms race in the name of nape security. To illustrate - A few years ago I wrote a story about an alien civilization acting as if they were about to exterminate all humans, the aliens announced it on the news so a global panic was achieved, and nothing really happened, only that a feeling of survivalism boiled up everywhere, there was a greater power threatening from above, one intention over everyone, seeing all human kind as unified, ignoring our differences and difficulties with each other.  Later they said that the whole trick was to teach humanity a lesson about individualistic racing.

What about paranoia? This is a negative feeling caused by marijuana.... wait a minute.... it's a negative feeling because it is illegal. If it were legal, then you wouldn't be paranoid. Hang on, I think I heard the police at my door.... nope, must have been the wind. Anyway... what was I saying? Oh yeah, marijuana is harmful to your memory, that's a negative feeling / side effect. Does this make any sense?

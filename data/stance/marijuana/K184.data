Well he's only half black... ;)  Interracial marriage and suffrage rights did not and do not hurt anybody. The government realized these laws were wrong be cause they were denying certain people from something that honestly couldn't hurt anybody else. Smoking pot- smoking ANYTHING is harmful to your health. I honestly wish the public was taught more about cigarette smoke more. Hopefully, then the amount of smokers could go down without a ban.

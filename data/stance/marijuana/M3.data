Marijuana has been rated the least harmful drug in a study made in UK, which means that there is no less harm being done to people using the drug. Also, marijuana has evidence of pharmaceutical uses, such as treatment of glaucoma. Because marijuana can be addictive, the government could sell the drug with a high tax, which would shrink the number of users of marijuana, and at the same time, stimulate the economy with these high payments going to the government. Overall, as long people don't smoke marijuana (there are more ways to use marijuana outside of smoking it), legalizing marijuana would be beneficial.

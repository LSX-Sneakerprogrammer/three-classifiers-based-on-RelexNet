You oppose legal protection for unborn children.   And you  impose  it, whilst opposing that for the mother. In most developed countries, people have the option to choose what they want, not be told what they want and have it forced on them (or at least that's the idea).  You repeatedly fail to see how those supporting pro choice do not like abortion, they simply support the choice of it. Simply because it's bad doesn't mean it should be outlawed.  For example, all conflict is bad. But that doesn't mean that without conflict, we'll all be happy. Debate is a form of conflict, if instead of talking about issues would we be happier?

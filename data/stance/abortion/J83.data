In the end, it is a choice. And unless you are going to chain her wrists and ankles, she will get an abortion if she truly wants to.   I am a little bit of both. Hence, I am Pro-Both. However, that phrase implies that i am a "little" for each individually. Kinda funny...Pro-Both. I AM PRO-BOTH!!!! lol :D  Well. Anyway. If a woman gets rape, i believe she has a right to get an abortion if she wants to get an abortion. However, at the same time, my nerves are hit because an abortion is the killing of an unborn child. I don't care if it is dead or alive, the "thing" will soon be a child. And i find that unfair for the child but FAIR for the woman.   If an adult woman had CONSENSUAL sex, regardless if the pregnancy was an accident or not, the woman is still responsible. Don't be stupid. It seems retarded to say "oh the pregnancy was an accident." I say, "who cares. You had sex. You should had known better."   But what if we are talking about children? Or what if the woman didn't really know that unprotected sex leads to pregnancy? Ultimate stupidity is possible. That is a different story. I think it is FAIR for them to get an abortion but not FAIR for the child.

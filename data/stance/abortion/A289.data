I've just responded to this notion of potential life so I will answer your questionin in regard to respecting your point of view.   Your are free to hold it. Although I disagree with it strongly I would never use the force of law or anything to prevent you from holding it and expressing it, that is true tolerance.   However, ideas have consequences and some ideas are deadly. So I would say that some ideas are vastly superior to others. What Mother Teresa did was a superior idea than what jihadist are doing. But jihadist are human and therefore are valuable human beings worthy of dignity and respect. So as humans I respect them but it's their ideas that I don't respect. So all that to say that I'm egalitarian regarding persons and an elitist regarding ideas. So as a human I will treat you with dignity and respect but I can't say I will do that with all your ideas, only the ones that are good by objective standards.

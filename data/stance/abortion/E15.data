Personally, I feel that abortion should remain legal, or rather, parents should have the power to make the decision themselves and not face any legal hindrance of any form.  Let us take a look from the social perspective. If parents cannot afford to provide for the child, or if the family is facing financial constraints, it is thus understandable that abortion can remain as one of the options. The unborn child's suffering can be prevented; the family can have lesser burden. Problem of poverty can be reduced. Look at Africa.... ARGH I shall continue later :P

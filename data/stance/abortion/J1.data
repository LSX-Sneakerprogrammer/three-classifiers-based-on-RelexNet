It's definitely dishonest to present this as a picture of abortion in general, and sadly it preys on people who have no better source of information. Most women will not have abortions using this procedure, and their fetuses will not look at all like that. They probably will not even be recognizably human. If a woman went to a clinic, she would at least be told the truth about what would happen to her if she wanted an abortion.  However, D&E;is still in use today although it counts for a small fraction of all procedures. Abortions aren't pretty, no matter how they're done. If you are pro-choice, you may have to accept the fact that they are just tough for laypeople to look at, even suction aspiration. It's not at all a point in favor of pro-life; childbirth and open-heart surgery can turn stomachs, too.

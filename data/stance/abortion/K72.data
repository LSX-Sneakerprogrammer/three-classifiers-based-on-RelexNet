Has history not shown that Muslims and Jews approve of murder? Muslims with their Jihadi ways; Jews according to their own history books?   You're right, but if I said "Only Christians, etc." including those religions, I'd be dead right now with a note attached to the blade in my back saying "Allahu ahkbar!" Or, I'd be called an anti-Semite. Face it, Christians are the most acceptable target right now.   Rarely have I encountered a band of Christians planning on blowing up a building. It is even quite rare for Christians to kill abortion doctors.   But it still happens. Only religions like Christianity permit otherwise sensible people to commit these deeds.   You are generalizing a religion based on the warped acts of it's followers.   A religion is its followers.

I am totally against abortion because it is similar to killing. You'd better not have sex or at least used contraceptives ,if you are not planning to have a child at all. It doesn't matter in which period of time it's better to do abortion -3rd or 5th month ,anyways you are killing your own flesh and blood. Moreover,who says the child doesn't feel the pain? In fact,he feels really strong agony. Consequently,getting rid of the unborn child doesn't release you from huge moral standard's responsibility. Girls,please,be smarter,you don't want to have serious health problems in the future as well.    http://www.humanevents.com/2006/01/30/ abortion-causes-massive-mental-health- problems-for-women/

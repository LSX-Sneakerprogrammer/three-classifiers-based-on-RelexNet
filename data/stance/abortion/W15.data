In certain cases, I can see it as a necessity and a viable option. These cases are incest, rape, and endangerment to the mother's life. In almost all other cases, I don't see abortion as a responsible or a moral way to handle pregnancy. If a mother doesn't want a baby, her first step should be to use birth protection, whether it's a pill, surgery, or condom. If she doesn't use any precaution, then it's her fault for being irresponsible and she should carry the baby to term. Adoption is very successful and if she doesn't want to go through that, then she could always raise the baby anyway. Now if she uses protection in some form, but it fails, then she could always take a morning after pill, like Plan B. Pills like that safely "miscarry", for lack of better term, before the egg and sperm become fertilized. Other than that, she has no right to end a life. Sex is a wonderful thing, but people need to realize that it comes with consequences and responsibilities. Teenage girls can't just have sex with whomever and expect abortion to be there every time.

//It is a human embryo, which are living cells, just like you, except smaller, because you are made up of tiny cells.//  I lol'd when I read this. Haha..."except smaller". Believe me, an embryo is not similar to me at all just because cells are tiny! Here's the difference: VIABILITY! I can survive outside the uterus with a self-sustaining internal circulation, an embryo is underdeveloped to do that.  //If every unborn child voted, how would it go?//  Wow, we don't legally allow minors to vote, but let's ask the differentiated cells in an uterus to decide what the owner of the reproductive organ should do with her body, eh?

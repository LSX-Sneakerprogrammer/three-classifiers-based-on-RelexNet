Use your head for once and try to figure out the whole purpose of my argument.Who says you can't you use appeal to emtion or authority in debating?   Perhaps YOU need to use your head. Go re-read my comment and tell me exactly where I said you cannot use appeal to emotion/authority.  You can't, because I didn't. You're free to use them at your discretion. It's widely known that these are logical FALLACIES and can prove nothing but the ignorance of the person using them, but feel free to express this side of yourself through them anyway... =/  "And who says you also can't use different topics if they are similar in the point you are trying to make?"  Again, nobody has said this....  You do understand the difference between things that are similar and things that are related, don't you? ;)

Oh jeez,   I don't know where you and that J whatever guy came from, but your critical thinking skills are absolutely awful on this topic.  My point about the thousands of potential lives every time a guy cums are accurate.  There are thousands of sperm, each "potentially" able to make a life if it finds an egg. This is every time a guy cums. Look it up. There stored in you, if you don't jack it or screw they're dissolved in the body or come out in your sleep. But it's a sperm holocaust literally everyday within our bodies.  And I used that example to show J whatever exactly how silly the "potential" life argument is.  Potential life is not a legitimate excuse against abortion. Because, exactly... like... I... said... we destroy thousands of potential lives every single time we masturbate, or don't masturbate, or even when we do have sex.  Now, reread this twice if you feel a need to reply, and consult a dictionary if you have to, I'm tired of having to over-explain the simplest things.

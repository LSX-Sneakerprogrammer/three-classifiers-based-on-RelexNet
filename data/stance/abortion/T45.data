While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure. By going ahead with an abortion, you are denying someone, or atleast something life. Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.    It's a poetic argument but it's deeply irrational because the sentiment you employed isn't used for anything else in the world. Specifically I'm referring to the fact that the choices we make often deny others life in some obscure way. For example, assuming you live in the United States, by voting in leaders who continue to engage in war, you are enabling people in a far away country the right to life. But it gets worse, but refusing to lobby or protest for military action in Somalia you are allowing an area of the world to exist which destroys lives every second. How about poverty? How many people in the favelas in Brasil are being butchered as we speak and yet we're doing nothing?  Let's take the argument to its logical extremes. If you've ever used birth control, or engaged in any form of sexual act without procreation as the aim, you are destroying millions of cells that could have been a person. Suppose you only ever engaged in reproductive sex, what about spontaneous abortions that happen all the time and are not even noticed? How about our recent advances in biology, specifically genetic engineering and cloning. How much DNA have you destroyed that could have been cloned into another person?  The only point I'm trying to make is that although your argument is very kind in its intentions and poetic, it's too absolute to apply to life in this world. We have to recognise that lives can have priority. Sure a fetus could be a person, but the mother is already a person and her wants and needs outweigh a possible person. Sure, the starving and innocent in South America deserve support, but first we need to get our country better off so that we can afford the massive donations to infrastructure.

It's ironic that a woman can hire someone to kill her unborn, but should she do it herself, be charged with a crime. Why is this?   The fetus was once recognized as a person in our country but after 1973 it lost its identity and was put up on the chopping block, the bullseye was placed on every unborn fetus's forehead.   You talk about bodily sovereignty....I would assume you mean the right for a woman to abort at any time during the pregnancy since she certainly keeps her own body throughout the term. This means any woman because she has sole ownership of her body can decide what to do with it, even kill in the ninth month. Am I right? Is that what you are saying?  Pregnancy is not dangerous to 99% of those doing it. Less than 1% of ALL WOMEN getting abortions do it because of health issues. And in most case both mother and baby can be saved. So most woman abort because of social issues.   Having a baby is a natural thing to do. Many women do not even go to doctors to be watched and have no problems at all. So don't make the statement that it carries risks above and beyond what pregnancy implies. How many woman die a year in childbirth compared to those who have successful pregnancies? Not many.  You are saying two things in your statement. She owns her body, but she doesn't. Can she abort in the 9th month? NO..........but she should have the right to abort. Abortion kills. If that is what she wants to do, to kill it even in the ninth month, what right do you have then based on what you have said here.....to deny her the right?

How...as I said, less than 1% of all abortions happen because of danger to mother or baby.   That is unavoidably important. And hence, I'm trying to explain that abortions cannot just be tagged a crime. Sometimes they are important to be done.   Why are abortions important?    For the reasons above..   Or to the woman who is killing for social reasons?

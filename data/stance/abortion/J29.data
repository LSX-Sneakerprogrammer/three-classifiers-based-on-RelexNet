Yes I have. Abortion is wrong because it takes a life. The child in the raped woman's body…how is he/she at fault. Why should they lose their life because an act of violence happened to another living human being. Do you think two wrongs make a right? Rape was wrong….but abortion solves and takes away that problem? Its two acts of violence….the rape and the abortion.  Abortion is wrong whether the woman was raped or not.   If you think all life is sacred then how could I think less of the baby whose mother was raped?  Red Herring? It is fact and she has openly talked about her life. Should she have been aborted simply because she had shady relatives…or that they were poor?  Are you telling me that there are families that have not endured sadness, death, dying, troubles? Wow. Nothing bad happened to them. Incredible.   You skipped over cleverly my question let me reword it. Do you think that mentally challenged, physically challenged people should have been aborted? If it is known that they are not normal…and what is normal anyway…..should they be aborted? yes or no  You certainly don't like answering questions when your back is against the wall do you…lmao.  I will against ask the question……Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?  Your lack of an answer…speaks volumes. LOL

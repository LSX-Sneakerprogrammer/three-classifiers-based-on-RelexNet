1. What is your philosophical definition of life?  2. Yes it does. Go read any biology text book.  3. It's not an assumption, it's a deduction based off of the biological definition of life and its unique genetic code. I'll wait on your philosophical definition of life before commenting further.  4. Prevention of possible life is not murder, I agree. This goes back to defining what life is. Again I'll wait.

a spider is not human life therefore it is not as precious for it does not have a soul and i for one usually don't kill spiders unless they are of harm!     Nothing has a soul. We simply live. A spider has as much life as you and I.  We consider ourselves more precious because of our minds, and a foetus has no mind.

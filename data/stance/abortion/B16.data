1) And yet, half the people here were talking about how it's the woman's choice ONLY. The argument people ALWAYS make are that it's "the woman's body."  Interesting.  2) I actually can't agree with this. Rape is more iffy of course, but I don't think the child should have revenge taken out on them for being raped. The father who raped the women should suffer: not the child.  I somewhat understand that point, but I don't think it makes anything right.  I also think incest isn't much of a reason (Unless you're talking about the pedophillia related incest...) unless the women is AGAIN needing it for medical reasons. But consensual incest shouldn't equal death.  I don't condone incest, but it's a lesser evil to other things.  3) I can understand it if the baby has a deformity that WILL actually hurt them in the future.   5) the others; not much to argue I guess.

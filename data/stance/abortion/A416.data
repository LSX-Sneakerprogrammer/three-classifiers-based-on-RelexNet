Again with this "be thankful you were aborted" argument. If I was aborted it would not make one single difference. There'd be another baby. The world still exists, life goes on. This debate would still be raging and people would still be making the same arguments. Oh... but I won't be able to make MY arguments because I wouldn't be here??? Big deal! Someone else would make that argument for me. In fact, I'd be here as another person, arguing.

No, wit does not mean killing a child. It means killing a zygote that has no conscious thought. Arguments against abortion use scare tactics like killing cute babies in their mother's arms. This is not what abortion is. Abortion is an escape route for people who have no other choice but to not have a baby. You Kamranw forget the situation of the mother's death.   Also, yes a child that was born because of a traumatic indecent such as rape would be treated differently. Also, what about the mother's career or in some cases the mother's education. Should that be ruined because of the inability for this escape.

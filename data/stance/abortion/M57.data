Ok, this is my criticism of the argument for abortion from sapience:   The argument for abortion from sapience is a valid logical argument known as Barbra(or if your picky you can called it a variation of that argument) and is as follows  1.All non-(Human persons) are beings which do not have rights.  2.All fetuses are non-(human persons).  --------------------------------------- -------------------------   3.Therefore all fetuses are beings which do not have rights.   This is indeed Barbara (and a disjunctive syllogism):   1.All A are B  2.All C are A  --------------------------------------- --------------------------   3.All C are B  The soundness of this argument is completely dependent on the category of non-(human persons) which is dependent on the category of person.    This category is ill defined to start with but there are a few things that seems to be commonly agreed on:   1.A human person is a human being   2.A human person is a human being with the quality of personhood.   This forces us to look into personhood, so lets look into it:  1.Personhood is dependent on the brain,   A. How developed of a brain?    I. How is this decision decided or development measured? Likely by what functions the brain can accomplish, then the importance of those functions would have to be supported.   II. If the functions of the brain is what decides how developed of a brain then there is two options of approach which are as follows:   AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.   BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?  In less cases but in some the brains capability of some brain functions changes in the same way as the ability to demonstrate brain functions do.   Most brain functions change with time. If we base rights on most brain functions then the existence of any rights at all would be much much more volatile them they actually are.  Keeping all that in mind it seems clear that a human being also being a “human person” from birth to death is hypothetical, that human beings stop and start being “human persons” at times and still retain their rights. Also human beings which lack basic brain functions, such as babies( object permanence, for example. which many animals possess), possess rights. Thus the argument from sapience is unsound. Premise one is not true.  The truth value of premise two depends on the definition of personhood. The definition of personhood is arbitrary for it depends on a arbitrary selection of brain functions which are themselves usually ill defined and heavily dependent on subjective interpretation. thus you might as well make a reference to absurdity and say abortion is allowed simply because people say it is, no reason to give . This is because the argument from sapience is equivalent to doing such.  Jean piaget(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Jean_Piaget)  tells us that human beings don't begin to think logically about events and ideas till approximately age 7. We lack a sense of object permanence till around age 2. We also lack the ability to tell that if a object is stretch so that when its skinny there is not less of the object compared to how much was there when it was wider in-till we reach a later age. It would be difficult to consider anyone a “human person” with out the last 2 abilities.  Also i must mention, fetuses are simply human. There is no such thing as sub-human. The idea of sub-human is a horrible one. It suggests a hierarchy of organisms with humanity at the top, and because of humanities “superiority”(superiority according to what standard?) they are allowed the ability to do what would otherwise be dis-moral(which seems like a non-sequitur to me).

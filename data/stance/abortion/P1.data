Once again...  1. In all instances abortion is legal except extreme circumstance we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain.  2. Nowhere in the U.S. is abortion legal after the 3rd trimester unless that cluster of cells is known to have birth defects which will kill it or the mother upon birth (again despite christian harassment and even murder of abortion doctors and their bullshit pictures of babies being sucked into a vacuum they make up and spread online like a disease).  3. No one is forcing anyone to have an abortion. If one side is not forcing one to abort, what gives another a right to force another not to abort? If you don't want an abortion don't have one, and if you think it's a sin let god handle it, he's like all powerful or something right? He doesn't need your help asshole.  4. Making abortion illegal never in the history of the world has been shown to stop abortions from happening.  5. Making abortions illegal has been shown to force rape victims and young girls, many of whom are practically babies themselves, to seek dangerous means for having an abortion, resulting in more deaths. Basically in their self-righteous single-minded inability to feel the least bit of empathy for actual living women, amidst their floating misconceptions of what a fetus is, pro-lifers would actually kill more "people" than save.

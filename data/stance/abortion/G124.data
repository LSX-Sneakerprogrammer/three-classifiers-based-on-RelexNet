I was waiting for someone to bring up this point.  While some women may still have abortions, the abortion rate will definitely decrease by; it is my guess about 90% or even more. How many people would commit murder if it was legal, do you think? Obviously making something illegal is always a deterrent for a large amount of people.  That people will do it anyway is no argument to legalize something heinous. By the same token, should we legalize rape now so that no rapist will have to do it in secret, or because he would do it otherwise anyway?  Why should we abort a child because of mental retardation etc? In the same way should we kill a person because they are mentally ill?  When you talk about horrible process; what is more horrible being half awake whilst doctors are ripping your fetus out of you are giving birth to a life? What if a woman dies from abortion? You are talking as if carrying a pregnancy is more traumatic than doing an abortion. We are against abortion because we are talking about a life and as one professional once said it seems that those who supports abortion are the ones that are already born.  If a person is raped then give the baby up for adoption. There are other choices available. Don't make it seem as if abortion is the only way out.

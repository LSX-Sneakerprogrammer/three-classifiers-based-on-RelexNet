as science as stated time and time again.   Science doesn't "state" things. People who fancy themselves scientists observe things "scientifically" (hardyharhar) and make "conclusions" based on their own biases and pre-imagined fancies.    Do you call an acorn a tree? Why not?   I find this argument - which, happily, I have not run into very often - to be remarkably idiotic. Is the acorn the tree? Not yet, but once it has germinated, sure. Call it a sapling if you want. So far as I'm concerned, the embryo is akin to the germinated seed.   Do you call an egg a chicken? Why not?   Because it might actually be a raven?   A fetus is called just that for a reason   Well, my Latin dictionary says that  fetus  means "young" or "offspring", so I think that this is more convincing an argument for my case than it is for yours.   Your stupidity   Everything is subjective. Even "science".   fueled by some sort of religious idea   Were I not a libertarian, I'd probably say - based on my religious ideas - that abortion should be accepted. 'tis my libertarian ideology which tells me abortion is wrong.   If not, then it's fueled by a simple misunderstanding of when life begins.   Not a misunderstanding, a disagreement.   I always took you for someone of a higher intelligence.   An attempt to appeal to my sense of superiority will not work with me. Think I'm stupider than a dodo for all I care.

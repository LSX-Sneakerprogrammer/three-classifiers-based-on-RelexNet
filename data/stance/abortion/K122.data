I like what the Bible says. Some things in the Bible makes me sad but it is the truth so i fallow it. You are not understanding. You probably did not even read the link. You're the one who says the Bible is a lie so you need other evidence. That is what i just did and you criticize me for not going to the Bible for information.     We are having a biblical argument. Extra-biblical information is therefore unnecessary, unless you're adding more biblical sources. When you debate science, or non-biblical topics, THEN you provide proof, logic, evidence, etc. When you're debating a specific mythology, you have to hold to that mythology as the final authority.  I've read that site before, they usually change the topic or frame the question away from what was asked and then answer that. They are also superfluous, because the subject was abortion, then "god doesn't disapprove of killing children or babies" with the corresponding scripture. It says right there in black and white, in the KJV scripture I provided that god has no issues with killing children or unborn offspring. What they have to say on the matter isn't important, because they have authority that is below the bible.

It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working?   Mentally retarded people are self aware. Paralysed people are self aware. A person in coma on life support with no change of recovery is not self aware. We should be able to terminate them. They are at this point shells.   If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?   The key note is "all" or "most" or even "vital" cells. We lose cells every day, without suffering harm.   It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.    Abortion != prostitution. If you have an important point to make, then make it.  How many abortions a person obtains is irrelevant to whether it should be legal. It is not pertinent and it is a personal affair.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases.   Not important to the topic. We don't ban vaccinations because of the rare but dangerous side effects. We don't ban surgery despite the very likely possibility of malpractice.  Whatever point you are trying to make is a cover for the fact that late term abortions lead to severe complications when performed by pregnant women at home. An operating room is much safer.   Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion.   I am out-maneuvering you. You only think one step at a time, but I'm several steps ahead of you. Learn to concede when you are off topic and we'll get along fine.   Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us.   How young are you? A teenager? You sure are wide-eyed if you think law and the justice system are about truth.  Juries are made up of peers, average blokes. Many are easily distracted by irrelevancies, just like you were when you brought up prostitution and abortion death rates.   And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.   What makes a strong argument? To most people it is an argument that is easiest to comprehend, and it should appeal to their prejudices.  You want to win points with me? Argue in a way that is clear, has few red herrings, and is rational rather than an appeal to feelings.

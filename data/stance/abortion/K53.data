Sorry, doesn't work that way. You thinking something SHOULD be murder doesn't make it accurate to say it IS murder just because you want it to. Although I should have anticipated you would have difficulty with this concept since you seem to be of the general opinion that all of your beliefs re-shape reality around you and that anything you believe in is true because you think it is.  Or, in other words, you live in a world of self-constructed delusions.

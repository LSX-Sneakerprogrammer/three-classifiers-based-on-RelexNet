Let's say your kid comes to you and says "Daddy, can I kill it" I would bet money that how you answer that question depends entirely on what "it" is. If it is a fly on your shoulder that's been bugging you, then by all means kill it. If it's the kid down the street, then whoa, we need to talk.   The point is this; this is not some esoteric philosophical question. This is common stuff we do all the time without thinking, it's instinctive. We know how to answer this question and we do it all the time.

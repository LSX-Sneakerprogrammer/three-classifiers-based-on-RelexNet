And your taxes wont  link   Not even mentioning that abortion isn't murder,  I see a pattern of you often being misinformed.  Currently most insurance companies cover reproductive services, chances are the insurance you have now either through your parents or employer provides reproductive services that includes abortion. But it isn't taken from your taxes, you or your parents or your employer is  now  paying for abortions.  The new laws are the same thing it looks like. Women can choose to get reproductive services, the money is pooled as is the case with all insurance, and that may be one of the services covered. However, it is only covered if one pays into the system - they are paying for it.  It's the status quo, and the abortion subject was only brought up to rile up the misinformed. What Republicans and some Democrats  tried  to slip into the new legislation was basically a ban on all abortion. They tried to use the bill as an excuse to make it harder for poor people to get abortions. That's all it was.  The fact remains though, that even if that were to happen, if they were able to make it harder for poor people to get abortions, it just means women getting the procedure in other ways that are often dangerous. Never in history has making abortion illegal, or even more expensive, stopped abortion.  You should be happy though. Now you get to stay on your parent's plan for a few more years if you are in a situation where you do not have an employer who provides insurance.  And if your child goes to college someday, they will be able to stay on your policy while in school all the way till age 27 I believe... maybe 26.  On top of that, it will be less expensive as soon as the millions of self-employed who aren't sick but still can't afford a private plan will be paying into the system.  Unless you're single with no kids and make over 100k a year, or have kids and two incomes and make over 200k a year, you are getting a great deal with this bill.

"Abortion truly is one of the great travesties of modern times. Millions of murders have been committed by misguided women who have been convinced that ending the life of their innocent child is alright."   Murder is an act which is committed upon persons. A fetus is not a person. Have you ever accidentally cut off a sliver of your skin? You've just killed more cells in that act than the typical abortion.    How can you live with yourself murdering so many cells throughout your lifetime?    "Life is an ever-progressing journey. It has a beginning and an end. We as humans are constantly changing. I, at the age of 20, am not the same person I was 2 years ago. When I am 40 I will not be the same person. We are constantly growing from the moment of conception until the moment we breathe our last breath."   However, you are self aware of this journey. A fetus isn't even aware that it is alive. It is a mass of cells with minimal brain tissue if any exists at all.   "To cut life off at any moment in this contingency that we call "life" is murder. We know that human life technically begins at conception. That's all that needs to be said."   For black and white thinkers such as yourself, that's all that you can understand. You lack a deep understanding of what life exactly is.  Life for us legally begins at birth. Practically speaking it begins when we are first self-aware, which is well beyond the mere fetus stage.  Taking your argument to extremes, every skin cell is a potential life, ready for propagation through activation of totipotentcy and cloning, or enucleation of a host zygote, insertion of your purified DNA and implantation into a host uterus. Every time you shed dander you are a mass murderer, congratulations.   "What I cannot stand are those who hide behind woman's rights. This is ridiculous. A little while ago, I created my very own you-tube video on this very issue. It furthers my argument"   It's a womans' rights issue because to be a part of a free society means having ownership and jurisprudence over your own body. By letting political groups take over this very important right of a woman over her own body, you are overstepping your boundaries and effectively hijacking her reproductive organs for your own moral agenda.  Maybe you would have empathy for women on this topic if political activists were campaigning to take control of your ejaculations, arguing that a single sperm is a life, and unless each and every sperm is conserved for female impregnation, you were committing murder.

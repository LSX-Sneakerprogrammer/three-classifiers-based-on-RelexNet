And you really believe the fetus suffers? What real proof do you have? Did your mother abort you and you suffered? You are making assumptions.   Granted there is a life in there and it is a cell and then more cells but to state it "suffers" is ludicrus.   Well if it is a case of convenience then for all those teens, unwed mothers, crack heads, and abused women then I do believe they should have the child and give it to you to care for. Most of the time the women who are having abortions know they are not able to raise a child correctly, so you theory says we should not let them "kill" it but, force them to raise a child they know they can't raise properly then blame them for the child going down the wrong path maybe even killing your child, or family member?   You have to remember there is a variety of ways to look at a situation. There is almost no single easy answer for why things are done.

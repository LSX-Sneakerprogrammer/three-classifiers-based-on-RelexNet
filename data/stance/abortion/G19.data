So are you saying that murder is not cruelty? According to the laws it is and also a person can commit rape in a cruel manner by hurting the victim mentally and physically through the ordeal.  Like i asked aveske, a person who is paralyzed has lost their consciousness, so should we kill them because they cannot think or feel too?

Are you familiar with the phrase "making an argument"?  For example... if you say "It is murder if you end a life" and I point out an example of ending a life which is CLEARLY NOT MURDER, thus demonstrating that the criteria you listed for classifying something as murder was incorrect... that is what some people refer to as "debunking a claim".  When you catch up, let me know and we can talk.

Abortion may be murder, it may not be. I personally don't care. I think abortion is an option that should always be kept open. I wouldn't want the burden of raising a child I can't raise, and I wouldn't want anyone to force me or anyone else to.  And before someone tells me adoption is another option, I personally wouldn't like always wondering who is raising my child, and if they're raising them okay. Or how I would want them to.

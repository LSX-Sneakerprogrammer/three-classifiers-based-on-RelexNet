So then you are one of the pro-aborts who believe the woman has the right to kill all the way through the 40 weeks, right? Wow.   But the created human being is not apart of the womans body that is what you just don't get. She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either. The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame...unless a rape occurred.   Abortion is the most performed medical procedure on earth. It is not like other procedures as abortion kills. The abortionists task, goal is to make sure the human being who is alive, is dead when he/she gets through with it. Now if you don't value life then you condone it. If you do, then you don't. Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube. Other than the egg and the sperm...she did not use any organs of her mothers body.,,just a safe place to grow and mature. Pregnancy and giving birth is the most natural thing on earth. It has been going on since the beginning of time. Most pregnancies are uncomplicated and most women would do fine never even seeing a doctor during pregnancy.   A child who is alive would get all the things you say they wouldnt. No hospital on earth would deny lifesaving measures taken to save a child. Even in the cases where parents want to deny....for religious reasons, the courts usually overturn their wishes. Also in the case of death...if parents kill their child out of the womb....its murder. If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not. So the born child gets protection, the womb child does not.

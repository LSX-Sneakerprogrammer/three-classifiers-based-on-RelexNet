"if you are responsible enough to be having sexual intercourse you should assume responsibility for a child." First off, I don't think anyone ever thought that because you had sex, you were also responsible. But, either way, the option for abortion should be legal, I think that making abortion 100% illegal would be a terrible decision. There will always be fringe cases in which abortion makes more sense than having a child, and to strike that option off the list forever would just create unsafe, unmanaged, abortion clinics because they would have to go underground and operate in secrecy without proper health standards. All in all, this country would be much worse off without it.

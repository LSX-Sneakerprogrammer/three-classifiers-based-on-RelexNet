I do agree with you on most points, I believe we do share a similar opinions.  However I don’t know if you were raised in the Amish Province in Pennsylvania or Vatican City but this society we will on now, IS sex crazed even if you aren’t. A society raised by bikini models and skimpy clothing isn't a factor of a non-sex crazed society. It’s getting more and more as sexual repression becomes less and less.   Think about it this way, guys think about sex every 3 seconds, that a fact! Girls go out wearing barely anything for sexual is now days.   "A teen mother is dependent on her own mother. She is in no economic situation to even raise her. She is burdening her network of support, but given proper support can indeed get an education and a wonderful life. "  This is true for most middle to upper class societies. However I talk mostly on behalf on people on the more downtrodden communities because I used to come from one. Teen mums, who are left with a baby to take care of and rely on their mums for support, don’t always have a reliable income themselves. We can’t assume every household is economically stable enough fit to take another child into their family.    "Many of my friends came from backgrounds which should of lead them into being crack-fiends according to you; they are not.”  Yes I grew up in one of these neighborhoods and it looks like your friends were lucky. However we have to look at the community as a whole not a small sample. The social problems with teens start can start with the fatherless household, or the mum always working or the poor living standards. Worst of all these affects are only exacerbated by the poor kind of environment the child will grow up in. There will be crime, alcohol abuse and many others. It may not have affected your friends but you have to realize this is where teen disfunctionality starts and fuels the next generation of crime, prostitution, drug pushers and gang members. I always tend to look at the worst case scenarios rather than the best.  I am happy for you friend for breaking that cycle, however again we cant rely on people to eventually just straighten their lives out, you must realize how lucky your friends are. Not everyone will have the same support they did.  If we want to help the community we have to give them all the education they deserve. If they slip-up then abortion should be their next choice after adoption.

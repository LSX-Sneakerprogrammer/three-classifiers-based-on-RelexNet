I think every woman has a choice--but that choice comes before the unprotected sex...not after. ;)  My opinion on babies that are a product of rape: we have to remember that the baby itself is not "evil." It was the act that was bad, not that baby. Yes...it is unnecessary pain for the woman, but that baby didn't do anything wrong. If it pains the mother to keep the baby, then adoption is always an option.  My opinion is that the only acceptable case of abortion is when the mother's life is at risk.

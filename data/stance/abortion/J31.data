You obviously feel killing is ok, I do not.  You don't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion.  Curious …..what situations is abortion wrong?  I have explained why abortion is wrong. It is not right for anyone to be able to kill something like abortion does…on a completely separate human being. I give it personhood….it is immoral. Taking a life like this is wrong. In war…two sides are fighting. Our servicemen and women sign up to go…they take risks. What risk does an unborn take? How can you possibly compare the two? You can't. War is about protection….how can the unborn fight for its protection?   Well obviously you don't think life is sacred…your pro-abortion. LOL  So if someone killed your little girl or boy….you would not consider their lives sacred, special,….that their lives deserved sanctity?   It would be just Oh well……Ill have another kid.  The mother has rights…she had a right to have sex. She had a right to take the risk. But once a life has started….those rights should be put on the back burner until the child is born…then she also has rights to decide what to do with it. Keep it or adopt it out. Its nine short months…to do what is right…to allow something to live…THAT YOU HELPED CREATE. AFter conception it is a separate human being…this is a scientific fact. A FACT. You propose to kill human beings…you say this is ok.   How barbaric and cold is that?  It should not matter whether the child will make it or not. If it doesn't and dies…then it was meant to be. Abortion is premeditated killing. Nothing spontaneous about it….you hire someone to kill someone…in this case the unborn child in the womb….who was invited in BY THE MOTHER, BUT HER RISK HER CHOICE.  I gee the Oprah example to show that…the argument by pro-aborts does not hold water. Most pro-aborts say abortion is good because……the child might have problems…might grow up in poverty……might face lives trials….  I GOT NEWS FOR YA……WE ALL FACE TRIALS. Oprah did in her life…and she overcame them. She grew up in a home that was not healthy or functional. To kill because you think someone MIGHT FACE A SIMILAR LIFE…is still wrong. So don't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life….so full of misery that they would be better off dead.   You said this…."Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy   and self-consciousness."   Now wait one minute here. Can a newborn baby do any of these? No.  What does a newborn have that it didn't have five minutes before in the womb before it was born? LOL  Are you telling me that you want abortion legal….because the woman has a right to her own body…and THEN YOU TELL HER SHE CANT ABORT IN LATER MONTHS? LOL

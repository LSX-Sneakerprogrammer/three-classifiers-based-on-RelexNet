Why should a woman have to carry the child of her attacker? I'm not saying I agree with abortion, what I'm saying is that people have the right to make that decision on their own. I don't think you or anybody else has the right to tell a woman what she can do with her own body. She has to live with the guilt of what she has done. If she want's to carry that burden then so be it.

Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want.  1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not. But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women; there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.

That is the problem with people like you isnt it?  You don't see the bigger picture.   Of course I do. I just don't consider it particularly important to the argument. How many abortions do women naturally enjoy every year due to the body's natural abortion process? Women must be natural serial killers by your reckoning.   A human life is a human life period, regardless of developmental stage or cognitive ability.   Touchy-feely absolutes like this have no place in a rational discussion. I could very well argue that human life is merely a clockwork mechanism regardless of developmental stage or cognitive ability.   You remind me of Hitler in fact...he destroyed human beings he did not consider human too....perhaps you will meet him in Hell.....you could be lovers ;)   Do you think you are important enough to me that I'd let your comments provoke any kind of emotional feeling? Cold, unfeeling, ice. That is me. Save the insults for someone that cares.

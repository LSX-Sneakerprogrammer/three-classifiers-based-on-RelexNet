#1 Our mutual anonymity precludes the possibility of personal injury by defamation. No personâ€™s identity has been defamed and hence you have no case!   #2 I find it quite humorous that you must associate yourself with some legal professional as though that would somehow imply your competence concerning legal concepts.    Please, by all means, go on making an ass of yourself. It's funny and it totally discredits your position so in effect I win twice . . .   You may think that you have won something, but at what cost?   Lastly, if I make (as you claim) an ass of myself it certainly was not for myself; for I am a man of substance and not image, and the substance I represent justifies every mother-to-be who has chosen to keep her baby. You, on the other hand, are nothing but image, and hence your image is the result of winning or losing a debate about terminating the lives of unborn fetuses. Great Image no doubt!

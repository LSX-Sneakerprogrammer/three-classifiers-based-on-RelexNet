FYI an embryo is a stage of life it's not the thing. Your argument therefore falters because of equivocation. And furthermore person hood is a characteristic of the thing, not the thing.   And finally, I don't discriminate against humans; it's just plain wrong. All humans, especially ones in the early stages of development, are worthy of or full protection. That's called moral clarity.

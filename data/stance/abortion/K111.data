You need a better interpreter then me but i will give it my best. Jesus here is speaking that the Old Testament was speaking of his coming. (verses 17-18)  In verse 19 he is talking about the 10 Commandment. When Jesus was crucified it ended some of the laws in the Old Testament not including the 10 Commandments.  Here is a link to that:  http://www.gotquestions.org/ Christian-law.html

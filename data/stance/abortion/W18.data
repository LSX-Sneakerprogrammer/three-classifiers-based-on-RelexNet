Engaging in unsafe sex is irresponsible. Therefore a woman who engages in it should be forced to go through pregnancy in order to get a lesson in responsibility.  Hmm, interesting argument.   There were 123,000 children awaiting adoption as of 2008.  (source)  So really, you're advocating putting unwanted children into foster care, where they will be supported by the American taxpayer.  If abortion were illegal, than the number of children in foster homes would balloon. How much additional funding would we need to divert from other programs to support that many kids? What would the living conditions be like for the children under those circumstances?  And I still think you're advocating pregnancy as punishment. Calling it "a lesson in responsibility" is just sugar-coating it to make sound better. And I don't think the punishment fits the crime. Nine months of pregnancy can cause a major disruption in a woman's life. I agree that unsafe sex is irresponsible, but people can be taught responsibility in other ways. We should handle this problem the same way we handle other acts of irresponsibility. Give the offender a fine, for example. Force them to attend safe sex classes. Maybe even have a prison sentence for repeat offenders.  Early term abortion can solve the problem of unwanted children without violating any ethical principles. We should not discard a useful tool.

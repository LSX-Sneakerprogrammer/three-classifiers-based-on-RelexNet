I too have my isses with abortion. I am against the idea of man playing a role in human life (this includes the death penalty), HOWEVER...until there is SCIENTIFIC proof of when life begins, I will support its legality. Religion should NEVER have a role in politics, and there should be no Divine assumptions. I certainly don't wanna see women getting back alley abortions because somebody who believes in "god" says its murder. I will also say though that I think abortion is used to quickly and I think there should be a greater stress on alternatives as well as a greater stress on education for pregnancy prevention (and im not talking abstinence). Abortion IS unhealthy for a woman's body, so i would never recommend it. Though, right now, with the info we have, we cannot even consider making it illegal.

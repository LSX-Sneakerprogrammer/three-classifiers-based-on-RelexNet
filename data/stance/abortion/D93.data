Do you have a informed conscious mind? Where you once a fetus? I am going to assume that both of those answers is yes, thus it matters little whether a fetus is conscious, merely that if allowed to grow and develop it will have a conscious mind, but if an abortion is carried out that life will never be given a chance to develop. Just imagine what this world would be like if Jonas Salk, or Sir Isaac Newton, or Albert Einstein, or Abraham Lincoln, or George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson had been aborted as children. It's hard to imagine what the world would be like.

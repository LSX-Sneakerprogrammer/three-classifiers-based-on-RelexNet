... I just looked up miscarriage. Apparently this god character, all powerful and all knowing as he is, simply allows between 900,000 and 1 Million babies to die in the womb of 100% natural causes every single year. Jesus, God performs more abortions than every doctor on earth combined like exponentially.  That's it, I'm starting a god hates god church and protesting every miscarriage in the country. Fucking god and his free-sex laissez faire attidude toward pregnancy.

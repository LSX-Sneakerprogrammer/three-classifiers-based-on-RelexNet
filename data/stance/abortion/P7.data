It may not have any great capacity for intelligent thoughts or feelings, but neither do newborns.   Bullshit. Try pricking a newborn with a needle and see if it has feelings, won't you?   But in the case of abortion, this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body, but the body of another human being still attached to her.   No, you're wrong here. The fetus is considered a parasite. According to the OED, the scientific definition of a parasite is "An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and  draws its nutriment directly from it . Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc." (Emphasis my own)  All a woman does to continue with the pregnancy is to allow the fetus to live within her and draw nutrients from her. Conversely, when a woman chooses to abort the fetus, she is simply  dis allowing the fetus to continue living within her.   No one should have the right to kill innocent people.   The fetus, within the first trimester, is not a person.

1. Rape is a violent crime, a violent act. The rapist should be caught and serve punishment. The woman is the victim for sure. And the child she might be carrying also is a victim. ESPECIALLY IF SHE THINKS TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT AND DECIDES TO KILL IT.   You have made no argument to oppose abortion here. You have simply asserted without evidence that abortion is "wrong". Whether or not the rapist is caught has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not.   What right do you have to presume you know how someone will life and what quality of life the person might have?   It seems to me that the scenario he/she gave was very specific and we do know that the baby would have a bad quality of life at birth, making the chances of survival and access to opportunities very slim. Thus, you have no reason to play the sceptic card here.   Oprah came from a household that was poor, she was also a victims of abuse. Look at her now. One of the most successful and rich women in the country, in the world.   This is a red herring.   There is no family…that does not suffer bad things.   Really? This is a hasty generalisation on your part. You have again asserted without evidence.   How dare you imply that all mentally challenged people be aborted   Mentally challenged people cannot be aborted because they have already been born.   My brother in law is mentally handicapped and he brings joy into our lives.   Another appeal to emotion.   Let me ask you this. Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?   Another red herring.

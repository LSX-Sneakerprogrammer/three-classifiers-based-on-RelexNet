It's not so much killing as denying a chance at life. The argument isn't "is it ok to kill a newborn". Abortion involves fetuses and all the "if it has nails it can feel pain" hold little sway over the reality of the current world we find ouselves in. Grown people are digging into their own arms between heroin injections.   The argument "we live in a flower child world of fairytale births that all babies should have an equal chance" only makes sense when you extract it from reality and explore the idea hypothetically.   - The number of pro-life females would dwindle drastically if they were all raped and impregnated.   - Pro-life arguments ALL rely on the unspoken belief that reincarnation doesnt exist and that the spirit doesn't exist as a world-bound entity, for if the issue was brought up, their arguments would consist of little more than "a fetus mid-developement shouldn't have to feel pain".  - Therefore, since the argument consists of little more than pain, consider logically the ramifications of an unwanted child's development, consider poverty stricken children and the realities they endure, but it's all ok right? They didn't have to feel pain before they were born.   Put into the context of our reality, we can't sustain the people we already have, most parents are RETARDED, and children are raising children. That is the reality that pro-lifers are gunning for. There are thousands of children ready to be adopted, there are homeless children that are seduced with food to satisfy pedophile populations, but that's all ok because unborn children shouldn't feel an ounce of pain.  I disagree with many things that pro-choicers spout are arguments since they consist of little more than dilapidated memes stemming from the same faulty logic pro-lifers employ. Yes it's your body but you made a decision to have unprotected sex and since men are required to inseminate, they have a say too. The only logical way a female has the right to deny the male a say is if she upfront told him he has no say in the matters concerning the potential child. But they never say that, why?, because they would die alone. The way I see this debate, one side is blinly screaming "somebody please think of the children" and the other side is blindly screaming "it's my party and I'll cry if I want to".   Before you devote your lives to ridding the world of fetal pain, deal with the torture that is being carried out uncontested (even though it's often pulbicized=general knowledge), deal with the female genital mutilation, deal with the starving children, deal with the raped children, deal with the unwanted, beaten, emotionally damaged, forgotten, slave children that are a result of poor parental planning you backwards thinking, self-proclaimed advanced specie intellectuals who have nothing better to do than trivialize the pain that exists in this world.

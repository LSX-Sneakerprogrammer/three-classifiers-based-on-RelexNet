"Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human "spirit" or "soul" inside of it (for those who are religious).  So if you were to "dispose" of this body that IS alive and has a human "soul" within it isn't it the same as murder?"   Is this a quantifiable statement. Are we capable of saying that 2 minutes after conception, that bundle of 8 or so cells is not just a human being, but has an intangible "soul". And those toe nails i just clipped that are made up of millions of cells, or if a hair gets plucked along with the root that still has a lot more than 8 cells, those have souls too? At what point is the now separate entity no longer "you"?  If one wears protections, is that not killing potential for having something with a "soul"? Or is the woman's period also murder because it also is killing the potential for a new human being?   "So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.  And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person. Then, put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out.  Is this murder?  Some people will say "Oh well, that isn't the same. That person is fully developed and eduacated"  There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother."   I really don't understand how it's possible to say that a human being, having been alive, having consciousness, can be compared (even in a drugged stupor) to a collection of relatively inanimate bunches of cells. I agree that at a certain point, when the fetus has begun to kick and to show brain activity, that it is now murder to have an abortion. But up until that point, I believe the mother has a right to terminate the pregnancy.  Additionally, you are forming your opinion based on an assumption that all accidental pregnancies happen through laziness. But what if the child has some terrible genetic disease that will render their life to be agonizing. I remember someone referenced a disease on CD where the baby lives for about an hour after birth in terrible pain. Wouldn't it then be mercy then to prevent this from happening before the bunch of cells has become conscious? Or if the woman was a victim of rape or incest, and she got pregnant. I doubt that she would love this child if she carried it to term, and so the child would probably be emotionally malnourished the rest of its life. Would you want to sentence someone to that kind of life?  Another way of looking at is, okay the courts and legislature have agreed to your point of view. Abortions are now illegal. However, that does not mean that people wanting abortions aren't going to happen, and it also doesn't mean that people will stop getting abortions. Women who don't want to or can't carry a child to term will be forced to go to back alley doctors to perform the abortion (or perhaps worse, try to do it themselves) and those unqualified doctors' abortions could lead to their own death in addition to the fetus'. Also, those back alley doctors will no longer have restrictions placed upon them. They will be able to terminate a pregnancy well after consciousness has begun and the fetus is now a baby. Even when abortion is legal, this kind of stuff happens too much, and imagine how much worse it would be if abortion by qualified doctors was illegal.

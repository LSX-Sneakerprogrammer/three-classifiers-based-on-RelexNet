THERE IS A MIDDLE HERE!!   you can be pro-life but also believe people have the right to choose. For Christians who are all pro-life you need to remember that according to your faith God knew what that girl was going to do when he put that baby in her belly. He put it there anyway. If we take that girls right away to choose for herself girls will be choosing life because they were forced to not because they chose that it was the right thing to do. You are eliminating an opportunity for her to find God by making that decision on her own.

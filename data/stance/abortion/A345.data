The fetus  really  is the mother's property naturally (she created it and didn't have to buy it from anyone) , whereas the slave is bought or forced to be his/her owner's property. The 2 situations simply cannot be compared.  .   That's called discrimination on the basis of level of dependency.   No it's not. There's no  level .   The fetus is either  completely  dependent on its mother, or is  completely not  dependent. After a certain period of development, an incubator and some formula could totally replace its mother.  As for me and the local grocery store, I won't die if the local store refuses to serve me.  .   ...did you forget what we are talking about here? We are talking about a human being.   No, I agree that it's a potential human life. Not an actual life. The 2 things are not the same.

people (the mother) should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions. fetuses do not gain moral agency until the onset of the third trimester (the point when basic brain activity and consciousness is possible). The reason why this point is the moment of moral agency is because moral agency can only be justifiably attributed to value attributing agents. Because, prior to this, the fetus is not an agent, morality doesnt apply, the fetus has no sovereignty since sovereignty is determined by the awareness of self.   The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body.

I see every reason why a pro-lifer is a pro-lifer. However, I do believe it should be the woman's choice since the fetus is not born yet. It is much safer than giving birth, especially when done earlier. It helps slow down overpopulation. If abortion was illegal, illegal abortions would be extremely dangerous. It can prevent poverty when it's by an adolescent or single woman.

yeah so people have the right to decide. certain things happen in life and some people may not be able to support a baby. if a girl gets raped and becomes pregnant does she really want to carry that man's child? i wouldn't. plus some women have serious conditions so if they do carry a child to term they could die in labor. this is not good and they should have an abortion to save their life. it's simply not our choice to decide what people want to do with their bodies and if they feel it is not killing someone then it is not on our plates it is on theirs.

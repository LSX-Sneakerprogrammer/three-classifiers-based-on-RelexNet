About rights...A woman also has the right to decide what happens to her body. Just imagine that a little girl was violenced by maniac and what must she do? Give a birth for this unwanted baby? I don't think so. It is wrong to bring unwanted children into the world, because in the future this child will live and doesn't know what mother's love is.

This is nothing but hacky, sickening propoganda manufactured to instill guilt and fear in anyone considering abortion.  A one, two, three, etc. month old fetus isn't thinking  anything , much less babbling to itself about how much it loves its mommy. The most conservative estimates put fetus's the ability to feel pain at 20 weeks, a date after which abortions are incredibly rare, and likely to be for reasons of an inviable fetus or the mother's health. (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_abortion_by_gestational_age_2004_histogram.svg  )  Even this assertion, notably used in pro-life legislation (  http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18785-briefing-new-law-claims-a-fetus-can-feel-pain.html  ) trying to whittle down the likelihood of a woman getting abortion by any means possible (scrupulous or not) is debated by evidence from various studies that place the ability to feel pain at 24-26 weeks.   http://theweek.com/article/index/204531/                                        can-fetuses-feel-pain    The ability to form any semblance of consciousness probably comes well after pain response, making this piece of chain mail nothing but a slanted fabrication that unrealistically anthropomorphizes the fetus. This particular type of argument abortion is particularly repugnant to me because it relies on lies and misrepresentation to prey on people who are at a vulnerable time in their lives and turn them away from a solution they may otherwise have considered.

If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion?   It is true that laws enacted to protect privacy rights also provide opportunity for secret wrongdoing.  Jstantall, you agree that abortions are  sometimes  medically necessary correct me if I am wrong.  You think that a doctor/pregnant woman relationship should not be private but court monitored to make sure doctors don't commit murder. Again correct me if I am wrong.

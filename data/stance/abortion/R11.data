It would be really unfair if the mother was raped and she has to bear the emotional pain of having the child. If the mother was careless and say she was in high school, she would have to drop out of high school to take care of her child. In this cases I think abortion should be legal. Its true that the mother should have been more careful but should she ruin her whole life with one mistake? Through all this what about the child's feelings? If the mother was raped would she be able to take care of the child properly without having a emotional grudge against the child. I heard that the pain from rape never truly leaves you, you move on but you never truly get over it. The child would also have to grow up without a father. If the mother gave birth to the child in high school, she would have to drop out. The child will not be able to receive the full attention the child deserves from his mother if shes trying to take care of the child and study/work at the same time. It would be even worse if the father did not take responsibility like in some cases of teenage pregnancy. In other cases where women of any age are pregnant but are not prepared to take care of the child they give the child for adoption. The child would grow up in an orphanage without ever knowing his real parents. If the child is adopted, how would the child feel? The child might live with hate for his biological parents for as long as he lives and if he is not, does the child deserve to grow up in an orphanage without parents? So this is why I support abortion.

"So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least."  yes. pollen is plant sperm, that travels to other plants.   http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ 10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00414.x/full    "We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms"  Fruits are nothing more than swollen embryonic sacs: they are not only one but many fetuses. If fetuses are alive, apples are alive.   http://appleparermuseum.com/Images/ AppleLongSection560.jpeg    "Fruit were evolved to be eaten.  I shall cite a reference for you..."  only if we were to defecate into soil, where the seeds take root. However, in most societies, fecal matter finds it way into a barren sewage system, not soil. Therefore, you are aborting said seeds, not allowing them to grow into trees.   http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ 10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00414.x/full    if apples are not the same as the trees they may become, then a fetus is not the same as the person it may become.

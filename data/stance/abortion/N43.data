1. This is not always the case. There are some forms of retardation in which they never achieve these. I personally know of one little girl who has massive brain damage and will never be able to fit your description. People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society. Now the incredible irony of all of this is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance. If on your view these people are persons because they have the potential of doing these things, how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?  2. "Reproduction" in the sense of simple life just means the ability to replicate oneself in some manner. It's not sexual reproduction, no, but that's not what the definition refers to. Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive.  Clarification: I am against abortion in all but life-or-death cases. At that point I think the doctor needs to make the call and save either the mother or the baby. The moral landscape is such at that point that it's permissible to take action one way or the other because the doctor is sworn to do everything he can to keep his patient alive.

I'm going to take for granted the notion that federal sanctioning of the taking of human life, be it in favor of whatever "greater good," should not be tolerated. If anyone would like to contest this, let me know and I'll elaborate.  While even the most ferocious of pro-borts openly admit that human life is scientifically defined as beginning at conception, others still insist that it is not, and some of their arguments should be taken into consideration.   But while we're pontificating on the nature of human life, it is extremely irresponsible to allow potentially millions of human beings to die in the name of another's convenience. Better to err on the side of life.

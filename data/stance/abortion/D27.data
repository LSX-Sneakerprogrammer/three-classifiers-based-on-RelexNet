Lack of intention doesn't imply it was against their will. It just means they aren't the brightest fish in the tank.  Will is want, and if you are stupid enough to have sex when you don't intend for a baby to be born you are acting against your own will.  Sex is a means of procreation. If you don't want to create, then why risk it?

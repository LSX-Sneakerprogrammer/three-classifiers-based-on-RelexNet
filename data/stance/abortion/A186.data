My penis has all the DNA in it to make a life. It is a very complex organ. It can feel pain and often has a mind of its own. It reacts to sounds and temperatures as well as the sight of something it likes. It will be heartbreaking for me to lose it, so it's a difficult choice for me. But if I want to get rid of it, it should be my choice and not anybody else's choice!

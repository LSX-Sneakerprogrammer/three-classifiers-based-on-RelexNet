Ok, if you really want to "hit the problem on the head" or "nail the stem" then what you want to do is deal with unprotected sex! That's where the source of the problem is, a pregnancy is the result of THAT! You don't see that?  You go on and on and on about education, which I'm not opposing at all. I'm all for education. What you've failed to do is come up with any feasible educational solution at all, then you even reject my best suggestion to deal with the problem at hand, and you reject it with your BS logic that makes no sense.   Your only answer to this thing is making abortion illegal, that's a great solution pal! Way to deal with everything! Let's just make everything illegal, even if only a portion of the community FEELS it should be!... You people make me sick!

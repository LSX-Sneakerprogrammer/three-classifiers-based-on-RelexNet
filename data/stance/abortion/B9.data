I beleive abortion should be illegal...so your question is not relavent.   I stated that the father does not get the choice to decide...not that I support his right to want an abortion.   I AM AGAINST ABORTION...NO MATTER WHO WANTS IT.  Men dont have a say because of Roe.......this has to do with privacy and the woman owning the right to her body. The make is a non issue.

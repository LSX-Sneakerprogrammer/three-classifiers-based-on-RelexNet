IMO people have a right to receive treatment from whomever they choose, without restrictive legislature, or an invasion of privacy.  Since opinions like mine are a distinct minority, and I don't expect radical change any time soon, I am stuck arguing for the improvement of the quality or justness of laws that address issues beyond what I consider to be the proper domain of public legislature in the first place.  Take as an example marriage. I don't like paying taxes for judges to hear cases about marriage, child support etc..  I did NOT say that abortion is a gross irreverence for life. I said "The sheer magnitude of unnecessary abortions performed these days reflects the gross irreverence for life that is so pervasive."  I believe that there ARE cases where the decision to perform an abortion is made with the best interests of the mother in mind, and with fair consideration of her situation, and what can be accomplished with the doctors current skills. I believe abortion should be something a woman is..to paraphrase Zombee..."faced with", not something she seeks out.  On the other hand....  I really don't think it's the business of government to disturb the privacy of doctor/patient relationships, or to make restrictive laws concerning an individual's choices for medical treatment. Such laws ARE in place however, so I'll talk about how I'd like them to change, since it appears they won't just go away.  I am pro-life in that I think abortion is an ugly thing that shouldn't be encouraged when it's clearly avoidable. I don't have to agree with the approach of outlawing abortion to identify as pro-life. Wanna know something sure to baffle you? I'm also Pro-Choice..  I don't fit your stereotype :)

Why don't you grow up? Do you think abortion is going to make people more responsible. I am not just out here throwing stuff because i want to. I am here because i believe it is wrong. Why don't you read up on Roe Vs. Wade. Do you want to know how abortion came into effect? Jane Roe presented to the Supreme Court that she was raped and the Supreme Court agree with her to have an abortion. It so turned out that she was never raped but she had consensual sex. Now she is against abortion. That is the story that created the legalization of abortion.  This is debating not about silly preferences. For you it is but not me. If it was would it be a national controversy? I don't even see a proper reason for your rebuttal except that it is childish. Would you say that to a District Attorney that he is childish because of what he believes in too?

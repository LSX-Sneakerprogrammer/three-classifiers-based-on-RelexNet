Your subjective belief..not a fact.  Facts are something that are divorced from your general understanding it seems.  A spider may well have a spider soul.   They don't, but that won't stop you from praying that they do.   I guess you are one of these people who THINKS they understand science and nature...if you knew anything about the universe you would know to retain an open mind and not make subjective assumptions based on your lack of experience and knowledge.   You're absolutely right. How foolish of me to not give equal validity to demonology and curses as causes of disease.

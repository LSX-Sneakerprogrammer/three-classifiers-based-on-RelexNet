It shouldn't. It's the parents choice, if you can't take care of a child you shouldn't have on in the first place. Although there's plenty of other choices to do with your kid like give up for adoption sell for weed what ever, it's nobodies choice to choose for the parents. You have your own choices, abortion can be one of them. Especially in poverty or if you're simply a druggy.   Plus, we don't need another GANGSTER or drug dealer in the world. Just saying !!!

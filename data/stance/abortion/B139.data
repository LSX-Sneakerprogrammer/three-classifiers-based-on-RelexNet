And how would the fetus be poisoned? You mean the mother did drugs or something?  And the pregnancy you said could go wrong? How...as I said, less than 1% of all abortions happen because of danger to mother or baby.  You say abortion should be stopped? How? And what reasons is ok to kill?  Why are abortions important? To the unborn killed? Or to the woman who is killing for social reasons?  The solution for woman today....is abortion which most use as one method of birth control. Most women do not have just one abortion...but two and three. So they are killing multiple times. The humanity I am fighting for are the 99% of unborns killed for social reasons.

Your feelings of guilt and sympathy towards a fetus as if they're actual babies is illogical because they're simply not babies.   That is not an argument, it is an assertion you have yet to argue the truth or falsity thereof. Moreover, you have not demonstrated how or why emotions are capable of being logical or illogical. So, I am still awaiting a list of illogical emotions.   (Have you heard the expression, “a fool’s errand”? If not, you certainly will once you realize the terms ‘logical’ and ‘illogical’ are not predicable of emotions.)  One more thought, you may want to take the time and research and learn what an ‘ad hominem’ is and is not.   (I need not mention that your statement demonstrates the fallacy of petitio principii. You should research that as well.)

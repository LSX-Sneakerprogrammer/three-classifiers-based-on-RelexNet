It seems we may of been arguing definitions  Free thinking and free will are synonyms to me; as is perspective and mindset. mindset can be seen as a perspective with a positive feedback loop.  The mind is a beautiful thing full of feedback loops and self modifying. It is bounded by its original state and its environment. If all one starts with in life is instinctual behavior then there is a chain of reaction in all their "decisions" which amount to them being based on instinctual behavior. I can write some javascript code which is selfmodifying in such a way which changes how it modifys itself based off of previous modifcations. The exact way to do this would take some time though. currently i'm working on a automatic logical analysis of statements to access their validity; which means i'm looking at their structure and seeing if there are any possible ways the premises could all be true and the conclusion false. I won't have much time to work on either one till summer though which is a roughly a month away. a self-modifying function which changes how it modifies based on previous modifications sounds like a challenge but i know its possible for programs have been evolved and not made before in other languages and thats essentially what i would be doing. i might work some on it but it won't be a high priority project. matter of fact i just found this site yesterday and i need to spend less time on it. I'm in love with argumentation, call it my addiction. i went on a tangent back to the different points.  My spiritual existence is only valid under determinism. This may require more explaining but might be best made a separate debate.  consciousness is an emergent property of a electro-chemical machine, it is the same as the polarity of water.   freewill and freethought both suggest that a human being can be a first cause that their decisions are neither random nor determined. A human being is not a god. Although god is an ambiguous word and in one sense i can say that, and in another sense i can say i am my own god. Perhaps god is a word which should be avoided in debate due to its ambiguity.  Abortion constitutes many other debates, it is a debate which rests upon many other debates. I have unique viewpoints upon those debates and i find most other people to be inconsistent when it comes towards abortion, on either side. I'm making a debate to see what the smaller issues are that might be debated best separately.

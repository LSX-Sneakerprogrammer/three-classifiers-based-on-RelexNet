Even if it doesn't have a brain, my belief is that the PERSON still has a soul. The soul is what gives the PERSON LIFE The bible says once you are conceived the chosen PERSON has a given soul that the Lord has chose for you. Please do not argue with my spiritual beliefs, i have chose to believe in God and the law protects that.   I'm going to give you a pearl of wisdom. When you are debating, you automatically forego the right to back your position with religious beliefs, or spiritual beliefs; in other words you agree to reason your position with logic, rationality and evidence. Emotional pleas can be used but they should never serve as the core of your position, because emotional pleas are subjective and go the way the wind blows. Even in a theological debate, one must back their position with orthodox texts.  I am a strictly rational individual, and what you said to me by invoking god is that you have a belief but cannot support it with evidence or reason. If I were cruel I would mock that as being a weak position to take, but I think you should be shown why your position is not a good one to take in a debate.

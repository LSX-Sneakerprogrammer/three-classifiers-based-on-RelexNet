how could abortion be acceptable think about the nature of it itself not yet born and a child is kill rather crucial when you think about it.but i must ask those who say yes to this argument lets put it this ways you are in the comfort of your moms womb and then you were killed you hadn't not born never seen or taste or touch and for every day of your life you wonder to your self why did my mom abort me and to think again maybe i would have been a great politician or even the future Martin Luther King but then again you would never know cause you were never born

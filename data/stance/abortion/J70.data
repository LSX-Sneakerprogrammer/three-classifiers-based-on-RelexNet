I am also antichoice drugs…and rape….and child pornography. You can also add..anti selling body parts,selling organs also abortion for the purpose of selling fetal body parts. All these are laws that prohibit people from doing things that most would not hurt anyone else. But we still have them on the books.  are you pro-on all of these?   How is this relevant to the debate at hand?   I am antichoice abortion.   Wait. You're against women and/or parents having a choice, but you are pro-abortion now? Or that you want abortion without giving people a choice?   It is simply using the space to grow.   Not only that. The unborn fetus also uses it's mother's body for nutrition.   It did not ask to be there it was invited by its mother.   And thus, the mother has the right to  un invite it.   I do not fail to see anything…I see things crystal clear.   If you say this, that means you're deluded.   Anyone that opposes protection for the unborn is pro-abortion.   Again, short answer is "yes", long answer is "no".   That is not pro-life   You aren't pro-life as well if you will not allow a mother, whose life is threatened by the pregnancy, to abort the baby.   "I am pro-choice but I am against abortion"…you would be laughed out of the room. It simply can not be.   You're myopic and deluded.   Can you be pro-choice and sit back and allow your neighbor to abuse his children? Could you have been pro-choice and allowed slaves like they did in the South? Could you have been pro-choice and turn your head at what Hitler did to those he marched into the ovens?   No. I am pro-choice but I do not condone abuse, slavery or genocide.   I am not happy.   I don't give a damn.   I am not happy with positions here because they are barbaric and cruel and cold.   So what? That says nothing about whether or not they  ought  to be done.   Debate is a way of changing hearts as well if someone is open enough to examine their position.   I would say the same to you, but I realised now that you're myopic, closed minded and intolerant of the beliefs of others.

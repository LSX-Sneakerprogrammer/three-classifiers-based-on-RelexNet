The only time an abortion is allowed is when the continuation of the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk! Otherwise, under whatever circumstances, abortion is a crime..   Let me ask you a question. Are you aware of foetal development? The first four weeks after having unprotected sex, there isn't even an embryo yet. Once you have the embryo it's weeks before it even develops into a foetus, which means it is a few cells with no mind or organs. 50% of abortions happen before the woman even has a foetus inside her. Once it becomes a foetus, it's another 7 to 9 weeks before it even has a heart pumping blood. The brain is still in the process of growing. 40% of abortions happen before this point in foetal development.  You are acting emotionally when you should be detached. This is a rational situation, not an emotional one.   It's a crime against the unborn baby; against the mother - even if she doesn't want the baby(for a further explained reason); against humanity and our morals and most importantly against God.   The unborn baby has no rights at this point. It isn't a person yet. Maybe it bothers you to think of people in a way that allows them at some point to no longer be people. Humanity doesn't suffer from abortions, the only way it could suffer is if abortions were so common that our death rate exceeded our birth rate, but this isn't the case. Morals and god are irrelevant, because those are beliefs and values that belong to you and only you, they aren't exactly shared by the women having abortions so it is a case of you imposing your god and your morals upon someone else against their will.   Even if this pregnancy occurred due to unsafe sex or it was unexpected by a couple, no one has the right to object to what God has created.. If it's because of unsafe sex, when are you going to take responsibility of your own life and live with the consequences of your mistakes?!   The woman is taking responsibility by terminating the pregnancy. In her case it would be irresponsible to have a child that isn't wanted and would grow up lacking the support it needs.   Who, nowadays, is not educated enough to know that somehow unsafe sex can lead to pregnancy?!   Protected sex can lead to pregnancy, depending upon the failure rates of the contraceptives used. Also bear in mind that the religious groups you're supporting by bringing god into this are often against contraception, and spread misinformation about it, such as "condoms contain holes" or "condoms have HIV inside of them." In this respect they are against the methods that prevent pregnancy and are against the tools that stop pregnancy as well, they seem to want women to function as baby-factories, or live a celibate lifestyle.   In the case where you were "raped", then i suggest you get yourself together and talk about what happened to you before it's too late and you'd be more miserable than ever..   And then she has a child who is a reminder of the man who abused her. The child will suffer for this, and that's how you end up with a more dysfunctional society: children neglected by their mothers who wind up on the streets as thieves or gang members.   In the case where the pregnancy is unexpected - or so it's called - why do you think it happened in the first place?! Everything happens for a reason and only God knows why.. so again, who are you to question fate?!   If it's unexpected, it could be that the child will be raised in poverty because the mother can't afford it.   No one has the right to decide the fate of another creature.. NO ONE! but God...   Yet you're here telling pregnant women what their fate should be.

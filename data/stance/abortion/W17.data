It's not so much punishment as it is a lesson in responsibility. What makes a woman responsible enough to have sex, but not responsible to give birth. If she got an STD from the unprotected sex, she'd have to live with that for the rest of her life and depending on the disease, it could kill her. If she gets pregnant, she can give the baby up for adoption or she could be a responsible woman and raise it on her own or with the help of others.

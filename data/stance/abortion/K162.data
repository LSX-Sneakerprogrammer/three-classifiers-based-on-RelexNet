No the question is what do you not understand. You are the one saying that an undeveloped human hasn't the rights of a developed human an yet we were all once "undeveloped" so we technically have no rights since we were undeveloped. So you would not care if your parents decided that oh we want an abortion because it is undeveloped so it does not have the rights that we developed humans do.

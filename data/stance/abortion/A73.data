The "baby" is not yet a baby. It's only a POTENTIAL life and not an ACTUAL life. So you're not killing a baby. If it can't survive outside of the womb yet, then it's not actually anyone else's choice but the mother's. Noone else can keep it alive, then they should butt out and leave it up to the mothers. If she wants to put it up for adoption, great!, If not, it's her choice since she is the one that has to keep it alive inside her.

Yes contraception fails..........but that does not chance the facts. The woman knows it MIGHT fail...and chooses to do it anyway. The responsiblity is HERS.   I believe what science says...  Some people do not make a connection between birth control and abortion. You probably see them as two different acts. The fact is however that some birth control are abortifacients because they work by causing early term abortions. The IUD seems to prevent a fertilized egg a new human being from implanting in the uterine wall. The pill does not always stop ovulation, but sometimes prevents implantation of the growing embryo. And now we have the RU-486 pill that aborts a new fetus, a new baby.   I am not a sexist....you are, your pro-choice position is sexist. You think this is just a womans issue, that the father who has DNA in the newly created human being should not have a say in the matter of whether his child is killed or not. I believe they should have a say. I would bet you dont. So who is sexist? LOL  You want the woman to have her cake and eat it too. You want the father to pay, only if SHE decides to have the child...and in that case you would go after him for child support. What rights does the father of this newly concieved child have? NONE. You give him none......I don't. The fact is....pregnancy takes place in the womans body. The man deposits the sperm.....and that is it. She allows him to do this. If you think he has and should be responsible.......THEN WHY DENY HIM THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHILD? You are the sexist one, not me.   Our government tells the father.......YOU ARE NOT IMPORANT until the child is born, whether you want it or not...then get out your wallet. The woman holds ALL THE CARDS...and your giving her a pity party.   My statement is right about Louise Brown. She was concieved in a petri dish....nothing the mother or father did...helped.   It's a scientific fact that the mother is one distinctive and self-contained person and the child is another. Being inside something is NOT the same as being part of something and ones body does not belong to anotherâ€™s body merely because of proximity. Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried.   In July 2000 the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill making it illegal to execute a pregnant woman. The logical reason for this decision is that a preborn child is an individual person, distinct from his mother and with his own separate right to life. As I said our laws are wishy washy.   Human beings should not be discriminated against because of their place of residence should they? I am sure you would think that premature baby lying in a hospital incubator deserves to live. Would the exact same baby deserve to live any less because she was still in her mother?  But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   Your worldview is sad...........  You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic. I picket them...never seen one dragged in, not in ten years. No woman gets an abortion unless SHE CONSENTS. Place the blame where it belongs. It is her body she has the right to decide. There are places that would help her....I work in one.

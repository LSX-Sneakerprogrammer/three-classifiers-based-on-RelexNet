Well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument?   You're so wrapped up in this duality you've created you haven't even considered that my position is not one of morality. I'm not "for" or "against" abortion.   It's called "pro CHOICE" not "pro abortion". =/   You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right.   No, you've IMPOSED this position on me. This is a matter of your prejudice, not my implication.   Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact?   I don't care because it doesn't matter. I have no right to decide what is good and what is not for other people. Perhaps some people end up more responsible, perhaps some don't.   The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.   To justify and prove, eh? A debate is a means, the purpose is invented by the individual. This is still a debate whether my method is through debunking your conclusion or putting forth my own.   Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone.   You seem to be under the delusion that one can derive a position from facts without forming an opinion. A position without opinion is just facts, a position without facts is just opinion. You need both.  I'm not arguing against the facts, I'm arguing against your stupidity. Don't try to shift the blame onto the facts, they can't help what they are.   Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case.   Because your argument is rooting in morality, mine is rooting in questioning your morality. If you disagree with the origins of abortion for the same reason then it makes no difference, you're still arguing from your personal preferences.   And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself.   Then start a debate "How did Abortion Originate?". It's another topic and doesn't bare any relevance to this one.    Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you?   You wouldn't like my answer =p   Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.   Can you please get through just one sentence with proper grammar? You can pull up "facts" until your fingers are worn to stubs. It means nothing if they aren't relevant.    If you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name?   You... totally missed the point -_-   Is that all you can say "you came up with it?" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion.   Are you dyslexic? That made almost no sense. =/  Again, look up the term "debunking".   But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them?   Again, I've said no such thing. At least  try  to make relevant arguments. =/   I don't want them to be grateful to me, i want that child to be grateful to me. A life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society.   Well well, what a noble man you are; placing the value of life above the value of a good life...  Did I say noble? I meant retarded.   Well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think. If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?   Again, either you are a liar or your league is full of idiots. ;)   Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.   Debating 101: debunking and calling out opponents on non-sequiters IS how a debate works.   There's no need to "prove" someone else's abortion is none of my (or your) business. Debunking your reasons for being "pro-life" does that by itself. Do you understand?   You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.   1+2=3 &lt;&lt; you understand this, right? Well, here's a line of reasoning almost as simple and easy to comprehend.   District attorneys are people. People can be stupid and childish; therefore, district attorneys can be stupid and childish.  There's no need to become a district attorney to understand that they aren't infallible.    Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.   Everything is constantly changing. You're heart pumps fresh blood, your skin falls off and is replaced, sperms turn into zygotes etc. etc. etc.  Life and death aren't opposites, they're complementariness.   Well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from.   Wrong again. I'm not building an argument, I'm debunking yours. There's no "running" here, simply wading through the things you've said.   And lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning. Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do i have to explain everything to you?   Nothing you just wrote changes that your Hitler debate has nothing to do with this debate. you could be lying about the whole thing for all I know.  Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do I have to explain everything to you? ;)

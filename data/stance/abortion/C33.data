You live in Ireland then? Otherwise there is equivalence.   You do not get the point.  Laws are mutable...subject to change...and it varies...region to region...state to state...nation to nation.  Thus you cannot cite law to support an argument that is based on ethical considerations.  So yes if it pleases you let us assume I am Irish..or from a country that makes elective abortion illegal.   Seeds may produce trees. Apples are extremely heterozygous and may not breed true.   So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least.   Apples react to light and photosynthesise.   You cite various sources describing metabolic processes in fruit.  You are being disingenious..  We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms.  Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.  Fruit were evolved to be eaten.  I shall cite a reference for you...  ''In biology (botany), a "fruit" is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower, mainly one or more ovaries. Taken strictly, this definition excludes many structures that are "fruits" in the common sense of the term, such as those produced by non-flowering plants (like juniper berries, which are the seed-containing female cones of conifers[1]), and fleshy fruit-like growths that develop from other plant tissues close to the fruit (accessory fruit, or more rarely false fruit or pseudocarp), such as cashew fruits. Often the botanical fruit is only part of the common fruit, or is merely adjacent to it. On the other hand, the botanical sense includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, tomatoes, and many more. However, there are several variants of the biological definition of fruit that emphasize different aspects of the enormous variety that is found among plant fruits.[2]''  Wiki - Fruit  You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.

There is no point of arguing over abortion in my eyes. Why? Because if a woman wants to kill her own child, then she will.   When there is a will there is way.   Murderers who have the will to kill will kill. Rapists who have the will to rape will rape. This is not all neccesarily true if we interfere, of course.

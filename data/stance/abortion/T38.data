I take it from that statement then that you are also against capital punishment, and for Universal Healthcare.  Christians are such hypocrites, I seriously dislike you people.  1. It has no more feelings or emotions than this keypad I'm typing on until the 3rd trimester, and then about as much feeling and emotion as a grasshopper.  2. If you don't want an abortion,  you  don't have to get one. Why every Jesus Cannibal thinks they have to dictate everyone else's life is a mystery to me.  3. Even if you somehow managed make it illegal, guess what, there would still be just as many abortions.  The only difference is that they will get abortions in dirty basements like they did before it was legal, and more mothers would die.  So "Pro-Life" would actually end up costing more life.  Congratulations, way to kill a bunch of young mothers Edward. Jesus isn't going to give you a cookie now.

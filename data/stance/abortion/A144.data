infer (v)- to derive by reasoning; conclude or judge from premises or evidence  -----  I have stated in my previous arguments that you should not judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion, and you disputed my argument. Therefore, I can infer that you are against what I have said.  ----  I can see now that we have been arguing two different questions. The question is not about whether abortions should be banned or not. I already answered that they should, with there being exceptions for special circumstances. One of those special circumstances I mentioned was rape, and you disputed me on that circumstance. That does not mean that I am against abortions being banned; I would like for that to happen. I think you got mixed up when I said that and inferred wrongly.   -----  Practically all Christians are against abortions, because it goes against what the Bible says. I am against them too, however I do not believe it is right to judge someone in a negative manner if they do have an abortion. The same goes for gays as well concerning harassment. You shouldn't judge someone, period. When you judge someone, it eventually leads to hate, and God will not forgive you if you do not forgive you neighbor for what they have done. People make bad decisions every day. Their (people having abortions) sin should not be ridiculed upon or emphasized as one of the worst sins, because we also commit sin, and God looks at every sin the same way, except for the one I mentioned in my previous statement. You should tell them that what they are doing is sinful and pray for them, but I don't believe you should harass them and look down upon them for what they have done.  -----  I am inferring that you are a Christian, although I may be wrong. Could you specify what religion you follow? I am a nondenominational evangelical.  -----  I get what you are saying with Romans 1:18-25, but what you fail to realize is that although a person has an abortion, that does not mean that they cannot be forgiven of it and become Christians later on. The only sin in which you cannot be forgiven is blasphemy against the HS (Mark 3:29). You should not degrade them for what they have done, but encourage them to turn to God so that He can forgive them of their past wrongdoings.   -----   How very judgmental of you.   You took it out of context. Read the entire paragraph and you will see my response. I also put in in bold in response to your other statement.  -----   Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches.   Wow, and you are calling me judgmental...  -----   note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here.   Jesus condensed them into two commandments for Christians to follow. See Matthew 22:36-40. They revolve around love, not murder.  -----  Hmmm...so let me see here. According to the verses you mentioned, you believe that you must follow the Ten Commandments in order to have eternal life? I want to make sure I understand your point of view, because I disagree with it if it is so.     Romans 10:9,10  "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."  Ephesians 2:8,9:  "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from youselves, it is the gift of God-- not by works , so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do"  I can't go on until I know which religion you follow, but it is clear from these two verses that if you are a Christian, you are saved by faith in God, not by obeying the Ten Commandments. Paul touches on this in his letters. I don't have the time right now to look them all up, but I will list them later on if you would like me to.

You kept saying that abortion is right? Why don't you answer me if abortion makes people more responsible? You speak as if i am here throwing out stuff just like that. I am surprised that you even want to discuss abortion but yet you don't care. To me that is just childishness. How can a person argue about a topic and say they don't want to know about the rest? If i am silly about my preferences then how come you don't know anything about abortion? Who looks more silly? Me or you? You don't tell me my preference is silly when you can't even give a justification for your choice? Maybe you should come when we are debating and you will have to see how debating goes and why we law students choose our topics. Your opinions are based on arrogance or ignorance without any proof or evidence. Why don't you try becoming a District Attorney and if you can become one then judge them.   Try answering my questions and then we can continue this debate because i don't have time to waste on any argument filled with arrogance. If you are so skillful in researching the field of abortion then do me a favor and respond to the following questions;  When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.  Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?  What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?  How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?  Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?  If you say you don't care or you avoid these questions then you are clearly showing that your level of knowledge in this area is based on merely your opinions and not facts. If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified. Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.

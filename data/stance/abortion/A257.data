..."illogical emotions"...   Obviously there are many emotions. Please list the emotions that are illogical.    (BTW, your arguments are mostly ad hominem. And as far as I am concerned they don't evidence a willingness to debate a proposition; they merely attack the debater and fail to argue the evidence of your position and your accusations.)   Yes, I will continue to dismiss your posts. (Unless of course you demonstrate sound argument.)

Abortion is fine if a woman does not want to keep the baby. It's her body. She is the one experiencing the pregnancy.   Some say the life inside the woman is not hers. Life is sacred. Therefore she has no right to abort it.  But the life is inside her body. Besides, life is far from sacred. Everyday, about 25,000 humans die from hunger. Every day. But nobody really cares. A fetus is not even a fully formed human. In the early stages especially, it is just a bunch of cells.  Abortion is something that shouldn't be trivialized. But undoubtedly, for the right reasons, there is no moral issue here at all.

Wow. You actually hit the nail on the spot for the reasons for increased teen sexual behaviour. But let me make it clear (again). I don't blame sexual education. It's one of the reasons.  I think we only disagree on the concept of sex education. Or our experiences of it anyway.  It is good to be taught to practice safe sex. It is good to learn about the dangers/consequences of sex. But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex, they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.  Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The messege was have sex - but make it safe. Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe. The problem is the liberal attitude. Liberal sex education = bad. That's my point.  P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D

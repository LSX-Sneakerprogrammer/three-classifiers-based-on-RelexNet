When you say that term neither you are portraying to me that either you are confused or you are not sure which side to take. How can you be neither when everything you said so far has supported pro abortion? If there were two teams and each of these teams were either pro life or pro abortion, which one would you choose? Obviously, there is no way that you can say neither, so which team will you choose? When people say pro choice they are referring to a woman's right to have an abortion. Do some research on the topic please. You words tells a lot about you and to be very honest with you that is why my response is coming so low graded to you because expect to get what you portray. Well i do not care what you say because like i said am the creator of this debate and you are the person challenging me so to me it means less. You seem to forget that you are debunking without facts so if i am liar good for me. Again i will not have you calling me names and if you do not stop then i will restrain you from posting any arguments in relation to my debates because name calling is childishness to me and the same goes for comparing. Really? I think your problem is you love to judge and if you continue doing that then again i will restrain you from debate and then we will see who is the debater and the respondent. Let us keep it to a professional level please. By doing this you are making both of us look like two children which we are not. My conclusion is drawn from facts which i have demonstrated in my arguments but you point to one part where you made reference to facts? Did you see my entire argument was based on fallacy? Because if you said so then i think you are jumping to an inconsistent conclusion. And again i do not care what you call me because like i said i have already proved myself to a panel of judges. You can say all you want but it wouldn't affect me but lets just keep it as a debate on a professional level.

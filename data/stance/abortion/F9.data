I'm a moderate on this issue. I believe abortion is 100% okay up until a certain point in the pregnancy, but during and after that point in the pregnancy, it's 100% wrong. Both radical sides of this argument are stupid; sorry. There won't be a solution to the abortion issue until people take a stance that isn't stupid and/or insane. Compromise on subjects that are not inherently black and white is the only want to go withing being unproductive.

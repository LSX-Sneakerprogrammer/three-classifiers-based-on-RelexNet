I am pro-life.  I am a faithful Christian.  I have five younger siblings. The two youngest I remember their life clearly.   I want you to look at a one day old baby, look at her fingers, toes, face, legs, watch her breathe, and watch her interact with people and tell she was not a human being in the womb.  I want you to watch a 2 year old play with her baby sister and tell me that the baby was not a human being in the womb.  I want you to look at a one day old baby, look at her fingers, toes, face, legs, watch her breathe, and watch her interact with people and tell she was not a human being in the womb.  If you can do either of these, I will be astounded about how emotionless you are. And I will pray that some day abortion is illegal.

Why make it illegal for women to choose what goes in in her own body? It's not illegal for women to choose sexual partners or what vitamins they take in the morning or what they eat for lunch, why try to limit their opportunity to choose whether or not THEY want a child?  Law Enforcement is great, but it doesn't have a standing on this issue. Illegal abortions aren't obvious or even really noticeable crimes, yet they cost so many lives that could be saved by simply legalizing abortions.   If you don't believe in Abortion... don't get one. that's your free choice... Why is this even being discussed in society, really?   Whatever happened to freedom of property, expression and religion?

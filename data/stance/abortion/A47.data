Its me again!  "...If it's not self-aware it's not a human yet, no matter what it looks like"  Then why are we so worried about the trees? Are they are "self aware"?  Actually, human children are not self aware for some time AFTER birth. Does that mean we can dump them if we change our minds?  "...Abortion is illegal after the third trimester except in extreme circumstances"  Not exactly true. There are states, and forgive me for not remembering right off the top of my head which ones, that allow abortion "up to the moment of birth"  I will see if I can find that one.  "...no matter how many of you right wing nuts high jack this site and serial down vote us sane and logical participants on the site."  Now thats disappointing. I really thought after reading some of you responses that you were more open and intelligent than this. Isn't it cool to be tolerant anymore?

Really? So why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage?   A person with Alzheimers has started to lose their awareness, their brain is literally being destroyed. We grant them this exception out of mercy.  However refer to what I said before: laws are not based on reality, but what people feel ought to be. I don't care about what law says.   Again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells, tissues, blood cells and or organs, does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them? Does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life? Why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then?   When you kill cell, you kill life, but not A LIFE. Same with early-stage abortion.   You seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics. Again, abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman's body over which she has total control. So to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body. Why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic. The last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman's right to control her own body.   I answered you before on this topic: laws are not required to be consistent with each other. That one is allowed and the other forbade is not representative of our stance that a woman ought to have control over her body, but is representative of our legal system's inconsistency.   If the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money? Don't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going? Again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality.   I did not say this. I said that how much it is performed has no bearing on whether it should be illegal. This is about granting a woman the ability to terminate her pregnancy, a very personal choice that affects her body. It isn't about punishing women who have abortions commonly.   Check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds. So then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion. Read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also don't forget that abortion can cause future infertility.   Since you're being obtuse, I'll explain this to you explicitly:  Deaths caused by surgical abortion in a hospital (where trained physicians and emergency equipment reside): some number.  Deaths caused by surgical abortion at home (since abortion is illegal and the woman has to operate on herself): higher than the previous number.   Why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic? Isn't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not? Last time i asked that question, the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible. Almost half of all abortion cases (48%) according to the Center For Disease Control are repeat abortions.   Again, explicit language:  Abortion exists to end unwanted pregnancies. Your concern over repeat abortions is based on personal feelings of morality and a desire to punish irresponsible women, it is irrelevant to the aim of abortion: ending unwanted pregnancies.  Should we ban condoms because some people have dozens of partners and are avoiding the consequences of disease? No. Condoms exist to prevent pregnancy.   It does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments. My opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims.   Sorry to disappoint you, but your arguments are all over the place. You have no direction and I have to keep you on topic.  You're free believe that you'll somehow "beat me," but if this is your best caliber of argument style, you'd better just ask me to help you learn how to improve your debate tactics.   Debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself don't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic?   Of course I understand your questions. I can tell you're off topic because whenever you ask a question that appeals to an authority or my emotions rather than the issue at hand, a woman's right to end her pregnancy and the scientific fact that most aborted foetuses cannot be self aware, I know you're obscuring the topic.   I might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon, i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the Supervising Police Superintendent of Juvenile Affars, Legal Clerk for The Attorney General in my country and also Assistant Sworn Clerk of The Supreme Court of my country. Now i am pursuing my studies in Criminal Law.   You're still but a child, and could learn a few things from seasoned adults who know much more about these topics than you.   Again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem. Maybe on this website but not in reality. And because i am a teenager does not mean that i don't understand what society is because there are many adults that would never be able to accomplish what i have done.   And you don't think that critical thinking on my behalf has prevented me from engaging your red herring topics, hmm?  Winning an argument is real life has little to do with the truth. That's why politicians engage in petty topics and the news is full of mud slinging. That's why in the United States, half the population believes the earth is under 10000 years old.  You might have had a busy few years of your life, but don't forget that you're still young and have a lot more to learn. Now please, proceed in the debate but focus of the issue of foetal awareness, and compare it to the woman's level of awareness. Also look into the dangers of illegal abortions, and discuss the societal effects of forced pregnancy on unprepared mothers.

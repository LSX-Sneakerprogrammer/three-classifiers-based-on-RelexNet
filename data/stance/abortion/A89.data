People shouldn't be having sex? Doesn't that mean they'll be preventing babies from being born = preventing conception in the first place? What if that baby wanted to be conceived but its parents decided to use a condom and prevented it from being? How far back to the future do you want to take this "life" argument?   Here's where I draw the line: Before the fetus can digest milk via its digestive tract, it is entirely the mother's decision whether it should be aborted or not. It is PHYSICALLY a part of her and is not yet capable of survival without direct connection to her (via the umbilical cord) and so it is her decision and should not be made illegal.

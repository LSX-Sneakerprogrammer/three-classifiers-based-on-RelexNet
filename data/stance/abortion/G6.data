I'm very against abortion, but I'm not stupid; I know there are times where it is a necessity. I think it should ultimately stay legal, but should be a lot more restricted. I don't see anything good from a 25-year-old going in and getting an abortion because she just doesn't want the baby.     Why should it matter to you if a person does that? That's awfully nosey and judgmental.

It's not "life unworthy of life", it's actually "POTENTIAL life!"  Until the fetus can actually survive outside of the womb, it's a living organ like any other organ inside the woman's body. Once it reaches the stage of about 20 weeks when it should stand a slight chance of survival and maturing into a person, then it should be made illegal. But before that time, it only has the POTENTIAL, nothing more. A potential is just that.

I've lost everybody in this thread... can we just say that:  - stabbing a dog anywhere is kinda sick and is not ok (unless you eat dogs like in some countries).   - abortion should not be outlawed until week 20 into the pregnancy.  - people who are pro-life should keep their point of view and not force it on others and make them feel like they're murders, cos it's not like killing a person.

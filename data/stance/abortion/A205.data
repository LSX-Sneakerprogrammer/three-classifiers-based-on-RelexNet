I guess you were not man enough to match the video  Silent Scream  because that video clearly show a fetus doing what you say it can't; showing signs of awareness.  I also I didn't say"   few people have experienced abortion first hand ". What I said is that few really know what it is.  About being "closed minded " it doesn't matter what the thing looks like. "  If it looks human and genetically it's human; it probably is human.  The question still remains unanswered: What kind of being is it? Your attempt to redefine the question hasn't changed the question, nor does it answer it. And a question not properly answered doesn't go away. That's why abortion is still a hot topic 35yrs after Roe vs Wade. There are a lot of people for whom something seems dreadfully wrong and for those of you who support abortion to dismiss us with some fancy mental gymnastics is simply inadequate. So please, answer the question.  You also lose credibility with statements like these" the vast vast majority of abortions take place before the first couple weeks. " How do you abort something you don't know you have? In most cases it's a missed period that tips the woman off and that takes time. Facts are annoying things when they contradict you and you can't make them go away by changing them. Do your research first before you make assertions like this, Because for those of us who have. you lose credibility. But I think you make my point that most people don't know much about abortion.   But tell me iamdavidh, were you ever an unborn baby? Because if you were. you have to acknowledge that an abortion would have killed you, not something else but you. And that means abortion kills people in the early stages of their life not something else that later becomes them, but them.

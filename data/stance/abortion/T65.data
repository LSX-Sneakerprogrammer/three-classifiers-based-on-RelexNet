If it is not considered life when the egg is fertilized and is starting to grow, the when does it become a life. Where is the line between a incomplete mass of cells and a life.   The best line I can determine is when an offspring becomes self-aware, it is considered a life worth protecting. Since it may be that even an infant isn't fully self-aware, we could set the line to when the fetus has a sufficiently developed brain. These are all measurable to some extent. These are also both good arguments for when a fetus should be protected because they can be defended rationally.   If a woman miscarries is she wrong to fell like she lost her child.   No. It is a reasonable reaction upon losing a potential life.   Oh, and since when does self-awareness determine life, a man in a coma is still human.   A man in an early coma may regain consciousness. A man who is in a permanent coma is just an empty shell, the only rational argument that could be made for keeping that shell alive is if the brain damage could be repaired feasibly in the future. Otherwise, it is only sentimentality that is making people keep the shell alive.   Edit:   By the way, I'm matter-of-fact about these things because I have no emotional attachment to the subject. I am not trying to treat this subject flippantly, if it seems that way.

I would like to offer some clarification on the question "can I kill it" and the follow-up question "what is it"  As I have stated before; the taking of human life requires a high level of justification. No argument that I've seen for abortion rises to the level of proper justification. Please note what I'm discussing; the taking of human life, not any life but human life in particular.   So what does that have to do with the question "can I kill it" That question needs to be clarified; hence the follow up question. What I want you to notice is what kind of question "what is it" is. It is an ontological question. We're asking about the very nature of the thing in question. And that's important because it determines how we answer the first question. But notice this is a strictly ontological question; it is not a question about level of dependence or development. Why is that important? Because if the thing in question, ontologically speaking, is human then it requires a high level of justification to kill it. If it's not human, no justification is necessary. I'm not saying if it's human you can't kill it, sometimes you can and must but you must properly justify your actions. This is were abortion fails because the only reason it gives for the most part is because the mother just choose to. And yes I'm sure she went through some tough decisions but bottom line; she wants to. Because the fact is she doesn't have to; she has other options.   But what happens when you kill without proper justification? You have to find a way to justify the act because your conscience is smitting you. This is always done by making the victim less than human or not human at all. Because after all if it's not human, no justification is necessary. And this is were I have seen all the arguments for abortion go. They leave the ontological question and move to other areas that are more easily justifiable. Most of them are framed like this:  can I kill it? What is it? it's just a..... Well of course you can  They all answer yes by qualifying the object by something that is easier to justify; a standard that is lower not higher. But let's answer the question head on and notice how the gravity of the question changes when we answer the follow-up question correctly. And by correctly I mean answering the question according to the kind of question it is, an ontological question.  can I kill it? What is it? It's a human, one at the very early stages of it's development......   So let's take the question of this debate head on; Should abortion be banned?   What is abortion?   The taking of a human life at the very early stages of it's development.   Why would you want to do that?   Because I don't want the inconvenience of a child.  Does that sound like proper justification for the taking of human life, especially the weakest and most vulnerable human life?  I have reduced, intentionally, all reasons for an abortion to a matter of convenience because ultimately that's what it comes down to. If a pregnancy, regardless of how it came about, stands between you and what you want it's an inconvenience; and we all know what we do with inconveniences. But this one is a little sticker because it's human. But if we can take away or cloud it's humanity then it will be easier to do.   So should abortion be banned? Of course it should, for obvious reasons.

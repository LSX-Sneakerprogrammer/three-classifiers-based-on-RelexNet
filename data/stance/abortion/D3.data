It is more likely that if something is illegal, because it is unregulated, standards may slip. Yes, it is possible that a blackmarket clinic may be actually safer than some legal clinics, but because of the very nature of the black market, in being deregualted, there is no guarantee. Comparitively, because legal practioners would be regulated, there is an expected minimum, a guarantee of sorts, at least, if you will.

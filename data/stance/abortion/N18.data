1. So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people? What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.  2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.  3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.  4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.  5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.

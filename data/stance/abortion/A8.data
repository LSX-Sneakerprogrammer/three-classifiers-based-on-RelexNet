That's called discrimination based on level of dependency   No, it's called discrimination based on level of development. Before it reaches a certain stage in development, it'd still only be a potential and it shouldn't have any rights whatsoever.  .   Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious   I'm not ignoring anything. I'm trying to clarify things for, apparently, a stubborn fool. A human potential life before a certain stage in its development shouldn't be afforded any rights whatsoever.  .   What you call "potential" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not.   You're still dishing out BS and completely ignoring my points. Look up "potential" separately, then marry the 2 definitions together and then you should read this: I agree that it's life, I'm only making a distinction that it's potential. This is the case because even though it may have all the internal systems of a human life, they're in no condition to function until a certain stage is reached in its development. That's why it's a potential life. If you're incapable of putting the meanings of 2 separate words together, we should stop any further discussions.  .   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day?   Don't quotemine my arguments for your benefit. I said we make laws to help us with our lives. Tell me  how  banning abortion helps with our lives. Don't deviate. You think the planet is overpopulated now? You think the Earth's resources are being stretched now? Just mandate the saving of every single pregnancies and you'll see how our lives will be affected then...  .   Call it what you will but a duck by any other name is still a duck.   Yes a duck is a duck, unless it's only a potential duck! ;)

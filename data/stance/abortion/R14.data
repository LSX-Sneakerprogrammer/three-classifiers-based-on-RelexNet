The problem people have with abortion is the image they have of a baby dieing in the mother's womb. Unless you can remember what it was like in and coming out of your mother during birth then you can not argue that baby's know that they are dying. Babies in the womb are not thinking and do not have brain function other than to keep their organs functioning. People all need to realize that if a baby is not going to make it, the mother is not going to make it, or both aren't going to make it through birth. By disallowing the option of abortion to that mother, not only do you deny the mother who will die the right to Live but also you deny that baby a mother.

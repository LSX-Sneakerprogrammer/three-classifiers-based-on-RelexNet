Saying something is proper justification doesn't make it so. You first have to prove that it is and that you haven't done. You've only dismissed it's humanity. . If it is only a sperm or egg it is indeed alive but not fully human seeing it lacks the full chromosome set. But once it fertilizes and the chromosome set is complete; it's fully human. Either it's fully human and alive or it's not. I don't see any other option and the potential life argument doesn't factor in at all.  Again we are talking about the proper justification of taking human life; rabbit trails don't interest me.  About hassling; I will defend the innocent at my own expense; even if it cost my life because that's the right thing to do and it's always right to do what is right.

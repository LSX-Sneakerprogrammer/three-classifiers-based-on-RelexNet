Ha ha ha, I'm not at all. You don't get it. I'm talking about her point of view in the UK. People don't talk about it because medical history is personal and the British are a different personality then us over medical information all together. You apparently aren't friends with many British people like I am. In the United States, you are correct to a small extent, but don't think it's the same way in the UK just because you want it to be. It's not.  Wow, you're a hypocrite AND a sexist. Ha ha, now things just got interesting. You're a hypocrite because what you said wasn't pro-life and it was contradictory to itself. You said 'circumstance doesn't matter unless the women is dying on the table'. That's hypocrisy. Hypocrite.   Also, why does my opinion not matter in the case of abortion? Because I don't feel what an abortion is like? That's a very sexist thing to say. You're right when it comes to dead beat fathers, but they wouldn't give an opinion in the first place. I have the right to my opinion and half of the decision over the abortion my wife may or may not receive for the same reason that my wife ALSO has the right to her opinion and half of the deicsion over the  kidney donation  I may or may not do! You have a problem if you think neither have those rights in that situation. In fact, you're sexist if you think I don't deserve an opinion in that situation. Sexist.   My opinion is nothing like that. How is it like that? You're saying things that have absolutely no substance... back them up. Never once have I said that I know what it's like to have an abortion or how much it feel or hurts or damages. So, what merit is this 'you have no right' argument, other then to be sexist, hm?  I called you one name in the previous comment. I called you it because you deserve to be called it. You said something that was hypocritical. So I pointed out that you are a hypocrite, because you are indeed a hypocrite. That doesn't compare to you calling me a butcher, murderer, pro-murder, illogical, humanist, pro-abortion... all of which are untrue. Making you a SUPER-hypocrite, therefore. You think I'm loosing? Really? You haven't replied to half of my big arguments because you have no counters, and so far, you have only replied with meaningless jargin that proves no point. Like now, you say my worldview is pathetic because I called you one name. How so? I called you a name that is true. It's not like I called you a cunt, which I didn't; in fact, I haven't used a single profane word to describe you.   Now, explain to me in a sensible manner why my worldview, not humanism, you namecaller, is pathetic and devoid of real happiness, without the use of senseless jargon. I believe, in relation to abortion, of a balance between two illogical and extreme beliefs. Whatever you think, I am no humanist just because you say I am, namecaller. I called you a hypocrite because you said something hypocritical. Humanism is a belief system that you assume I follow in it's entirety, which I do not. Namecaller.   You don't believe in euthanasia or the death penalty? Well, that just shows how the comment 'No circumstance matters unless she's dying' is still hypocritical. Hypocrite.   I AM NOT ARGUING IN THIS COLUMN THAT IT HAPPENS OFTEN, I AM ARGUING THAT YOU ARE NOT TRULY PRO-LIFE AND THAT THE PRO-LIFE STANCE ON ABORTION IS DISCOMPASSIONATE. Showing once again that you fail to see the real point behind my argument. Stop living in your magical world and start  reading my comments . Holy crap.  Well, you're right about that, but that doesn't make your beliefs any less illogical in relation to the grand scheme of good and evil. That's what happens when you take a radical opinion. You don't think about everyone, you just think about a specific direction of people.  I don't care only about myself. How do I only care about myself, you hypocrite? That is such a malicious thing for you to say, and it is totally untrue. You know, you're only digging your hole of hypocrisy deeper and deeper. You said I was being malicious and calling you names, and yet you're saying all these untrue things about me with no evidence. I'm calling you names I only have supporting evidence for. Hypocrite. Namecaller.  Troll . Meanie.

Abortion is wrong because it takes a life.   Is the taking of a life  necessarily  wrong?   Do you think two wrongs make a right?   No. But I don't think that abortion is  necessarily  wrong. It is wrong in some situations, but it cannot be considered to be completely wrong.   Abortion is wrong whether the woman was raped or not.   But you haven't explained why abortion is wrong. Saying that it is wrong because "it takes a life" doesn't say anything because you are making the assumption, without any justification, that taking a life is wrong.   If you think all life is sacred then how could I think less of the baby whose mother was raped?   I don't think that all life is sacred. I don't believe in the sanctity of life. That is merely an illusion. What you are  really  doing here is ignoring the rights of the mother in favour of the unborn child, whom we don't know will even survive birth or the first few years of its life.   Red Herring?   Yes, it is a red herring. In your previous comment, you haven't asserted how your Oprah Winfrey example supports your argument that abortion is immoral.   Should she have been aborted simply because she had shady relatives…or that they were poor?   Not necessarily. I haven't made a judgement on Oprah at all so don't you dare put words in my mouth.   Are you telling me that there are families that have not endured sadness, death, dying, troubles?   How does that support your view?   Do you think that mentally challenged, physically challenged people should have been aborted? If it is known that they are not normal…and what is normal anyway…..should they be aborted? yes or no   Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness.   Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?   That has no relevance to whether the baby should have been aborted or not. Again, you can't abort an born child. That is an illogical statement. It's like asking the question, "Should Person A, who is a bachelor, have gotten married?" The question is wrong by definition. Thus, I don't have to answer questions that are logically incoherent in the first place.

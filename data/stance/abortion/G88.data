actually prostitution isn't illegal at the federal level (with some small exceptions  ref ) and there aren't any federal or state laws left that ban suicide  ref  and many libertarians and liberals would want some of the same principles to apply to drugs and euthanasia (in case that is what you really meant by suicide).  PS suicide can only be illegal if you don't succeed. ;)

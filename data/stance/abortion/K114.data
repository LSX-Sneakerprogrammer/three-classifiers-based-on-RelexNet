You do not understand the Word of God because you are taking everything literally. If you would actually study the Bible and have someone interpret it for you because obviously you do not understand the true meaning. Yet you still criticize me for going to a different source for evidence other then the Bible even though you want me to use different sources. Explain.     If you're debating science, you use scientific evidence. If you're debating a particular mythology, you use that mythology's canon as a reference. Is this so strange to you?  Why shouldn't I read the text literally? Because it doesn't give you answer you like? Christians are very strange this way, whenever you read the bible in a way that doesn't put your hindsight into it, or gives an answer that doesn't seem favourable, they say something like "you're reading it literally" but when you discuss science, or medicine, or politics, the same Christians will go right ahead ans say "science is wrong!!! because it literally says the earth was made in six days."  Try being consistent. If you want everything to be metaphorical, then stop saying that the earth is six thousand years old, that science is wrong, etc. If you want everything to be literal, then accept that the old testament still applies.

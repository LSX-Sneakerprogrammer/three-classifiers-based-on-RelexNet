Abortion is a really tricky subject to navigate, because on one side you are saying, " Killing an unborn child is wrong!" or "Women have the right to decide what happens with there own body!". The problem is that people can agree with both statements at the same time. If you want an abortion because you don't think you are ready to support a child because of your youth you have a valid point. Daughters of teen moms are 22% more likely to become teen moms than their peers. Sons of teen moms are 13% more likely to go to prison than their peers. Not to mention the impact on the teen moms themselves. Less than 35% of teen moms finish high school, and only 1.5% of teen moms get there degree by age 30. I am pro-choice because i don't think it is just to force someone into those statistics.

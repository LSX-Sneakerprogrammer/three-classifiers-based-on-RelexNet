"A baby is a baby the moment the sperm meets the egg. Even though the heartbeat does not start until later, it's still a baby in my eyes."   You should be more careful of beliefs like this, because they are a double-edged sword.  To clarify, when you believe in something as absurd as that, you are also arguing that a baby (as in, the life which has exited the womb) is equal to a single ball of cytoplasm in value and respectability.  In other words, you define the concept of "baby" to be so wide that the word no longer engenders feelings of protection to fetuses, or even zygotes, but instead spills over the image of an incomplete, mass of of cells with no self-awareness onto post-birth babies.  All of a sudden a baby is a mass of tissues and a brain with no true self awareness, all because you thought it sentimental to attach its name onto a mass of an obvious pre-life.

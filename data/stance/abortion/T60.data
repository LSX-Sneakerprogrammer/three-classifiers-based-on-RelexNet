It's wrong to kill a child just because you don't want to raise it. You knew the risk when you chose to have sex. As for rape cases, your right to choose was stolen from you, but that does not give you the right to take away someones right to live.   There is always adoption if you don't want to raise your child. And yes it's a child. Just because it's smaller and less developed does not make it any less of a child. Just like a child being smaller and less developed than an adult does not make it any less human.

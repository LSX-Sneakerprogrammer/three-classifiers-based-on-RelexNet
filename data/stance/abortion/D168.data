It is a known FACT that human life begins at fertilization.   Life. Not consciousness. Taking life painlessly is justified in some situations.   Just because you may be adopted does not mean you’ll have a miserable unsuccessful life.   No one said this.   Did you know that Faith Hill, Jamie Foxx, and Babe Ruth were adopted?   Did you know one of the aborted children was going to be a mass murderer? Did you know one of them was a better baseball player than Babe Ruth? This is why your argument is nonsense. If all three of your examples were aborted, no one would feel their absence. Even the fetuses wouldn't.   Abortion is done for mere convenience. Many women don’t know the true facts of abortion until it is to late and often feel depression, guilt, isolation, insomnia or nightmares, and much more after it is done. Even Jane Roe (Norma McCorvey) is pro-life now.    Just as a side note, a lot of this could be said about giving birth. But it's right. This information should be publicized more, and made mandatory before going through with the procedure.

1. I disagree with your definition of life. One must consider both scientific and philosophical perspectives for a comprehensive definition to be made.  2. A fetus does not have all of those features from the moment of conception.  3. I disagree with the assumption that a fetus is a human being. Again, one must consider both science and philosophy.  4. Killing a fetus is not tantamount to murder, in the same way that contraception is not tantamount to murder. The prevention of possible life is not tantamount to murder.

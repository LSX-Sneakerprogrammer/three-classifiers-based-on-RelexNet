All of us were once a fetus.    Agree.   That is a child.   Disagree: unsupported leap in logic. The organism passes through varied stages of development between "fertilized egg" and "child."   Obviously, none of you chose to watch the posted video   Incorrect assertion. Watched it, multiple times, not in favor of outlawing abortion.   We are challenging the law. This is also our constitutional right.   Yup, that's your right, but since SCOTUS has already rejected "it's a person it's a child" not just once but many times, continuing to just assert "it's a person it's a child" while citing to a video from 25 years ago is probably not a very strong argument with which to challenge the law.

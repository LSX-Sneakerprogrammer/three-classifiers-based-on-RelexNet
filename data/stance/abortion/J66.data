You are pro-abortion in every sense of the word. You just don't like to think of yourself in those terms. It implies something not nice.  You oppose legal protection for unborn children. If you wanted protection you would be pro-life.   That is not the case. What gets me are the people like yourself who say abortion is gross and ugly…..yet sit back and do nothing about changing law…..BECAUSE YOU DONT WANT THE LAW CHANGED.  Now that is morally baffling.

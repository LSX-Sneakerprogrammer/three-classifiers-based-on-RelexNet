It is true that an 'is implies ought' argument is not valid with regards to plastic surgery. With the plastic surgery part of my argument, although pointing out the current frivolity of its existence, I was hoping to emphasize the fact that resource use and waste has more to do with the economic demand, not the equitable distribution of resources in spite of the economics. Having a greater population will not reduce this problem, it will only amplify the numbers of people that have insufficient access (A pro-life world increases the overall suffering in the world because scarcity is increased - you could think of this as a utilitarian point to make, though I am not a utilitarian). Population growth is the biggest reason why people go without, scarcity is defined in terms of population, ie if there were 100 people the notion of scarcity would be unreasonable.   -I was not suggesting that prenatal care or the rearing of a child is necessarily a waste of resources - the discussion was about resources and with a greater population there are thus less resources per person to be distributed, thus by adding more to our population such that it is continuing to grow, rather than meeting or being less than the replacement rate, creating greater desperation in any given population - if you know anything about sociology you would understand that most of the desperation of scarcity effects children and young mothers (abortion reduces this). I was trying to say that the amount of resources that are used in raising a child are vastly greater than having an abortion. Abortion solves the problem of using more resources (even though it does use some ~500-700 dollars worth) and the problem of over population (not increasing it as much) - There would be more resources for less population thus the quality of life individually and society generally would increase. The only way using resources on child rearing is a waste is if the people turn out badly and are a drain on society. There are not enough resources. Have you ever read freakanomics? if you have, you would know that there is a statistically significant link between crime rates and the incidences of abortions in this country - i.e ~18 years after abortion was legalized and abortions were more frequent, crime rates took a precipitous decline in the mid to late 80's (not a point necessarily to justify abortions, just a point to demonstrate the link between crime and desperation and the population that are born into scarcity). IF abortions were clearly wrong i would not think they are justified even if they caused a decline in crime.   -When you said that you are looking at the rule that I had described - I was refering to the statistical likelihood that unwanted children tend to have unproductive lives, be criminals, be on welfare, have teen pregnancies, use drugs, etc...  -When i said that the father is important you seemed to think that i was implying legal basis, but I was not, I am not sure why you argued against my statement there, i was thinking in terms of how the relationship ought to be considered.   -You could argue that they confer legal rights to the father but wouldnt have any constitutional justification in doing so. I agree that there are issues with a woman being able to hold a man responsible after birth even if he didnt want it, however rather than forcing her to have a child based on his rights, i think that there should be legal choice to abdicate rights after the birth of an unwanted child.  -"if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents." - I dont know if the moral issue of your scenario has to do with the intrinsic value of the plants. It is generally more to do with the extrinsic value of the plants being wiped out and the effect this has on the species that are worthy of moral consideration and the integrity of the biosphere that sustains complex life. Thus it gets back to the entities of intrinsic moral value - human beings (biologically human and agents which have attained consciousness), and I would also argue other morally aware species like dolphins and pigs and chimps but then you get into trans species ethics which is a different topic.

attn Palinin2040:  the double standard used by many anti-abortionist/pro-lifers makes me kinda blah about the so-called abortion debate [just give 'em education and contraception and watch the number of abortions drop]  they wail-n-moan about innocents murdered in the womb (something the government has nothing to do with in comparison to war) but turn a blind eye every time a bullet or bomb. that they paid for, kills murders an innocent Iraqi or Afghan child  why even bother discussing the thousands of Vietnamese killed in "free fire zones" and during "carpet bombing" raids  a young woman decides to "kill" her baby and the "lifers" don sack clothes and ashes.   your government kills and the "lifers" rally behind the flag and cry patriotism  thank goodness this rank hypocrisy is being well documented and will not be erased from history

I should further say to disprove this argument you have to falsify it's key premise and that is:  abortion takes the life of an innocent human being  That' why this whole debate hinges on one key question: What is it? And genetically it is human. It has it's own unique and complete chromosome which makes it distinct from it's parents and wholly different from the egg and sperm used to create it.   Since this syllogism is sound and it's premises are verifiable you will have to resort to irrationality and unscientific assertions to disprove it.

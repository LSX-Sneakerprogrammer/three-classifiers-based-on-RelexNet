I am aware that your arguments were for someone else. However, I have a couple remarks about your arguments that I would like to share with youâ€¦   Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy.    What about the victims of rape? Should young girls risk their own lives for something they did not even consent to?    What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?    Death penalty gives us the right to decide whether someone dies or lives. At war, soldiers constantly decide whether innocent enemy soldiers and civilians should live or die. So, human beings are given the right to kill others.   I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts...but would it really matter or affect your views on abortion?    You did not state any proof. You only quoted doctors who agree with you.   I have one last question: Do the rights of an embryo outweigh the rights of woman?

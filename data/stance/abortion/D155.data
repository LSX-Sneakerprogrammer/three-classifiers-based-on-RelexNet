I think the crux isn't really whether it's DNA, but rather potential. Because again, we dint know where to draw the line between what's considered human and what isn't in terms of DNA. But alas, i support the right to abortion because i believe it really should be the mother's choice. Consider if I suddenly imposed a set of conditions on your lifestyle out of the blue. Would you want to be rid of me? As natural as to value the sacridity of human life, I believe the right to self determination is equally important. But realistically, it occurs to me again and again that human life isn't valued, while self determination is aggressively fought for, and that is why I think it makes more sense to support self determination rather than human life.

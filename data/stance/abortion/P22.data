I am not particularly supportive of abortion, but I cannot justify criminalizing it. Different definitions of life exist, and I cannot decide which is the most pertinent. Plus there are MANY reasons why a woman may choose to get one, an almost limitless array of scenarios. Uniform criminalization, even if allowances are made for rape or incest, is too rigid for the fluid reality.

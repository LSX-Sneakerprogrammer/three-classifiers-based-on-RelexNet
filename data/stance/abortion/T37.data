Would you want to be killed without a choice? That's disgusting!! Life is a gift, and the people that kill their children are sinners and will go to hell!!   Strictly speaking there is no "you" until you're months old and have developed the cognitive ability of self-awareness. Until that point you're just flesh, basically.  By the way, there is no afterlife. Just putting that out there for you.

Yes. I'm siding with abortion cuz it is never just Yes or NO. A lot of wrong things happen. But, they happen for the right reasons. To you killing a baby is all that is visible. I do not say your wrong. I cannot tell you are right either. What kinda solution do you come with if going further is dangerous and not to is equally dangerous.   I'm not going to say that there is never a choice. There always is a choice. Look... Sometimes, giving birth to a baby is risky. It might mean the mother's life too...    What difference does it make whether she harms it or someone is hired to kill it? It dies in both scenarios?   Yeah.. Give birth to it then, when it can fully understand the meaning of pain and let it die. While you could have saved it all the pain. All that torture. Like... We had a nuclear tragedy in India. The birth effects are just preposterous. Kids died when they reached the age of 1 or 2. The mothers were denied of abortions, not by the hospitals but the family members. Some of the women weren't healthy enough for the birth process and hence they died. Even today Women are forced despite their health conditions.  I do not say it is right. But, it is never just a Yes or a No. There are always issues. There must be exceptions. To certain things. Certain 'unavoidable' things.  I agree with everything that you mention. It isn't wrong. But, I only mean to emphasis on those few things that stand importance too.

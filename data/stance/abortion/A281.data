Yes I do, because I think clarity is more important than agreement and I'm trying to be precise in my thinking. I don't find ambiguity or equivocation very helpful in debates. I ask the question because it is an ontological question and we need to know what it is that we are taking the life of. Asking the question of personhood doesn't get us very far because it is a characteristic of the thing in question just like the word fetus is. They tell us something about the thing but they don't tell us what the thing in question is. To know that requires an ontological question and that's why I ask; what is it? And you are correct, it is human although in the early developmental stage known as fetus just like you are at the stage known as adulthood, assuming your past puberty and if not you are an adolescent and yet still fully human just like a fetus is. And humans are the sort of things that have personhood; it's not what they are but a characteristic they posses.  Now I think the question, what is it, is one you would ask instinctively. What do I mean. Assuming you have a child, what would you say to that child if it came up behind you and asked; can I kill it? I'd bet money that the first question of your lips would be; what is it? And if it was the fly that's been bugging you, you would say yes and if it was the kid down the street you would say no. You see your answer hinges on the question; what is it and no other question. I hope you can see that. And the reason you would say no to killing the kid down down the street is because you know, instinctively, that humans aren't the sort of thing you just kill flippantly, it requires proper justification. That's why I oppose abortion. Killing humans for the sake of convenience is unjustified and evil.   BTW insult is not an argument, it's what you do when your position is unsound. You try and discredit your opponent to make yourself look good. But notice my character is unrelated to the question at hand, it has no bearing on it. That my friend is known as a genetic fallacy and an Ad hominem. You don't actually answer the question, you just obscure it and that's the opposite of clarity.

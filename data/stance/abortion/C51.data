In order to be sacred you need different DNA? I never understood that argument, quite frankly and I have heard it before... as if having unique DNA gives you consciousness and individuality.   In order to be 'sacred' or human you need to have human DNA.  In order to be a unique organism/lifeform (multicellular or unicellular) you need unique DNA or perhaps even RNA in the case of viruses.  Having a unique genome as does the foetus (and its identical twin(s) possibly) means that the foetus(es) is(are) a seperate biological entity(ies) from it's/their mother.  That is the crux of that argument...hope that clarifies.  Yes plants bacteria and other organisms effectively clone themselves in certain hermaphrodite self fertilizing or mitosis related situations...but even the clone will not have 100% of the parent DNA.  The laws of entropy and biolological mutation demand that...or evolution would never have occurred.  Every organism is unique...if only very slightly.

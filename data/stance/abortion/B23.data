Abortion:  When life becomes subjective, and a killing an option.   Since when is it acceptable for people say that because it's not 'quite human' we can just do whatever the heck we want with it?  The logic of something needing to PROVE that it has a right to live is just sick. Why is it that we get to define when it's okay to exterminate something?  Why is it okay to kill an unborn child, period? It might be understandable in some situations, but it doesn't make the choice RIGHT.  I LOVE how a person can go to jail for killing their household pets, but then it's suddenly perfectly okay to kill an unborn child because it hasn't met someone's standards of "It deserves to livee~"  I can support a person's decision on the matter when it is completely necessary, but all the people who think abortion is all right and good is just sick :/

Starting from the top:  Yes, if before consciousness.  Yes, if before consciousness and to save it from agony in life.  Yes, if before consciousness.  Yes, if before consciousness.  Yes, if before consciousness.  Yes, if before consciousness.  Yes, if before consciousness.  No, because that would have to be after consciousness, unless it is fore stem cell research and before consciousness.  Yes, if before consciousness.  Yes, if before consciousness and for the affirmative reasons to ' Something wrong with it? '  ... Yes, if before consciousness. Though, for that shallow reason, even I can agree it's a waste of valuable meat if the abortion is before consciousness.   There doesn't need to be a medical reason for killing an inhuman piece of meat, because it's meat. There are no morals applied to killing it. A conscious human, on the other hand...  Yes, it does give me the shivers to take a human life. But the life of meat? Not really, no. It's like fighting bacteria. It has no soul, why care about bacteria? (Not that this specific part of the response has anything to do with you addressing me.)  He thinks it's not wrong because abortion (to him) and murder and totally different. So yes, you did miss something. Again.

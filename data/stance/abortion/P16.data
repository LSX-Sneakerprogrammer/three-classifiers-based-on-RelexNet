Many of you view abortion of taking a minature breathing baby out of the mom and breaking its neck or something, it is not like that. Many times an abortion occurs the fetus is just a clump of developing cells and, in fact, it is not a living thing at all.   Some say (when this defense is brought up), "It is killing a future baby". Well, actually, whenever a woman has her period she is killing a future baby.    Sorry if this defense crushes all the beliefs you were taught..

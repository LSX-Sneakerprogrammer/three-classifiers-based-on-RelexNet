"It is a taking of a human life however you try to spin it."  So when a the female body naturally rejects a fertalized egg is that a taking of a human life? Only a minority of fertilized eggs make it to conception.  Let me ask you, what other rights do you assign to fertilized eggs? If the death of a fertilized egg bothers you, are you a vegatarian? After all, a cow is a million times more developed than a fertilized egg.  It never fails to amaze me how many people are against abortion on the theory that fertilized eggs deserve to live, but then oppose welfare, education, etc. etc. Guess what, kid? We cared about you when you were a blastocyst, but now that you are actual human being you can go f  * yourself.

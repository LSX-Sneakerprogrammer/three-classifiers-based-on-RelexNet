There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it?   There are more questions than that.. sorry   If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life.   So you admit that there are  some  cases where it is justifiable. The next question then is who gets to decide? Should it be society at large via established government institutions or should it be a private matter left to the sovereignty of the family unit and those health care professionals they consult?

You are correct about the double homicide law; however the contradiction is inherent in the ruling itself. The double homicide law was only raised to illustrate this. In fact I would argue that the law (double homicide) came to be because of the contradiction.   You might be correct about overturning the ruling. It might take another case challenging this ruling and it's constitutionality.

Guess it depends on who's study you read and how they ask the questions. The CDC tells a different story. STD means sexually transmitted and if your not having sex (any kind of sexual contact) you're not transmitting; It's that simple. Ask the CDC what they do in an outbreak, quarantine. Why do hospitals not allow children visitors during flu season? Why are you advised to stay at home when sick? Please tell me why this approach works for all diseases except sexually transmitted ones?

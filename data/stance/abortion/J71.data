You know what puzzles me……?  Here we have a picture that the pro-abort side DOES NOT WANT SHOWN. It factually is true and this is how a later term abortion happens. It happens the same way however in earlier abortions…the baby is just smaller. But never the less body parts still are dissected and torn from the fetus alive…until it is dead. So this is the face of abortion…FACT.   What gets me is this. Most everyone here I presume is pro-choice. Why?  They believe that the woman should have the rights to her body and that its a personal decision that only she can make. She should not be burdened by carrying something she does not want…and she may do this for any reason. Abortion should be legal so that if she decides to kill her baby she can.   So why does this picture…upset pro-aborts/choicers? If they embrace abortion for all the right reasons….then what is so wrong with it?   Is killing a living human being bad? No says the pro-choice side. Why the emotion from this side for being called pro-abortion? Is there something your not telling us? Certainly you don't advocate something you find immoral..right?   If abortion should be legal…because its the woman body her decision. Then how many of you would agree that even late term abortions like this….are ok?  LOL  How many of you would want to enslave her in later terms just because you find late term abortions repulsive and wrong. The baby looks more like a baby….and gee, just tugs on your heartstrings doesn't it…..sigh.

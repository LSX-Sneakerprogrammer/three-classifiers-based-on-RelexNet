I thought about it some more. I think even tho both male and female are responsible for the pregnancy, the female is more responsible. Why? She allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg.   You said  the man allowed his sperm to fertilze her egg. blame the man?   I would blame the man if he aggresively allowed his sperm. Meaning, it was rape.   I don't believe in accidental pregnancies. You might say, what if a condom breaks? That is why on the box it says 99 percent safe.   And i know that the sperm don't ask permission. I don't understand what you mean by that question. ???  I honestly downvoted you and i thought some more afterwards. I gave your vote back (don't really much care if you care for votes) but i wanna when is pregnancy accidental?   Sperm comes out due to orgasm. So the man can predict when the sperm comes out or not. Which mean it is not an accident. If somehow a man get out his sperm without feeling anything...i would consider that an accident. I am going to make a debate about it.

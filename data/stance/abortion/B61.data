If I masterbate into a woman's vagina instead of the shower drain it's "potential life" as well. Yet the bible says "it's better to spill your seed on the belly of a prostitute than to let one drop hit the dirt"  So basically it's okay to pull out, therefore it must be okay to wear a condom, therefore it must be okay to get rid of a cluster of cells (sperm's a cluster of cells just like that virus in the woman's belly before the third trimester).  Really the only lesson your silly book teaches on this is that hiring a prostitute is healthier than jacking off all the time... which I agree with by the way. If only Christians knew the bible as well as atheists I might get along better with you idiots.  Anyway, once again this is a case of religion creating a boogie man to control the masses through fear, and everyone forgets what it was like when abortion really was illegal because crazy ass stories are easier to remember than history apparently.  The only thing making abortion illegal decreases in the entire history of mankind, is the number of women who have safe abortions. It doesn't decrease the number of abortions, just the number of safe abortions.

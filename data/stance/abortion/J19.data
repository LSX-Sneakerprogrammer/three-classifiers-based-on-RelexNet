They want laws in place that give the woman the option of killing.   And there you go. They don't want abortions, they want the option.   So you think abortion is badâ€¦but yet you want it legal so others can do it. LOL   Yes, pretty much. I think religion is bad, but I'd never consider taking it away from people. I think war is bad, but it can still be valid. I think people being a dick is bad, but I think it is their right. There's lots of things I don't like that I would still support. Just as Voltaire said  'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it' , I feel the same way about abortion.   Nothing is good about abortion.   That's not true.  No, I do not. Without being an expert in biology, I'm leaning towards a 'first trimester' option, to me that seems to be the commonly accepted medical grounds. Makes sense, after that the foetus becomes too lifelike, and the emotional trauma is too great. Also, how could you possibly give her the right the whole way through, when she's in labour, that's ridiculously impossible. A time limit makes sense.   We are given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitution   No, you are. I am not American. Please do not assume that everyone you meet on the internet is American, especially when I've written so in my 'about me'.  Yes, but the constitution is a legal document, it can easily be flawed. Just because it's there doesn't make it right, you must verify what you say.  And further, if you did accept it as truth, that only applies to citizens. When a foetus has citizenship, it gains the right to life. To do that, it must be born. So there you go, another circular impossibility, can't gain protection unless it's born, when it doesn't need protection.

I disagree with you at the age of 16 and 18 they do fully understand consequences. Parents and teachers and life teach them that every action has consequences and by that age there have been enough lessons of actions and consequences.   If you think having an abortion fully erases the mind of "error" as you call it then well then you never had one. It sure does not erase your mind.

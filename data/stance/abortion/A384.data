People who use graphical images of abortions to argue against it are actually quite lame. Have you seen any surgical operations done? It's quite horrific watching flesh sliced open, but should it be used to argue against surgical operations? All this graphical arguments are pathetic desperate measures to try and convince people it's ok to be forced to do something, that they should allow their rights regarding their own bodies to be taken away.  I say shame on you, all you horror and gore mongers.

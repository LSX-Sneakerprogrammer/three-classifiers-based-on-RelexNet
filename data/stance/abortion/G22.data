In the case of paralyzed or comatose patients, if a caretaker becomes unhappy with the situation, they are legally allowed to quit or otherwise cease their involvement. This is also not an issue of bodily autonomy.  The only evidence I need for the parasitism of the fetus is the definition of the word parasite: an organism that lives inside another organism (its host) and siphons resources without reciprocation. The fetus uses the mother's body as its host. It depends solely on her for survival; no one else can step in and take her place if she is unhappy with the situation. If someone or something is using your body to survive, you should have a say in whether or not it is allowed to continue doing so. You should be permitted to decide what medical procedures you will undergo or forego. If you do not get to decide this, then your rights to bodily autonomy are being infringed upon. When the interests of the fetus and the mother collide, the mother should take precedence.   This, more than a lack of consciousness in the fetus, is why I support abortion at the discretion of the mother and no one else.

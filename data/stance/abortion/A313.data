Does the Government check all moving cars for a seatbelt wearer? YOU are ridiculous.  A "serious invasion of privacy", you say? But forcing people to do something with their body is not??? Contradiction!   So, my suggestion is not ridiculous. YOU are ridiculous. YOUR arguments are ridiculous. YOU should go live in a country run by dictatorship. YOU should deal with YOUR unwanted pregnancies in YOUR OWN way.  Leave it alone. Abortion should not be banned.

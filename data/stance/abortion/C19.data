how can you compare a spider to a human life!   Both are equally alive. Both have their own respective niches. For example, can you make your own webbing, or inject venom?   a spider is not creative, a spider is not capable of love or emotion, a spider is not very productive, and a spider is an insect not a human.   You're arguing that a spider is not a human, not that a spider is less alive than a human.   plus a fudus if you want to call it that does have a mind or else it would not be able to curl its toes and suck it's thumb nor would it be able to grow!   A foetus has a brain, but it has no identity yet. A foetus is incomplete, like an empty shell.

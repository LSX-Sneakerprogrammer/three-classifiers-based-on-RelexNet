One thing we are taught in law is not to accept any fact until proper evidence is produced and you check those sources you produced and tell me what the problem is with them. You never used sources like that in an argument because of the validity of the facts become a question. Abortion is murder but became known as a woman's right to choose after the case Roe vs. Wade tried. Why do you think abortion in society was considered murder? Point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus?  So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well? Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.  Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus? Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?  Again, i am in Criminal Law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws. So it isnt about what you agree with or not, it is about what the laws are. Why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant, the District Attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused? The homicide laws comes into effect when the life of the mother is taken or when the life of the fetus istaken without the consent of the mother. Let me ask you this, if a licensed doctor performs an abortion on a woman without her permission or consent and knowledge, what do you think the DA will do? The DA will institute a chage of homicide?   But according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life (and i quote life not alive) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead. What part of this statement are you having a tough time with? Did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead? English is my first language. We are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence. I understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then? This is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states. That is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made. I dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life. I need evidence to back that up.   Every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it. The fetus is protected by human rights to certain extents.

I will ban you because you are over stepping your limits not because i care because you don't go around judging people and calling them names like you do. If you keep out of that then perhaps our debate will be good. I create the rules when i create my debates and if you question whether it is my debate or not then you are pushing me to show you whose court the ball is in.  In an argument the term pro choice refers to the killing of the fetus. Change it all you want but you will never be able to change the true meaning of the word. Pro Choice is another way of saying pro abortion. The question here is to kill or not to kill the fetus so i do not know what is the goal of your question? I want an answer not a meaningless question. Rape and Arson is in no way to compare to this topic because they do not even involve the taking of a human life and also both are morally wrong as in abortion where one side is considered morally wrong.  Are you in your right state of mind, then do me a favor and stop debating about abortion if you are not referring to it. Pro choice refers to the term supporting abortion.  I am not going to go further debating you. You are an immature idiot filled with nonsense. There is no point in even debating you. Maybe you should go back to junior high school and grow up. You have proved to me what stupidity is like so goodbye! And by the way it is not the length of the argument but the quality of the argument.

Why should the irresponsibility of the patents result in the death of the fetus?   First, I doubt that you can call the use of contraception "irresponsible". The fact that the contraception failed to prevent pregnancy does not mean that the parents were irresponsible, they were merely unlucky.  Second, your other premise is the the zygote is a human life. According to the OED, a zygote refers to "A body of living protoplasm, as a cell or cell-nucleus, formed by the conjugation or fusion of two such bodies in reproduction; a zygospore, or any germ-cell resulting from the union of two reproductive cells or gametes." While I admit that the zygote is "alive" in that sense, it does not have human rights because a zygote is not a sentient human being.

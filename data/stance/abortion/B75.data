Oh please....people have surgery all the time and talk about it. You are avoiding where I am taking you because your back is against the wall and you know it. No one talks about abortion because abortion is killing a living human being. That is fact. What woman wants people to know she did this?   If you value all life...the circumstances don't matter...only if the mother is dying on the table. Most people are pro-choice because they do not believe anyone should tell a woman what to do with their own bodies. Then they turn around and tell the woman she cant control it after the time they think its viable. Viability should not matter if you believe it is human and deserves the right to live.

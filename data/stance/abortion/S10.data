I believe that abortion should be legal because the fetus is simply a part of the mother's body and she can have an abortion because it is her human rights. Also I take this view because every woman can face with situation when two lives are at stake and the moral obligation is to save the one closest at hand--namely, that of the mother, whose life is always more immediate than that of the unborn child within her body.Or enother example, permission for an abortion could then be based on psychiatric considerations such as prepartum depression, especially if there is responsible psychiatric opinion that a continued pregnancy raises the strong probability of suicide in a clinically depressed patient. So, because of these reasons I believe that abortion should be legal.

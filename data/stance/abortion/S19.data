Should abortion be legal? It was like asking should murdering another person should be legal? I can't see the point why it should be legal in any sense. Abortion = murder. Why? Because you are planning to take the life of another human. Don't tell me that fetuses are not babies because in every single way they are. And if they are human they have all the right to live. You can have them be adopted if you are not ready with the child. Just don't take their first right away from them.   http://www.youtube.com/user/dcheckm8

I am really against abortion. I know that most of the abortions are cause by the teens because they aren't prepared to raise a child. First of all i don't think thats a good reason to kill a baby. There are always other options not just that. I come from a family of 10 people and my mom raised us all by her self aborting never crossed her head. So what I'm basically trying to say is that aborting is not a way to solve things so i think it should just be illegal.

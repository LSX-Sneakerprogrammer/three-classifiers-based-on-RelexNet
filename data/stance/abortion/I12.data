Abortion can only come down to one question: Is the fetus alive or not. If it is alive, then destroying it would be murder. The burden that a life may create should always take a back seat to that life being give a CHANCE to exist. We have no problem saying that James E. Holmes murdered in the movie theater in Colorado. What if some of those people had become a burden on their family? Is it suddenly NOT murder any more?   Also, the difference between a fetus that can be destroyed in a 'Partial-birth" abortion and a live baby that has full protection of the law is a distance of only a few inches down the birth canal. Killing it in the birth canal is the same as killing it in the womb.

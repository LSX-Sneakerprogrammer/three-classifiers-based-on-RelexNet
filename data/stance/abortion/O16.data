Why not? If you have an opinion on something, do you intend for it only to apply to you? Or to everyone? If you think smoking is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone. If you think killing is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for only you to do? Or for anyone to do?   No, of course each person has his own opinion, but most of people judge other people. A lot of people who are against abortion really judge those who are for abortion. But everybody has to have own opinion. I have mine, as well as you have yours.    Are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception? Or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species (ie sex)?   Hey, there are a lot of teenagers who become pregnant. I wrote it just as an example, because I know one girl who was in that situation.    Consider birth control before I had sex. Now that it is too late, I would accept responsibility for my actions, or inaction as the case may be.   Well, you would, but there are a lot of people who wouldn’t accept responsibility. As I said, I know someone who was in that situation, and it was really hard for her to make a choice.    Having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire. And you probably won’t ever forget about that either, in fact, you’ll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control.   Yes it is a good option, but it is very hard to give the baby up for adoption, when you gave a birth to him, when this little baby had been under your heart for 9 months. Also there could be any reasons why woman cannot be pregnant for this period. It is not so easy to be pregnant ‘alone’ (if we are talking about that bad situation)   Yes, people should think before having sex, but everybody makes mistakes. And everybody solves their problems as they can. Somebody is strong enough to take a responsibility for the baby, but somebody cannot. It is their choice. :)   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   You confused me. )) I didn’t get you. I didn’t mean lawful, or unlawful. I meant that by abortion people kill their babies.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.   A privilege? Don’t know. I think that a privilege is something that is given to someone after doing something good.   Everybody can be wrong. Do you agree with that? We cannot live without mistakes. It teaches us how to be better, by making mistakes we can understand what is right and what is wrong, or something like that.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   I agree with you, that we should take the responsibility in preventing mistakes. But there could be different situations, when people cannot control them. Somebody are not wise enough, somebody doesn’t think before doing something. But life is intended for us to self-perfection. It is a life. We learn from the mistakes of a lifetime. Somebody has to do his own mistakes to understand something, somebody can understand from the mistakes of others. People are different. That is why our life is very interesting. :)   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   In our society it wouldn’t be understandable if the offenders of homicide wouldn’t be punished. Of course they should be punished. But in my opinion they should be punished only be God. But our society wouldn’t accept it, and I understand why. We are living in the world where some people should be punished like going to jail or something like that, because it is a good way for other people to live quietly. So that offenders also can fix their mistakes after a jail, for example. They are also people. They just make more serious mistakes like murder, or something.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really fixit?   I think it is. In any case, it would be better then doing nothing, right? The most important thing when you understand you mistakes. Of course, a person cannot give a life for exactly that person he killed. :) it is impossible physically, but giving a life for somebody else is an answer too I think. Have you seen the film “Seven pounds” with Will Smith? This film describes what I am talking about very good. He killed 7 people, and it was his mistake. But after that he helped 7 other people. I understood that abortion is not so bad after watching it.    If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Yes, in my opinion, it is a best solution, but if for example the person from whom you stole is dead for example, you cannot give the money back to him. In that case, you can give them to somebody who needs it. may be for charity? )   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.   Yes, it is a good option, of course. But there are several options: to take responsibility for child and to bring him up yourself, to give him to an adoption agency, or to have an abortion. (there can be some other options, I don’t know). But each person should choose himself and to take responsibility for his actions and decisions.    If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.   A agree with you. But there are a lot of people who cannot take responsibility even for themselves, that is why we have a lot of options.   Of course, I wouldn’t have an abortion, because I love children and I want them, but I do not exclude it. If I would in a situation I described earlier, I would do it. But in other cases I wouldn’t.   But abortion is not wrong.   Abortion is an option. Option which is judged by someone, which is supported by someone, which is not understandable by someone, but a lot of women do it and they will do it in spite of other people’s opinions. And that is their choice.

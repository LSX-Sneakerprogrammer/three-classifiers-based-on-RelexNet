Until at least week 20 of its development, the fetus has not been proven to be able to survive outside of the mother's womb. Since society can't keep it alive, it's the mother's choice. Plain and simple.  My point: Until the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb, it's like any other living organ inside of her and is only a POTENTIAL life, not ACTUAL life. Potential life is any stage from an independent sperm/egg to week 20 of fetal development.

There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.   I'd like to hear one.   In some cases an abortion may be life saving to the pregnant woman. I don't think that a woman who chooses abortion to save her own life is committing an immoral act.   Taking the life of another person is an injustice   In general I agree that is true, but you yourself admit that sometimes it is justifiable to take a life DO YOU NOT?   If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?   I never said that "government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights". Whatever just authority it does have is derived from the consent of the governed.  How far do we let government go "protecting" us. There are a million more laws I'm sure that can be shoved down our throats in the name of protection. Our right to privacy applies at some point, and I think health care decisions made in a doctor's office merit that privacy from government intrusion.

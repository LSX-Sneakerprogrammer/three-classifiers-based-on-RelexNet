It is both.   Even if it was. Your statement was rude and counterproductive. What a decent person does is ask for clarification when they have trouble making sense of something.   That is obviously a hasty generalisation.   No it takes into account that most abortions are not due to medical necessity.   How can you say that I am rushing to ridicule when you haven't even seen my perspective on this issue?   Because you offered your scathing critique of Silaswash's writing style and left your response absent of anything that would give a clue as to your perspective regarding the subject being discussed.   You have claimed that abortion is an "unnecessary" surgery.   I didn't claim they all were.   You have also claimed that parents treat the life of their developing child like trash.   Well they are certainly not given a burial   Both of these claims are unasserted.   ~laughs~ I'll try to start making claims that  are  asserted, Mr. Intelligible.

It may not be a aware it alive but it is a life, so your killing a life and we say murder is wrong and we kill life and its ok?     Murder is about killing a person. Abortions terminate embryos which are just cells, they aren't people. The majority of the time, what is aborted cannot be construed in any rational sense to be a life in the sense of being a person.

... science is irrational  ... and pretending you hear the screams of things that haven't developed vocal cords is perfectly sane  got it, thanks for the heads up :/  These downvotes don't impress me either. I realize there is a religious coupe going on on create debate right now. But you'll get bored of being wrong eventually and move along to a site that will reinforce your misguided opinions instead of challenging them. Don't worry about saying good-bye, I hate long good byes and I tear up, you know, the emotion and all...

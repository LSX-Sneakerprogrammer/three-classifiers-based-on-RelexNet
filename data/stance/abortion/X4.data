A women should be able to choose what happens with her body, especially concerning abortion and babies.  Not because I support abortion, but what if you were the child of a mom?  What if that mom only had you grudgingly because she was forced to have you, abortions being outlawed?  Would you really want to grow up unloved? A child who's own mother would have aborted you?   Worse than an accident, you are a person whom the people you are supposed to love, and are supposed to love you would rather have had you dead than given birth to you.  In reality, it's not that bad, but forcing a mother to give birth to an unwanted child is cruel, and with the human population this high, with plenty of orphans already, why make more? Why go to the trouble and the pain for the mother, and the child, the entire family, and the whole world, when abortion could be an option?  I support safe sex and planned pregnancy, I think abortion is murder, as is war or any human killing another human, but killing does happen. Every time you eat, you are eating something that was killed, plant or animal.  If it reduces pain in the world, then you should be able to abort.

Sigh  yes, if you are referring to my potential life argument on the other side, it has everything to do with that specific argument. As for yours:   Killing the baby after a certain amount of weeks is painful to the baby   And you have proof of this I assume? Oh wait you don't? Of course not because it is not true.   If a man kills a pregnant women he is charged with two accounts of murder   This law in no way magically makes a fetus any more or less sentient. If I made a law that toasters were human, it would not make it so.   A born child effects a mother just as much as a baby. should all the mothers who think their children are to much of a burden be allowed to kill them   While listening to you now try to only refer to fetuses as babies, and so then needing to call a child a "born child" is hilarious, this sentence makes no sense. Everyone knows a "born child" should not be killed. That is not the issue, it is the cluster of cells within a woman that has no feelings and no personality which is the issue.   The issue doesn't seem to be whether it is a life form or not, but rather where it is and who it is effecting   Uh, what? Since when? No, the issue is that it is not a  person , and as such only an extension of the woman's body until about the third trimester, and so she should do with it what she chooses.  That pre-baby thing is  not  "someone" at all.  And there is nothing wrong with abortion.

if abortion was illegal it would still occur. it would be dangerous to the mother as well. it was legallised in england out of pity for the women who felt they had to resort to it, to protect their well being and the rest. it should stay legal, it will always be something that happens. some women perform self abortions with metal clothing hangers and end up dead. if abortion was not possible at all meaning whether illegal or not just not physically possible then i bet a lot of the women who desperately need them would kill themselves.

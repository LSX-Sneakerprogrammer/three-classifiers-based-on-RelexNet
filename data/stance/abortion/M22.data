It moves and has to be provided with nourishment and protection from the mothers womb. So it is not human? How is it not living? Thats like saying a fetus of a dog will not become a dog. Seriously? Please explain..... I really want to know your ideas. I think every woman and anyone that's for abortions, that has a voluntary abortion should have every reproduction organ removed from their body . My Aunt cannot have children and she wants one more than anything and some women are throwing them away like they were the fetus's are trash. Why won't they just have the baby and give it to someone like my aunt.   Do you realise that most abortions (over ninety percent) occur before the foetus even has brain tissue? Think about that for a moment. Everything that makes us what we are comes from our brain, but what's aborted in the vast majority of cases has NO brain. In many cases what's aborted is a microscopic bit of cells. This isn't the same as killing infants or babies, so you need to learn more about it and divorce yourself from that mindset.

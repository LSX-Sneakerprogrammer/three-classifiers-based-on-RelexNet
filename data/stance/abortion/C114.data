Yes, type in caps, we can hear you better that way.   IF YOU WANT TO GET TECHNICAL, IT ISN'T YOUR BODY EITHER.   If you want to get religious, perhaps. If you want to get technical, then it is your body.   THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT OUR BODY'S ARE A TEMPLE TO GOD.   The Bible is filled with horseshit.    HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR BIRTH AND OUR DEATH AND OUR LIFE ON EARTH IS TO BE A TESTAMENT TO HIM   No, your mother is responsible for your birth, you are responsible for your life and time is responsible for your death.

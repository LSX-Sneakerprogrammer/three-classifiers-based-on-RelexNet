You keep saying that it's human, which I agree with you. The points of difference seems to be that I regard it as a  potential  up to a certain point, whereas you think of it more as a  definite . You then argue that it deserves all the same rights as that of people. I don't agree I'm afraid. It doesn't deserve the same rights and you can call this discrimination based on level of development ;) (not based on level of dependency as you keep saying). Until it passes a certain stage in its development (mental and physical), it shouldn't have any rights whatsoever.

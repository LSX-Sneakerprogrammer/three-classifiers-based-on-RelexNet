Well, once it is a child, it already is illegal to kill it.  Before the first tri-mester it's a cluster of cells with no more self-awareness than a kitchen table.  So that wouldn't be "killing a child" at all.  And don't start with the potential bs. Because by that logic you would also have to outlaw masterbation, and save every ejaculation in a cup separating out the thousands of sperms representing "potential" life and finding female eggs to inject them in.  ... 'course judging by your past arguement, I guess you'll try anyway.

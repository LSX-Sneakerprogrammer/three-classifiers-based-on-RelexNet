I find some of these points shocking and sad. For instance, you minimize-no trivialize- the unborn human's instinct to live, eat survive. This is the very beginning of human life for god-sakes! It is not what is physically there in the womb which is at issue. Rather, it is the fact that this living thing inside the mother has input within it the POTENTIAL to grow. It is this instinct to develop, this fight to survive, to perpetuate itself which is beautiful and precious!! The potential is the important thing which is rare and precious, because one day you and I will both be dust with no more potential. So let's not let young ladies end it because it's hard to raise children and because it takes work.

I can't admit that of course because I am pro-life. Even in the case of incest and rape...the child is also the victim and has the right to life even though the mother had an act of violence thrust upon her. Abortion is also a violent and cruel act. We dont even abort animals like we do our own human children.   In what circumstances do you consider abortion if any murder?   Or do you just think all cases of abortion are ok?  What do you mean medical necessity? Do you mean the less than 1% of the cases when abortion is perform to save the mothers life? In most cases both can be saved.   If there is nothing wrong with abortion....why don't people talk about it like its just any other kind of surgery? It is the most common surgery performed in America today. Do you ever hear a woman say....gee I cant have lunch with you cause I have to have an abortion that day. OR hear a discussion about abortion at the Thanksgiving table? Or a mother tell her kids....about an abortion she had? Why don't people talk openly about abortion today, especially the women getting them? If its moral....then why the stigma? IS THERE SOMETHING MORALLY WRONG WITH ABORTION?

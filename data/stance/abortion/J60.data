I never made the claim that no one was able to view abortion without disgust. Heck some people can stand by while horrible things are done and not get the slightest bit upset. I need help because I'm failing to see where I've committed a logical fallacy. Break it down for me if you please. Treat me like a 3rd grade student.  I'll grant that an appeal to emotion isn't a rational way to demonstrate whether something is morally wrong or right, but frankly, I rather you but out unless you'd like to discuss how to (not just how not to)logically establish whether something is wrong or right.

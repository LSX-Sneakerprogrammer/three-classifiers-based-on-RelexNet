I personally believe abortion is an awful thing to consider for a person. If someone in my life tried to get an abortion, I would do everything in my power besides actually tying them to a chair to keep them from getting it. But I absolutely do not believe the government should ban abortion. That is completely out of their jurisdiction and authority. I believe greater education is the answer to prevent teen pregnancy and the fallacy that abortion is just another form of birth control. This will make the choice of aborting your child a much more serious question and the personal decision will be made more responsibly.

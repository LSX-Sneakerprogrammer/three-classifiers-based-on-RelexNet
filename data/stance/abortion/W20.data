I don't think we disagree over the question of when life begins. What we disagree over is whether it's wrong to kill non-intelligent life. I guess you could argue that a fertilized egg is technically human, if you're willing to stretch the definition of the word, but it is certainly not intelligent. You never have given me a good answer for why it's wrong to destroy non-intelligent life.

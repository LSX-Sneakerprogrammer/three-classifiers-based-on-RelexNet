The question is not about person-hood, but humanity and that is genetically verifiable. Answer the question, what kind of being is it? Everything else is superfluous.  And just so you know what side you stand on; your argument is similar to those who supported slavery,  they are not full persons and therefore have no rights under the law .  So let me qoute you using the word slavery in place of fetus and maybe you can see where you went wrong   Nothing about the right to slavery is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a slave is not a person.    Never in the history of U.S. law has a slave been a "person," and a slave is not a "person" under the law of Britain either.  A slave is property and therefore one can do with it as one sees fit.

Because, you know, there isn't a surplus of orphans or anything. =/  Should women who don't want kids have them anyway out of guilt for people who can't?  "and we have millions of people having sex and not being able to handle the consequences of pregnancy. if u have sex u better be ready to have babies too."  That's stupid. Just..... stupid. So a woman should go out of her way to NOT solve a problem just because she got herself into it? If you tripped and broke your arm should you NOT get a cast on it just because you were foolish enough to trip? maybe you shouldn't have been walking if you weren't ready to handle the possibility of breaking your arm. Maybe you should of had the good sense to wear a bubble-wrap suit. No? Why does that backwards logic only apply to abortion then?

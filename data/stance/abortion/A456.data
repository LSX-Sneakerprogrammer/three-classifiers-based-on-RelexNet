In a democratic society, it's the people that actually chooses to have a choice when it comes to their bodies... not propaganda (which the church excels at).   The church is wrong if it thinks Christians are turning a blind eye to the issue. The issue is very much alive and well amongs people, and they've clearly chosen not to have their rights meddled with!

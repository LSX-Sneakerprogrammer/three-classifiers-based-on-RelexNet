Do you actually read anything anyone types? I said babies as young as 22 weeks have survived hence I think they need to lower the gestation period.    without intervention no baby could survive birth without help   Seriously? Woman have been giving birth on their own for thousands of years. People still do. Gone are the days in America and the UK where you would crouch down in a field and push you're little sprite out. But more and more woman are opting for a natural intervention free home birth. And that's JUST in developed countries. In poorer countries they generally just get on with it.   Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life?   I'm not, the mother of the child is. And if she can't feed herself let alone provide for a child and she decides to abort that's her choice and perhaps a sensible one.   You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?   When did I say no one has a right to live? You're acting like I perform abortions on a daily basis. I said it's up to a mother if she wants to abort her child, I didn't say it's up to me.   You know Hitler had the same idea.........kill people who are undesirable....the Jew, the black the person of faith....dredges on society   Are you seriously comparing me to the Nazi that is Hitler? Really? Because I support a woman's  choice  to abort. You mad? You seem it.   Is that where you came up with the idea? Lets kill unborns because they MIGHT end up getting a divorce....lets kill them because they MIGHT be obese, they MIGHT end up being a drunk or abused, MIGHT become a criminal, MIGHT, MIGHT, MIGHT........... You would have aborted Oprah...she was born into poverty.    Can we just make it perfectly clear that I do not control worldwide abortion. Nor am I responsible for abortion. Nor do I make a choice for anyone to abort. Why are you blaming me for every abortion a woman decides to have because I believe she has the right to that choice? You have read way too much into a small paragraph I wrote. I simply gave reasons why a woman might choose to abort and supported that. I don't remember saying "HEY YOU THERE! ABORT YOUR BABY IT MIGHT BE FAT!".   What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?   What? I've never made a choice for anyone to live or die or wanted/had the right.   It is a scientific fact that the sperm in a male is human, t is a fact that the eggs in a female is human   Does that mean if someone masturbates they are aborting a human life? Does that mean when a woman menstruates she is aborting a human life? They are not human until they meet, implant and develop.    I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts   Stop talking to me about conception, I've had a child I know how it works.   What is the goal of every abortionist?   To do what they  feel  is right for them and their unborn child.  Let me ask you a question now. I have contraceptive coil in to stop me from getting pregnant. Do you think I am aborting human life?

so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?   Yes, in the case that the lower-awareness individual cannot speak, or even comprehend their rights, for example. I suppose I should have added the qualifier that when the difference between awareness is so great that one of the individuals cannot even understand their situation, it seems reasonable to give custody of the body to the other who can.   If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.    It has all within its scope which care about foetal awareness. Some arguments are purely rights based, and see the mother as executive over her body.  With regards to AFS, I think the primary way it can be used without being seen as arbitrary is that if we find that a foetus isn't developed enough to be aware of its environment, then it isn't perceived as cruel to end its life because it isn't even aware of what it lost. I suppose this can be thought of as a stretch on the saying "What he doesn't know won't hurt him." This I believe is also a way to justify euthanasia (such as for deep-coma patients) because it is currently understood that they aren't even aware of their existence. So in other words under these contexts, an AFS isn't an argument for what the person will or may feel in the near future, but instead an argument used to justify a procedure as not being cruel to the recipient presently. Another strain of it arguably appears when we feel consoled when a person dies in their sleep, it is seen as less violent or cruel for that person to die while not aware of it.  An AFB would have the benefit of allowing human clones who are born without brains (beyond what is necessary for autonomic functions I suppose) to exist rationally to serve as organ hosts.  The UPA argument is the hardest to defend because as we both saw, it relies on a very grey boundary of what we feel is "too soon" or "too late." Science will be our best friend here, but we must always remember how life is rarely divided into discreet units that are easily divided.

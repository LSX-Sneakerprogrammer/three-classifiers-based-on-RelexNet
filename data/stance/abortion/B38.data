She has a right to unhook herself...but she is not slaughtering the child. The child might die might not....nature takes it course.  The fetus in the womb is not dying on its own its fine. The mother pays someone to kill it. This is totally different.   So since you are pro-abortion....I assume you are pro-abortion since you do give the woman the right it is her body.....to kill it even after nine months.  Got one for ya. The woman is in scheduled for a csection in one week. She gets scared and decides that she does not want the baby. Is perfectly acceptable for her to kill it at nine months?  The woman took the risk that she might get pregnant. If she did not want a baby she should not have had sex, or done something to prevent it like sterilization.   And for your information the baby is not part of the mother. It has its own DNA, bodily systems, heart, circulatory system, fingerprints. If the baby is part of the mother....do you think that she should be able to kill it after its born?

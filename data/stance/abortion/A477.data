Though i don't think i would be able to get an abortion because i hate big medical procedures i don't see why other people shouldn't or can't. There is not a limit on how many children a women can have, meaning if a women gets an abortion that is not one less child she can have on the future. Most only want 2 or 3 she can still have those 2 or 3 children. At the stage of pregnancy when abortions happen the baby obviously wouldnt be able to live if it was taken out of the womb that early, so is it really considered alive in the womb even if it has a heartbeat. It isn't until the 6th or 7th month that baby might have a chance of surviving if it is taken out early. People say that if it was a mistake you should have been more careful and should deal with it. But if there is a way to fix it it why is it bad? Abortion is in no way an easy route there are consequences and it is punishment enough for a mistake. And if the baby was formed without the mothers consent she whould be able to get rid of it as to not be reminded of the forced father.

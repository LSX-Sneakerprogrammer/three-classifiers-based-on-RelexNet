Omgosh....what a wonderful and refreshing post. Not used to seeing ones like yours....most people here are pro-abortion and do not value all life.   What you said about killing and cruelty to pets is right on. Hollywood especially will go out of its way to bash people for this...then be first in line to support killing human beings. One answer for them to just be promiscuous.

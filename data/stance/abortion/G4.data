So are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it? Then why are you even against abortion? We are talking about a life here not just a fetus. I believe that everyone has a right to live. No fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother. In the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt.  If you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions. What if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion? What is your opinion on that?

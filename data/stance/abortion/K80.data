I agree that abortion is murder, but people who side with the pro-choice front don't think that way. They don't believe that the fetus is alive until a certain point in development, or birth in some opinions. I believe life begins at conception and I have based this on biological and scientific knowledge. However, many pro-choice advocates don't believe life begins until the heart beats or until the fetus moves for the first time, etc. That's where the true debate is.

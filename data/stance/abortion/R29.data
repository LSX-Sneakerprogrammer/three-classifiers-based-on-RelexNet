since abortion became legal in the US in 1973 50 million abortions have been performed. that would knock out 15 states with no1 in them. that ridiculous. there are millions of people in the world who would love to have children but cant. and we have millions of people having sex and not being able to handle the consequences of pregnancy. if u have sex u better be ready to have babies too.

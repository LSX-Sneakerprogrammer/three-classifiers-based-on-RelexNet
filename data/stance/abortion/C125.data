why shouldn't it matter?   It isn't a life yet. You are a life, I am a life. We have memories, minds, identities. A foetus has none of this, it is alive without being a proper life.  That is why there is no problem with it.   Doesn't everything deserve a chance?   Rationally speaking, no. Life has limited resources, and one of those resources is family. Only so many loving, positive families exist, and abortion prevents a a child from being raised as a burden. Why would you want a child to be raised in a family that was unprepared? Why should a child exist in a loveless or incompetent family? Why should a child become an orphan? Children need deep emotional bonds to become good people. You are supporting a belief that causes inconvenient children to roam the world, growing up into social problems and criminal elements.   The fetus can't even protect itself or have any say in it.    That's because a foetus isn't self-aware. It's a protohuman, it may be alive but it isn't aware of itself.   That's not fair to just say "I'm going to end something/someone's life and there is absolutely nothing nobody can do about it."    I believe the abortion issue of today evolved with the far right's displeasure of reduced gender roles brought on by feminism. Abortion is the ultimate sign of a woman's ownership of her body. Something that was traditionally left up to chance is now within her control, and a man can no longer force her to become a mother who stays at home, giving up her dreams. It is her choice now, too. I think that abortion is one of those emotional issues which everyone has a feeling about, but as a matter of private thought, yet politicians capitalised upon it as a means of dividing people and pulling them to support a movement they might otherwise ignore.   In other words, abortion like pregnancy is a private issue that is frankly none of our business when it concerns someone else. The reason we keep it legal is so that a woman may choose to exercise control over her body should the need arise.

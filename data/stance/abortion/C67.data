Hosea 13:15-16   “I will have no compassion,  even though he thrives among his brothers.  An east wind from the Lord will come,  blowing in from the desert;  his spring will fail  and his well dry up.  His storehouse will be plundered  of all its treasures.  The people of Samaria must bear their guilt,  because they have rebelled against their God.  They will fall by the sword;  their little ones will be dashed to the ground,  their pregnant women ripped open.”   1 Samuel 15:1-3   Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord. This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’”    Deuteronomy 21:18-21   If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.” Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.   In other words, the bible teaches us that god cares nothing for the lives of children. Indeed, abortion would be godly behaviour, and don't you wish to emulate god?

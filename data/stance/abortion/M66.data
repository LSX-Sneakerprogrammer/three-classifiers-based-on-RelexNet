And sex cells. ;) But besides that, that wasn't my point.     Then don't make it your point. you were the one that listed "it has all the chromosomes" as a reason it was a person. If it's not a reason, don't list it.  Now what am i supposed to think... "not part of something else" makes something a person? Do I really need to bother with the tearing apart of that one ? Besides being a silly criteria in and of itself, you do realize that the fetus doesn't stop being part of something else until the umbilical is cut?  There is one defining criteria of people that makes them people. It is very obvious what it is. "Cogito ergo Sum" isn't just a catchy saying. You're dancing around it listing these peripheral attributes like possession of chromosomes and structural coherence because you know that the fetus doesn't possess the primary one that actually matters.

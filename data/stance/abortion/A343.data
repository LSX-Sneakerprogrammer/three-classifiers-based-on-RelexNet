Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thing. It's an entirely different debate.  A fetus that's not capable of survival without being directly attached to its mother via the umbilical cord is still not yet a person that merits society's involvement. It is the mother's property until this point and she must have the choice of keeping it or not. You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself. If you can keep the baby alive with milk then by all means take it out and do that if you want. The mother doesn't have to be involved any more.

1. We are all just a cluster of cells. There are some people who are never self-aware due to mental diseases. There are some people who don't feel pain because of neurological disorders. This hardly disqualifies them from humanity.  2. I agree that in life-or-death situations, the doctors have to make a call to save the mother or the baby. This is atypical, however, and only happens in about 2-3% of all cases.  3. The issue is not whether or not people are forced to have abortions. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. If abortion is murder, then we have a problem. We should not think the legalization of murder is ok just because no one is forcing us to murder others.  4. This applies to murder, rape, theft, and every other crime. Of course it won't stop some people from doing it, but it will allow for law enforcement to punish for committing crimes. It will also help to educate youth on what is morally acceptable and what is morally horrid.  5. This issue is moot if a fetus is an individual human life. We shouldn't legalize murder to make it less hazardous to the murderer. Besides this rape is never the fault of the baby, so how does anyone have a right to kill it?

And is abortion for social reasons ok?   I'll repeat it again. No. They are not okay.    You said they are wrong....  WHEN?   You make out one night and then get pregnant and then you do an abortion. That is wrong.  You kill a baby cuz your unhappy with it's sex kind.  You kill a baby cuz you are not ready for one.  You kill a baby cuz you were raped and that baby is unwanted. I'm sure you don't reckon or enjoy it's birth. But, that gives no one a right to kill a baby.  I believe that abortions are a strict no until really required.  If the mom is incapable of the birth process or is too weak or may communicate a murderous disease or until your life is at the stake.  I'm glad that you are fighting for the right of the 99% of the unborn. I appreciate the fact that there a certain few who are involved. You fight for those who are killed for social reasons. But, I'm trying to explain that there is no need to be so cross about this process. At a level, the strictness must be loosened and all the guilt saved. There must be exceptions. Valid exceptions.

"it is the same as killing an adult or a child"... No, it is not. It is only a POTENTIAL life and not ACTUAL life. Before week 20, the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's womb. It must be attached to her and be supplied with her blood. If society can't keep it alive, then society should not make laws forcing mothers to keep their unwanted pregnancies. It is physically attached to her and is a part of her and must be her choice.

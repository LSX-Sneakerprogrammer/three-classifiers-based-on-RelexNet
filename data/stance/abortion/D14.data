Exactly how would you enforce such a law? Would you set up gov't intervention to pregnancy test ALL eligible females monthly? What would be the cost? Will it be a federal program or a state program? What if a woman has a miscarriage? How will they prove that. What you're all asking for is a police state in a woman's uterus. You're basically calling it Government Property. When you do these things, you violate a woman's civil rights. Once you take away a woman's civil rights, then the gov't will just move on and take everyone's away. Then you can just relax in your ChristoFascist America.

If you kill a child, I'd kill you myself if I could. But we're not talking about children or babies here are we? so don't try to change the definition of a fetus to suit your arguments because that definition is simply wrong.  Don't try and force me to have children when I don't want to. They're fetuses. I make them and I can break them and make some more, it's a difficult decision when I have to abort them, but when I'm ready to have children I will have children, not when you think I'm ready. It makes no difference to your life, but it has a massive impact on mine so don't butt in! Women who've had abortions have gone on to have children later on when they're ready.  You claim to represent mothers who've chosen to keep their babies - good for you, but here's a news flash: they don't actually need you to represent them! They don't need you to argue that they should be allowed to keep their babies, nobody's trying to stop them! So it's a great position of risk that you've placed yourself in. A very challenging role! I don't know how you do it!

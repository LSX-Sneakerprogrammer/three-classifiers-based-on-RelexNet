First of all, don't argue about something you can't even spell correctly.   I try to give people a little leeway on this site unless their grammar is just ostentatiously bad or makes what they are saying ambiguous, etc.  Otherwise, you end up calling someone out for spelling  foetus/fetus  in a perfectly acceptable way even if it is not the way you are used to.

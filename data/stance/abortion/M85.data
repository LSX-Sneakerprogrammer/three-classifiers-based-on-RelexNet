Has teenage sex been rising or falling since sex education has been introduced?  Yes, there are tons of other reasons for this correlation. Sex is everywhere. Should it be in schools too? Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex? If you're going to start teaching them atleast do it once they're legally allowed to have sex. Maybe sex education could lead to a decrease in sexual activity - but with a conservative, not a liberal attitude.   I highly doubt she would go off and do it again, not till she is ready.   You're wrong. They do it again all the time.  Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays (that's not including rape). Because of the attitude that it's ok to have sex aslong as you 'love' them. But we all know that until the age of atleast 19 (and that's still young) nobody understands love. In the end the messege leads to - have sex with the person you're with, not the person you 'love'.  Look what happened when kids were kept in the dark. They didn't have tons of underage sex. Maybe that's because it was different times and there weren't tits in their face every other second. But atleast if you're going to teach them about it - teach them that it's wrong to have sex until after you're 16/18/21 or w/e.

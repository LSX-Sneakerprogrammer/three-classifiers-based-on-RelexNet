Why are you bringing religion into this. Lets debate this from a scientific point of view. Tell me what science says about it.   You always know when someone loses it... they start swearing. Why should you be taken seriously when your potty mouth speaks more than the content of what you are saying? Shows a lack of knowledge and class.   And by the way....who says God causes miscarriages? Can't they be an act of nature? You hate God/idea of God so much that you can't even control your emotions. LOL  Jesus does not perform abortions. The woman walks in on her own, hires someone to kill the living human being inside her....that is an abortion. This is not a miscarriage.   Your so empty....

The responsiblity is HERS   Stop saying this the man is half responsible for pregnancy he had sex and impregnated. Pregnancy is the responsibility of two people.    You think this is just a womans issue, that the father who has DNA in the newly created human being should not have a say in the matter of whether his child is killed or not   I'm sorry I must have missed saying that men have no right to decide if his child is aborted. Oh wait that's because I didn't say that... My claims of you being sexist are because what you said  is  sexist. You're just trying to stipulate what I think when I have not said anything along the lines of males shouldn't be involved or have a say.    You want the father to pay, only if SHE decides to have the child...and in that case you would go after him for child support   Huh? Every woman that has a child is single and goes after the father for child support? Not that this has any relevance to abortion since the child would have to be born for a father to pay for it.   The man deposits the sperm.....and that is it. She allows him to do this   Sexist again. He allows himself to do it as much as she allows him.    THEN WHY DENY HIM THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHILD   I don't deny him the right. The mother does, not once have I said this is right or correct. Stop putting words into my mouth. And they aren't always denied the right anyway. A lot of woman consult with the father before having a termination.   and your giving her a pity party   So any father who provides for his child, within a relationship or not, is simply giving their child money out of pity? Don't be so idiotic. And stop implying that all a father does is pay money he cares for the child as much as the mother. And by the way, damn right he should pay. He had sex without contraception he knew the consequences as much as the woman, he should be involved with providing financially as much the mother!    Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried   Since a unborn baby relies on the mother to provide for it through the umbilical cord of course it's a part of her. The embryo didn't rely on the petri dish to nurture and nourish it.   But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   I try my best to avoid getting angry but you just keep making up awful lies about me. I not once said anyone isn't worthy to live or deserves to die. I said I understand if a woman wants to have an abortion for these reasons.   You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic.   Who did I blame? When did I say a woman is dragged into an abortion clinic?  Look debate with me all you like but don't for one moment assume that you know everything about my opinions and thoughts. Instead of accusing me of ludicrous opinions and awful things that I have said not said perhaps ask for my view on a topic.

Destroying a fetus is like destroying a part of yourself. One's genes, blood and cells are within the body of a their fetus, yet they undergo an abortion and prevent a human life from being lived.

We cannot think for ourselves, nor can we comprehend good or bad. On this basis, infants are also considered innocent. Why deny life to something that does not deserve such a fate?

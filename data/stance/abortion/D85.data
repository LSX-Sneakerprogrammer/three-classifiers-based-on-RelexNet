I don't think that is an age where you necessarily fully understand consequences, vies change when people get older. It's that time when everyone wants to have fun.  As for adoption, the baby is going to have to be born but it's even more painful never knowing who their true parents are and always questioning it.   Abortion seems a way to fully erase one's mind of the error they had made.

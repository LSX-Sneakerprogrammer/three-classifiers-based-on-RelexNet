Fetuses are capable of responding to stimuli. brain development begins in the early embryonic period or at week 5 of pregnancy  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ prenatal-care/PR00112      Brain development doesn't imply having a proper brain. It takes weeks before the brain resembles anything complex. IDX takes place around 16 weeks, and at that point the fetus has an actual brain.   later on as a fetus they can sense and respond, they can kick and punch. New born babies can recognizes the cadence of their parents language, they learn that stuff well in the womb.  http://www.babycenter.com/ 404_ is-it-true-that-babies-can-recognize- their-mothers-voice-at_10323727.bc      Alright, you demonstrated some memory and stimuli response. Assuming it is partially aware of its surroundings, it is still sub-human in its cognitive functions, meaning many simple animals are more self-aware. This allows for a rational decision in favour of the mother's right over her own body.   The future ramifications of a choice does factor in to making laws; Laws are all about that. The texting and driving laws are about the future ramifications of allowing or not allowing different groups(age based) to text and drive. The question asked is the following: Will banning it decrease crashes? the word "will" is a reference to the future.    You're mistaking laws which exist to prevent accidents, using statistics to back their premises, with a law which would make an operation illegal because the present life it ends would in the future be a life.  In other words, the first types of laws are about minimising the chance of damage. Chance is the operative word. The second hypothetical law is about preventing an operating from occurring because only in the future will it have ethical problems. The distinguishing feature is that one set of laws is based on chance accident prevention, the other is based upon the rights bestowed to a person only in a hypothetical future, in other words treating a present nonentity as a future person.  Going back to my condom example, the example was reducing your argument to its extremes. A condom has sperm which if allowed to fertilise an egg will become a foetus, then a child. Wasting the condom therefore would be the same as wasting a child's life, using your reasoning.   what is meant by individuality? the zygote has its own dna pattern. it is individual, unique. I have a feeling you mean something different?   Individuality comes from the memories you have. Clones exist as part of nature, but they are still separate individuals because they experience different memories.   the first two weeks of pregnancy your not actually pregnant according to the first article mentioned in the above, there is most certainly nothing wrong with doing something with in that time period to insure you don't become pregnant.    I would argue that since we are already dealing with a known individual, the woman, who already has legal rights bestowed upon her as an individual, the decision of whose rights should prevail is fairly simple. It hasn't been established even remotely that the foetuses which are aborted in over 90% of cases are individuals.

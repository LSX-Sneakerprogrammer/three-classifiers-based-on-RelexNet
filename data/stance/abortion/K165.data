I don't care what the facts are you are still killing a life that either will become one or is already one. It is still the same in my opinion no matter what. Shut up "get your facts straight."     Over 50% of abortions don't even involve a foetus.  The remaining 40% involve a foetus that doesn't even have a heart.   The last 10% involve later term abortions.  The facts say that it isn't a life in at least 90% of abortions. Opinions are worthless.

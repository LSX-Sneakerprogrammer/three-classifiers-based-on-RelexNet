her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK   I can assure the only person who looks silly here is you. A man is HALF the responsibility of a  pregnancy . It's not my fault that a man has no say in abortion maybe if you actually read what I type you would of seen me say that it's probably unfair that a man by law is denied a say. However in a lot of circumstances the woman consults with the man and they come to a mutual agreement on whether to continue the pregnancy or not.   Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is   A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk. They are both equally responsible for a  pregnancy . I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.   It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.   It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me? Here is one of Margaret's views  advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called "socially undesirable people"  so I'm a racist now? And there is a massive difference here for a start. I don't believe anyone should be  forced  to have an abortion it's their  choice .   And another  She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers, and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf, blind and dependent. She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I  think  abortion is okay.   it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb   If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?

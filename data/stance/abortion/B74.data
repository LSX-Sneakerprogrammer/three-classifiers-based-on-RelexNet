If there is nothing wrong with abortion....why don't people talk about it like its just any other kind of surgery?   Your surgery opinion is stupid. I never had someone, unless I knew them on a highly personal level, talk about surgery. When was the last time someone waltzed up to you in work and said "hey, today I'm having a groin abcess drained!"   In what circumstances do you consider abortion if any murder?   This the UK abortion act.  To comply with the 1967 Abortion Act, two doctors must give their consent, stating that to continue with the pregnancy would present a risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing children.  This is my view entirely. You can't pin point exact opinions or 'when is it murder' because it  always  depends on circumstance. If you mean gestation I can't answer that because it's purely scientific but I personally believe once a baby is a viable living age.

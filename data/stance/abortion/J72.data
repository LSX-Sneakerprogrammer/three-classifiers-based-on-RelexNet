I don't want it shown because, unlike what you said, it's false. Abortion is NOT done like that anymore. Nor is it done this late unless the mother is in danger. Look it up.   And this picture is not gross to me, or disturbing. It's fake, and it's a ridiculous way to move people to be pro-life.  No pro-choice person has a problem with the picture itself, just that it's false.   Also, of course it would "tug on your heartstrings" the later a fetus is in term the more it is responsive. I don't have a problem with getting rid of a clump of cells in early abortion.

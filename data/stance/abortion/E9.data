I think abortion should be banned because Abortion eliminates the potential societal contributions of a future human being. An example : "After tens of millions of [abortion] 'procedures', has America lost anything? Another Edison, perhaps? A Gershwin? A Babe Ruth? A Duke Ellington? â€¦ As it is, we will never know what abortion has cost us all.

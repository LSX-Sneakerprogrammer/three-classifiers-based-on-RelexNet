No you are making it up from your limited understanding of what it means to exist...otherwise please post some evidence that foetuses are mindless and unaware.   I already argued from the known facts. Sorry if this topic is so matter of fact, but I don't find the subject particularly challenging. A man named casper on this website and I discussed at length the criteria for awareness in foetal minds, and his was an illuminating discussion. You are simply making touchy-feely arguments.

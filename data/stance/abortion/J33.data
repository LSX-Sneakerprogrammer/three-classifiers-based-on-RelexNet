My argument is very simple.   By having sex, one acknowledges the possible repercussions of that act. Primarily being 1) being impregnated and 2) getting an STD.   By having sex, one realizes it might end up Ina pregnancy. No form of protection is 100% effective. So anyone having sex should be able to have the responsibility of having a child.   Why should the irresponsibility of the patents result in the death of the fetus? It is life. It is human life from a few hours after conception when the gander has become a zygote with the DNA addition of the father. The killing of human life is not a fair outcome for someone not at fault for anything.

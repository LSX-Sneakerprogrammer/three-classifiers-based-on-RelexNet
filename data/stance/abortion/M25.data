Even if it doesn't have a brain, my belief is that the PERSON still has a soul. The soul is what gives the PERSON LIFE The bible says once you are conceived the chosen PERSON has a given soul that the Lord has chose for you. Please do not argue with my spiritual beliefs, i have chose to believe in God and the law protects that.

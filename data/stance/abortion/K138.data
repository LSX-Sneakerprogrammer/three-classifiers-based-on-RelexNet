The only time an abortion is allowed is when the continuation of the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk! Otherwise, under whatever circumstances, abortion is a crime.. It's a crime against the unborn baby; against the mother - even if she doesn't want the baby(for a further explained reason); against humanity and our morals and most importantly against God.. Even if this pregnancy occurred due to unsafe sex or it was unexpected by a couple, no one has the right to object to what God has created.. If it's because of unsafe sex, when are you going to take responsibility of your own life and live with the consequences of your mistakes?! It is therefore your duty to have that baby because you chose to have sex ignorantly.. Who, nowadays, is not educated enough to know that somehow unsafe sex can lead to pregnancy?! In the case where you were "raped", then i suggest you get yourself together and talk about what happened to you before it's too late and you'd be more miserable than ever.. In the case where the pregnancy is unexpected - or so it's called - why do you think it happened in the first place?! Everything happens for a reason and only God knows why.. so again, who are you to question fate?! No one has the right to decide the fate of another creature.. NO ONE! but God...

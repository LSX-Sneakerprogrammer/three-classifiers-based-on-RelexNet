"well why would people say that kind of things!!??"  Because it's true, would be the most obvious conclusion...  "i mean its not like your mom aborted you..."  Non-sequiter. Just because my mom planned and kept me doesn't mean everyone else should or will do the same with their children.  "and the babies or unborn fetus have as many rights as you and i have to live!"  By "right" you, of course, mean, "in my personal preference" as the word "right" means nothing outside of your ability to label things as such.  Until the child is born it is just a parasite. Not much difference between it and a tapeworm. Would you get rid of a tapeworm?  Perhaps you would keep the unborn child because you want to give birth to it and love it later in life, but then this is just a matter of YOUR personal preference and should ONLY be considered in the matter of your own child. Not every woman is required to keep a fetus they wont love just to appease YOUR preferences.  Or are you egotistical enough to claim that only your way of life is correct?

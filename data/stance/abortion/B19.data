They can have sex, but they must be prepared to deal with the result of it. Since when was sex the only thing that kept together a marriage? The purpose of marriage is to start a family, which includes supporting each other in BOTH good times and BAD. If you aren't trying to start a family then GTFO :)  A childless couple isn't acting irresponsibly if they are prepared to take responsibility if they have sex.

Frankly, anyone has the right to abortion because of free will and liberty, and nobody has the right to tell anyone what to do with their body.  HOWEVER,  The only problem I have is the definition of fetus and human.  If it is isn't murder, then why is that when a person murders a pregnant woman, whom is carrying a fetus, is charged with double homicide? How can that be? Where is the justice? Shouldn't it be only homicide? The person did in fact murder only one person because the fetus is not human

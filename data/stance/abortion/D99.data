mmb98, they were only quoting the Declaration of Independence. And I assume this discussion is for legality in America? So really the argument doesn't crumble at the beginning at all. In fact, it starts at the beginning, of this country.   And an interesting idea, life before liberty. B/c the pro-abortion crowd considers themselves "pro-choice", but they deny life in order to have choice. Do you think they'd agree if we deny their life for one of my choices?

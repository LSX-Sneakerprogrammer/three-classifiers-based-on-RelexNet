Ok, I'm amazed you're actually being this ridiculous about a simple name.   Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortion…there is no difference.   Pro abortion means you want abortions. Pro choice means you want the choice of abortions. There is a  big  difference.  I do not like that people get abortions. I simply think it's the lesser evil of two, especially when you look at statistics that show that abortion laws don't stop abortions, they just stop safe abortions. This leads to major risks to both the baby and the mother.  It's common for pro lifers to accuse pro-choice supporters of being blind to the facts, when it is they who rarely actually consider the women that they're condemning.   Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?   I think it's bad, I'm asking you why it's so bad. You haven't answered any of my questions, you've simply said that it's bad and that it's the same as pro-abort.   Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months?   Please talk about questions that are actually up for debate, you're wasting your time, attacking something that isn't there.   “Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.”   Useless circular rhetoric, sounds clever, but it proves nothing.

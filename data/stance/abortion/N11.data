1. Your fingernails and hair do not make up the whole of you as a human. Without your hair or fingernails you would survive. On the contrary, abortion kills the entire individual organism.  2. That whole issue is inconsequential.  3. Science is silent on the issue of morality. However science does agree that the fetus has an individual genetic code and fits into the biological definition of life. It is an individual human by all biological standards. It is in no way a part of the mother, it just depends on the mother for survival (and so are children outside the womb). Because of this it is deserving of all human rights everyone else has. Unless you can show it is not an individual human or it is not alive, anything else is superfluous.  4. You're just stating the positive side of the coin whereas I said the negative.  5. You're refusing to answer the basic data over and over. Please share how a human fetus is not alive or how it is not an individual with a unique genetic code.

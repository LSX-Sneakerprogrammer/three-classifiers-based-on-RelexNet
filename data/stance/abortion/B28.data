Another moral relativist......sigh....  If there is nothing wrong with abortion then how can you say abortion is wrong after 24 weeks? My neice was born at 23 weeks and last year graduated from college. Although it was a long road...she is normal, in fact she is brilliant and graduated with over a 4.4 grade point. To say...that 24 weeks is the cutoff time is wrong. But then...tell me cattiscus...is abortion wrong? And just to let you know.....without intervention no baby could survive birth without help. One who is born earlier than 40 weeks just might need additional help.  Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy. They say the happiest people live in poorer countries. You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?   You know Hitler had the same idea.........kill people who are undesirable....the Jew, the black the person of faith....dredges on society. Is that where you came up with the idea? Lets kill unborns because they MIGHT end up getting a divorce....lets kill them because they MIGHT be obese, they MIGHT end up being a drunk or abused, MIGHT become a criminal, MIGHT, MIGHT, MIGHT........... You would have aborted Oprah...she was born into poverty.   What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?  It is a scientific fact that the sperm in a male is human, it is a fact that the eggs in a female is human.....when the sperm of a male homosapien meets the egg of a female homosapien.........starts another separate HUMAN BEING, who has its own organs, finderprints and DNA. Louise Brown the first test tube baby was NOT APART OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE WAS CONCEIVED. She began her life in a petri dish. She was a human being from conception. Could she sing the Star Spangled Banner, do times tables, drive a car? No But can a baby who is just born do any of those tasks? No   HUMAN EMBRYOLOGY, by Dr. Bradley M. Patten.  He states, "It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermaozoan and the resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual."   Dr. Keith Moore's text on embryology, referring to the single-cell zygote says, "The cell results from fertilization of an oocyte by a sperm and is the beginning of a human being. He also states, "Each of us stated life as a cell called a zygote."  Dr. Keith Moore, the Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 2d ed. (Philadelphia, Penn)  J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics (New York : McGraw Hill) In their work on biology and obstetrics, state, “The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.”  Dr. Louis Fridhandler, in the medical textbook “Gametogenesis to Implantation Biology of Gestation,” vol.1, ed. N.S. Assau (New York: Academic Press) refers to fertilization as “that wondrous moment that marks the beginning of life for a new unique individual.”    Doctors, E.L. Potter and J.M Craig write in Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed. (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers) “Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition.”  These doctors tesified before a United States Senate Committee on life.   Dr. Alfred Bongioanni, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.  He said, “I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life….I am no more prepared to say that these early stages of development in the womb represents an incomplete human being than I would be to say that prior to the dramatic effects of puberty….is not a human being. This is human life at every stage.”  Dr Jerome LeJeune, professor of genetics at the University of Descartes, Paris France. He is the doctor who discovered the chromosome pattern of Down syndrome. He says” after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. This is no longer a matter of taste or opinion and not a metaphysical contention; it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning at conception.”  Professor Hymie Gordon, Mayo Clinic: “By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.”  I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts...but would it really matter or affect your views on abortion?   Could you just answer this one question for me. What is the goal of every abortionist?

So a woman should go out of her way to NOT solve a problem just because she got herself into it?   It is not a problem, it is a life.   If you tripped and broke your arm should you NOT get a cast on it just because you were foolish enough to trip?   A broken arm is an injury, easily mended. When a person's life ends, there can be to going back.   Why does that backwards logic only apply to abortion then?   It is in no way backward logic. You are equating a human life to a broken bone. If it weren't for that life there would be no bone to break!

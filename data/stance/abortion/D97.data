If a lack of an informed conscious means you can't make decisions for yourself, then Terry Schiavo's husband was right in starving her to death. She never made a formal living will so there is no statement on file as to what her wishes were.  If your method of reasoning fails, any person who falls into a coma unexpectedly would be at the mercy of whoever has to take care of them. If you don't say you want to live, anyone can kill you?  By the way, the 'church' tax breaks also extend to organized atheists; in case you wanted to file an amended return.

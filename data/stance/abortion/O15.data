When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Why not? If you have an opinion on something, do you intend for it only to apply to you? Or to everyone? If you think smoking is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone. If you think killing is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for only you to do? Or for anyone to do?   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant.   Are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception? Or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species (ie sex)?    You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do?   Consider birth control before I had sex. Now that it is too late, I would accept responsibility for my actions, or inaction as the case may be.    Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong?   No, I wouldn’t want to end the life of the fetus because the fetus having been conceived are direct results of my irresponsibility in not using birth control or making the guy use it (assuming we are not talking about an immaculate conception). Religious ethics based on the idea of ‘sin’ or ‘evil’ has no effect on my decision; it’s about how I was raised.   What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire. And you probably won’t ever forget about that either, in fact, you’ll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control.   Abortion is a murder.   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   But everybody has a right to be wrong.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.    Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion.   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really  fix  it?   How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.  I am totally against abortion as a form of birth control when actions can be taken to prevent conception in the first place. As for situations of rape or failed preventative birth control, i am pretty much indifferent about whether or not a woman want's to be a mom or have an abortion. I don't care about abortion in as much as a person being responsible for their actions. If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.

Abortion: Gives a mother a choice in carrying a life form for 9 months and then raising it for the rest of her life.  Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.  It cannot be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it. Only within a set time frame during which it has not become a person.   Premarital sex: Sex that occurs before marriage.  views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.  Generally I think of premarital sex as occurring within a relationship. If you're talking about casual, random sex, then your argument may hold some weight. But in the context of a relationship, there is a lot more at stake than personal pleasure via sex.   Homosexuality: Sexual desire for those of the same sex.  An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.   Wait....whaT? Where exactly are you getting this?   Pornography: Sexual media that satisfies urges of those who cannot get laid as often as they'd like.  The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.  Hustler is viewed as an object for personal pleasure to be discarded. Not the people themselves.   Soft porn: Sexy people doing sexy things  Ted Bundy: Serial killer  Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .   Turned to violent sexuality (more often detective books portraying sexual violence than pornography) after an inability to relate to humanity.   I'm skipping around on your other arguments because I'm not in the mood for an essay, so bear with me.   Find me the "so many" homosexuals who can walk away from the lifestyle and never go back and I'll find you a group of people who have lied to themselves to make society happy.   Laws should be based on the good of society, not on your morals.   About sex ed, you're naive if you think we can leave it to the hands of the parents. You may be a responsible parent who plans to teach your children about sex, but many are not. We owe a responsibility to every child to give them the tools necessary to make the right choices when the time comes. Whether that's abstention or contraception, only they can make that choice.   Alas, I think I'm a little spent on this topic. I've had this in my argument activity for weeks but I've been reluctant to write back because it's gone all over the place. If you want to debate any of the non-abortion arguments we've been discussing, let's create a new debate, because this long argument full of fifty mini-arguments is just confusing.

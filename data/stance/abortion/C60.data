Having an abortion is just pure selfishness, it is is as simple as that. Women make a choice themselves to have sex, and then play god and decide if the child can live or die, making such invalid comments as "its my body its my choice" not realizing that it is not just about them anymore.  You cannot say that a fetus is not human, or not living. Everything about the fetus was made from living organism, and blood and cells ect ect, it took two LIVING breathing humans to make this child. Is a plant not alive simply because it cannot speak? is a microscopic plankton not alive simply because you cannot see it with the naked eye? no. It is as alive as you are.   There is no reason for abortion when there are so many people out there who cannot have children themselves. If a women does not care enough for this child, that she wishes to abort it, then it cannot be hard for her to carry this child and give it to somebody who would love it.  If somebody tried to decide for you, whether you could live or die, you would be angry, that is not a choice they are allowed to make, and it should never be a choice for woman.  Every child deserves a voice, every child deserves to live. Women simply need to wake up and take action for their mistakes. Abortion is murder.

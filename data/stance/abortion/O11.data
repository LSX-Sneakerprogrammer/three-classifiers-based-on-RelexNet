I thought about it some more. I think even tho both male and female are responsible for the pregnancy, the female is more responsible. Why? She allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg.   If you only 'blame' the man when he rapes the woman, shouldn't you conversely only blame the woman if she rapes the man? In consensual sex, both partners are equally involved in the decision to give the sperm and the egg the opportunity to meet. You say "she allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg" like it came knocking on the door of her egg and she decided to let it in.  What do you feel is gained from assigning blame to anybody?   I don't believe in accidental pregnancies. You might say, what if a condom breaks? That is why on the box it says 99 percent safe.     ac·ci·den·tal   1. happening by chance or accident; not planned; unexpected: an accidental meeting.  2. nonessential; incidental; subsidiary: accidental benefits.  3. a nonessential or subsidiary circumstance, characteristic, or feature.  I would think a review of the definition would be enough to show that yes, accidental pregnancies exist, whether or not you believe in them. When you engage in an activity, you are not automatically consenting to allow the potential negative consequences of that activity to run their course without interference.   For example, every time you get in a car, you realize there is a possibility you will get in a car accident. This does not mean you are consenting to being injured without trying to reverse or mitigate your injuries. You are engaging in activity, recognizing the risks and doing your best to prevent them while still intending to undo any damage that may occur. Removing any sentimentality from the issue of abortion, it is no different. Pregnancy is an occasional consequence of sex and abortion is a way of dealing with that consequence.

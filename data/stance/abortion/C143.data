First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion.   If you are personally pro-life but politically pro-choice, then I don't really have anything to dispute with you. I would still think your personal opinions were kind of callous and vindictive, but I respect someone with the ability to have an opinion and not try to get it passed into legislature.   But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'.    I know exactly what you are trying to say. That teenagers should be punished with pregnancy, childbirth, and according to you, childrearing, if they dare to have sex.   Note: I am not advocating that all teenagers get abortions. I also think that all possibilities should be considered. If they feel like they can raise a child, or bear the pregnancy and give it up for adoption, fine. If they feel like they cannot, also fine.    How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned?   Whenever the pregnant person in question wants one. Unlike you, I realize it is not my place to be to condone or condemn the situations in which some people choose to get an abortion.   Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners?   That is not how transmission works. Someone who contracts an STD could have been completely honest about their past, and indeed have only had one sexual partner. It takes only one partner being dishonest or just ignorant about their past to spread an STD.   If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.    Your first two sentences don't make any sense to me. You will have to rephrase. I will also rephrase this point as it seems you misunderstood me as well.  Pregnancy and STDs are both sometimes consequences of sex. Not necessarily irresponsible or promiscuous sex, just sex. This is especially true for pregnancy.  Abortion is a way of dealing with a pregnancy. Carrying it to term is also a way of dealing with a pregnancy. You advocate the latter option, because apparently the former option is 'the easy way out' and you think people (teenagers specifically?) should have to ride out the course of the consequence.  Treatment is a way of dealing with and STD. So is leaving it untreated. By the same principles on which you find abortion unacceptable (not the human rights issue, which is I am not considering in this comparison, but the argument that the only way to correctly deal with the consequences of sex is to not get an abortion) then you should also advocate that people not seek treatment for STDs. Doing so would be the easy way out, after all.   I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance.   You think abortion is acceptable only some of the time. In cases where the mother is not in danger, but does not want the fetus, do you think she should be made to keep it? If so, this is reducing her to the rank of a subcitizen whose body is mercy to the actions others find acceptable or unacceptable.  As I said before, if you personally think she should keep the baby but do not advocate making abortion illegal in any situation, then I do not actually have anything to dispute.    And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for "incubating a fetus she doesn't want" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place have gotten pregnant in the first place would she?   Is this a misstatement or do you actually think that fertilization occurs only with the express permission of the mother?   Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.   I don't think any particular pregnancy should be definitely aborted either. That is not the point I am arguing at all.

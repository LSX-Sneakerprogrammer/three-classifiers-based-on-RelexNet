No the question is what do you not understand. You are the one saying that an undeveloped human hasn't the rights of a developed human an yet we were all once "undeveloped" so we technically have no rights since we were undeveloped. So you would not care if your parents decided that oh we want an abortion because it is undeveloped so it does not have the rights that we developed humans do.     Are you developed or undeveloped (an embryo or foetus)?  This is a binary question. You are either one or the other.  If you are a foetus (you aren't, right?), then you have no human rights.  If you are post-birth, aka a developed human, you have human rights. The rights or lack thereof of one of these categories doesn't affect the other. Rights are granted upon birth.

HEAR! HEAR!  I'd add that it is not the "defining moral issue of the day" since it's only like 15% of the population making tons of noise about it, the same people who always make a bunch of noise about settled issues, but for some reason every rep listens to that 15%.  But why make it more confusing than it has to be? Good answer.

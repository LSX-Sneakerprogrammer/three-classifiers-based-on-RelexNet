Take biology class early abortions you are removing a small fetus that lacks a brain but has a underdeveloped nervous systems which is why they move when abortion apparatus is inserted. Much like how an insect will move after death. Saying that, late term abortions are appalling a fully developed baby is being murdered, developed brain, developed nervous system and developed lil hands.

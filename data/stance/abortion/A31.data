is Bush # 43 ancient history?  during his eight years, he had a Republican controlled Congress that was NOT in a lame duck status  even when it was so-called lame duck, are yah telling me that the Republicans would have voted against Bush administration abortion restrictions ?  they had the 50+% Congressinal majority and could have forced a Senate filibuster debate  but i suspect that the Republican leadership primarily give the anti-abortionist lip service

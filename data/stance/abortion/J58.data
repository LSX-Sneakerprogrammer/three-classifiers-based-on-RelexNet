I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics   Fair enough. Really though I have this inclination to point out that what we call facts rest on subjective judgment, so I threw the word around loosely trying to illustrate that.    What makes an option better than abortion?   How about for starters it's likelihood to promote a culture of responsibility as opposed to the avoidance thereof.   Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   A hospital, A government, A trusted consultant.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   By noticing that accidental pregnancy invariably begins with a lack of consideration for, and discarding of smarter options. In general, abortions are the gross finale of a series of poorly considering ones sexual options. Sexual arousal, intense enjoyment, and climax can be achieved just fine while opting to avoid coitus and instead participating in mutual masturbation, oral sex, toys and other diversions. But that requires too much effort, heck demanding the use of a condom is for plenty of people, too much to ask. We'd have such a better situation if people would only have sex (I'm referring to the kind pregnancy results from) with partners they have seriously vetted as being worthy as partners in procreation. If cheap thrills weren't an acceptable substitute for genuine intimacy we'd be on to something. Abortion would be no where near as common. End of digressive rant.   You used it once in one way, and once in another way.   I went back and reread my posts. I don't notice myself doing what you claim. I try to be clear, and lay myself open to scrutiny. If you don't think it would be nit picking, by all means help me understand my misuse of a term.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options.   Well look there...we disagree...maybe....how about not all of them but a great deal of them then?   What are you using to support this claim?   I hope you find my rant above relevant and it gives you something to thoughtfully consider/refute.   Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Well it's just my opinion, but the best way for a pregnancy to conclude is with the birth of a healthy baby.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.  If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact   Since I can't draw a clear distinction between physical and mental health (And I don't suspect you can either), I'll take that as a carefully worded concession. :)   Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    No more so than using guilt or shame to influence a parent to take better responsibility for their child(ren). My thoughts tend toward how people are pressured  into  abortions, even when they don't want them, with statements like "it will ruin your life" etc.. Abortion is propagandized as a way to insure scholastic, professional or financial success, and it's made to seem like getting pregnant is necessarily a detriment to those aspirations. In general do you think more pressure is exerted to promote abortions or to discourage them?   There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.   - No doubt - It's a sign of the deepest sort of poverty to make a decision to abandon responsibility for our own species while they're in the earliest stages of development. Even miscarriages are due to poverty.   I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not.   Having serious doubts about our ability to handle parenting alone is normal and healthy. But if it's wrong to use shame to get people to take responsibility for their actions, it's even more wrong to use it to encourage them to abandon them. Besides shame is a great motivator, and no one can  make  someone feel shame without their permission right?   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.   Thanks for sharing your subjective opinion. :)   A negative impact on mental health is rare.   How did you learn that?   It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   Who is pressuring women to get an abortion when they don't want it?

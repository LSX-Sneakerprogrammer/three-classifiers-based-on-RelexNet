I'm asking you why it's wrong to destroy potential life.  You're saying it's wrong to destroy potential life because it will become life.  In other words, it's wrong to destroy potential life because it's potential life.  This is circular reasoning.  Embryos don't have a say in the matter because they are not yet humans. If I had been aborted as an embryo I would not have given one rat's ass, because I would have been incapable of doing so. No harm, no foul. The world keeps spinning. What's the big deal?

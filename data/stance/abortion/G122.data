Maybe you should check the statistics to show how many women are having repeat abortions. Do you think that the unborn should pay for the mistakes of it's mother? Most women according to statistics are having repeat abortions. I was born out of child pregnancy. My mother regardless of being challenged with poverty and unpreparedness brought me up. Today i am a student in pre law with a G.P.A of 4.0 and straight A student. Do you think that bringing me up made her a responsible woman or abortion?  Furthermore, for every mistake there is a punishment. Didn't parents punished you for a mistake, don't the laws punish you for a mistake, don't your job punish you for a mistake?Why? Before consensual unprotected sex, every woman have a choice to protect themselves and is fully aware of the consequences of their actions. So why should they claim they are unprepared after learning they are pregnant?

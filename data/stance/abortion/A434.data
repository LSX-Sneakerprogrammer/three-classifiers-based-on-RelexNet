You're not killing a KID. I must have said this a billion times. But you're still stuck on that, so it's a shame.  On the subject of why Death is preferable to Life: Because Death comes to us all. And Death is as much a part of Life as Light and Dark, or Good and Evil. Death can't be avoided.   What you're talking about is a POSSIBLE contribution to society on earth if the fetus be allowed to mature into a person. But we've already argued this point of POSSIBILITY to death (excuse the pun): a fetus Could turn out to be worse than Hitler or the Devil itself... but you love talking about possibilities don't you? You have a fixation on things that aren't real. Please read a fantasy novel, don't ban abortion.

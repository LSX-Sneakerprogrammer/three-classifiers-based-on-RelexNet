It's unfortunate millions of women aren't raped? ... interesting.  At any rate, I don't care if it's .000001%. It's none of your business how someone else got pregnant and they don't need you all up in their vagina telling them what to do because  you  don't want to have an abortion.   Until people start ripping fetuses out of your belly against your will, you don't have a right to force them to carry around what at that stage amounts to a tumor, against their will.

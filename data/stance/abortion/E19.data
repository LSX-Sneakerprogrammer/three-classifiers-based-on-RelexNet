If you do not wish to bear a child for 9 months and give birth to it and be responsible for it, then you should have every right to terminate the pregnancy.  It's a personal, ethical judgement as to whether you believe that what is inside you is a "human being" or not, or whether or not you value "potential" human beings.  This is a decision that should not be made FOR other people, but one they should get to keep.  Stop trying to take away people's freedom of choice, while simultaneously waving a flag and screaming freedom. Sometimes freedom is ugly and not what you want to see... so deal with it.

I made 2 very clear points for you to argue, but again you've gone and taken the scenic route all over the countryside, what's more, you've actually missed the 2 sights you were supposed to visit, here I'll number for you so you won't miss them:  1 - Abortions have good reasons to exist, that's why they exist.  2 - We can remove fetuses if we want and we don't need any excuses. It's not the same as killing people. We're not in shortage of fetuses in the world.   Now, focus! Don't go past "Go" nor collect $200 dollars (referencing the family game Monopoly) until you've talked about these 2 points. Then if you want to make another point, do so in a different post.

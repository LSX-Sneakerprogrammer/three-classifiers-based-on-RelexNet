Right now you are the one who cannot comprehend this.   As of right now abortion is legal. Other people though do not agree (like me) that abortion SHOULD be legal. Murder is an unlawful killing. I am saying it is people opinions. They MAY BELIEVE abortion is okay and some MAY NOT it is their OPINION.

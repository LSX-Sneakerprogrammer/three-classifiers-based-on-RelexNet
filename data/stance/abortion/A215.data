Why do we need an excuse to get rid of a fetus if we don't want it? It's our fetus, not yours, we can get rid of this one and then we can make another one! Women have children after abortions all the time, it's when they're ready to be mothers!  It's not a person before it can survive outside the womb, so if you think it is a person good for you! Don't force us to see your point of view as we don't force you to see ours.

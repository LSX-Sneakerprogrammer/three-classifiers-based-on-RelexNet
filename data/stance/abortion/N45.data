1. Newborns are not independent of their natural host. Left alone they will die of thirst. Just as people who are comatose can again become independent with time, a fetus can become independent if it is given the time to mature into a child and then an adult.  2. Again there are people with brain damage who will never be able to do these things, given any amount of time. However most fetuses will be able to if given time (they grow into children and then adults). You're looking at a fetus as a separate entity from a human, but it is just the beginning growth stage of a human.  3. A fetus can do these things once it grows to be a child. Just as a child can do more things once it becomes an adult.  4. If this were the case, you'd be dead in a few hours. Your body is constantly reproducing cells to replace dying ones. Sexual reproduction is a very tiny, tiny percentage of the reproduction the human body is engaged in.  5. I have a friend who is asexual due to a birth defect where her womb never developed. I don't think this in any way excludes her from being a human. A child cannot sexually reproduce because their organs have not come to maturity yet. A fetus cannot sexually reproduce because it has not begun developing sexual organs yet (but it has the DNA plans to and is working on it). Newborns certainly don't have all the biological features of an adult - how does this affect their humanity?  6.1 - Nay. It is not the baby's fault that the mother was raped, so she has no right to harm it.  6.2 - Nay. This is unfortunate, but if it is not life-or-death, how is there any justification in killing the baby?  6.3 - Nay. Again this is unfortunate, but how can we presume to know if the baby wants to live or not? If this were acceptable, the retarded, disfigured, and elderly people could be killed along the same line of reasoning.  6.4 - Nothing, read my response to this:  http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                        Would_You_Kill_1_person_to_Save_the_ lives_of_2_others_assuming_everything_i s_equal#arg224482

Your entire argument fails if we apply the same standard to any accident.   It is not an accident. It is the sole purpose of sex naturally. You continually present the child as an accident. This means you have a knowledge of biology equivalent to that of a 4th grader in middle America. Or. You are knowingly stating lies to further an unfounded point out of lack of an actual argument. The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring. By making it a pleasure activity, you corrupt its true purpose. Now this is fine as long as one is prepared for that stupid, implausible. far-fetched, unlikely, ludicrous scenario where... what is actually supposed to happen happens. Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   So how would you define a "scientific definition"?   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   And none of which are usually fatal.   Which is exactly the same position I am arguing for   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases. I am on the side of life. If death is the result in either case, why put the parents through unneeded trauma? And my argument of choice falls apart in cases of rape, thus, it is my only other exception.   That was not my point.   An immature brain is not a defective one.   What I said was that I will not stop any mother and/or father from deciding to abort their unborn if they do so within the first trimester because the brain of the fetus hasn't even been formed yet.   Hence my point that it all distills down to a meaningless argument.

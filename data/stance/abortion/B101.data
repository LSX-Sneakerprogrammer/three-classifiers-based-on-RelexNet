And what is a negative circumstance that would meet your appoval?   Is it your business why a woman aborts? My neice was born at 23 weeks.....and babies have lived a few weeks earlier than that. Do you think you could pinpoint the EXACT point in the pregnancy when the fetus is work saving? I would think since abortion kills, that you would want to be right on the money here. Or doesn't it make any difference?  So what is your stance on abortion?

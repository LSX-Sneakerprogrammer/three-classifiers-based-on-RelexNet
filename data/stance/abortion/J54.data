If you mean disgusting as in 'gross to watch,' then we're in agreement, but that doesn't turn an opinion into a fact.    It's just a tad more deep seated than an opinion. Disgust can be evoked without visual stimulus or having formed anything like an opinion. For example with extremely foul odors. An odor that is  in fact  disgusting to some, others may find that they can tolerate. The fact that some people build a tolerance and can endure without experiencing disgust doesn't make it any less factual that the smell is disgusting.   More than the thoughts of people actually faced with getting abortions?   If someone feels like they are "faced with getting an abortion" when they really aren't, perhaps thoughts like those I express will be considered more weighty than those expressed by people like you who as I see it are advocates of abortion as a form of birth control.   If by necessary, you mean something that logically follows and literally cannot be other way, then even your 'necessary' abortions are not necessary.   True, there are always other options, though they may not be immediately perceivable. I don't use the word necessary in such a manner as to retard recognition of the possibility of better options. Obviously earlier on some things were thought to be necessary that were later proven not to be.   After all, people can always 'choose' to let themselves die slow, painful deaths.   No they can't, not always. :)  Anything we deem to be necessary is representative of a decision we've already made...it's a specific conclusion we've come to in that other possible courses of events are excluded from consideration.   You already have. Unless you did actually mean necessary in the logical sense, you've decided 'necessary' means 'necessary to prevent the mother from suffering death or serious injury.'   The only reason abortions are performed is that we don't realize better alternatives. It's not that the alternatives don't exist, it's that they are not sought out with enough diligence. If you want to use logic so strict that it renders the use of the term "necessary" pointless, I'll have to agree that no medical procedures are necessary. You could however submit to common sense and realize I was referring to a determination of necessity made by a licensed medical professional.   Things that would make doctors hacks according to you:  Correcting birth defects such as extra fingers, tails, or deviated septa  Cosmetic reconstructive surgery for accident victims  All exploratory surgeries   Sorry, I left out "improving". I'm sure you wouldn't dispute that those type of surgeries have health benefits. I think you're straining at gnats here.   Things that wouldn't:  Abortion (unless you can show me that pregnancy does not reduce the mother's health from its pre-pregnancy level, thus making abortion a procedure that restores health)   There are countless factors that come into play when considering the overall health of a person, and I may not be able to convince you, but there are plenty of occasions where pregnancy and childbirth result in a stronger more healthy woman. If the burden of proof was on you, I suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre-pregnancy level.

Actually, you can contract an STD not having sex outside of marriage.   Or, to avoid the double negative, having sex strictly with your spouse. It takes TWO people to make sex. So,  you  not having sex outside of marriage doesn't necessitate that he/she will as well.   It would require both parties abstain to attain the "high sexual standards" you propose setting. What are our current sexual standards by comparison?   As far as abortion goes, there are clearly differing opinions on when life begins. As such, let doctors inform the law on when defining characteristics appear, and let women make the choice on moral judgement.

The number of abortions are relatively small   Sorry, I just wanted to clarify. (I'm very pro-choice).  You say this like it's a positive thing that the number of abortions had is relatively small. You said prior to that  A fetus is NOT a human, just a massï»¿ of tissue   Why would you want  less  abortions if the doctor is simply aborting tissue?

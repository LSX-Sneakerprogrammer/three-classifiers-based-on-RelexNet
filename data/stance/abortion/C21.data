I do not believe in abortion. You are killing a living breathing human being. I understand why certain people might want to get an abortion, i.e they were raped or can't afford to take care of it, but if that's the case then just give the child to someone else.     This is a human being:   http://dartmed.dartmouth.edu/spring08/ images/amazing_human_being_01.jpg    This is a foetus:   http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/06/ foetusREX010606_228x188.jpg    It has no mind. It has no awareness. It is a burden to someone else. This is why abortion exists.

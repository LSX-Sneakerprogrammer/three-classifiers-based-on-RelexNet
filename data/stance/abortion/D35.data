The frightening thing about the abortion debate in this country is that not enough attention is brought to the fact that white men often have the strongest opinion on the matter.  While I am in NO way religious, I understand that some people are religious, and that abortion goes against their beliefs. Why is it, then, that these people do not respect my views (or lack thereof) and are ffighting (sometimes violently) to make abortion illegal.  Leave it up to the WOMEN who should have teh right to chose, on a completely individual basis.

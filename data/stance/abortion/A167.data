"You all keep telling us that it's murder!"   Murder is not the word that I would use.  I see an abortion as an unnecessary decision, one which could have been prevented but instead has been inconsiderately acted upon.   Instead of hitting the problem on the head, we are circling the issue. By this I refer to the fact that an unwanted pregnancy is the source of the problem, yet we do nothing to stop this issue; instead, we are nailing the leaf and not the stem by aborting the unwanted child. So, while unwanted pregnancies climb, so do the rate of abortion.  Were we to actually decide that we should perhaps try to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies, we would finally be making a difference. We just need to make certain that education finds a way to influence the minds of all teens and couples, so that an unwanted pregnancy becomes a thing of the past, as will abortion. Then we simply push abortion to the side, as we will have finally killed a major weed in the garden of life.  In another argument, you stated that we should instead outlaw unprotected sex, which is the  biggest amount of BS that I have heard in this debate!  Think about it: suddenly we are no longer able to freely create as we please, pro-creation becomes a thing of the past, and the rate of childbirth drops in the high thousands. And as for 'fining' unprotected sex or using 'jail-time' as a punishment; that is  just plain stupid . The Government  can  have a say in education, but they  cannot  examine each and every couple for a condom each and every time that they have sex. It would be a full time job with prostitutes.  So, hopefully I've cleared up a few things, and hopefully you finally understand where I am coming from.

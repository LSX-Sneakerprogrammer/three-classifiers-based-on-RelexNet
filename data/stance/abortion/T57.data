It's easy to manage that by introducing a time delay so the law will take effect 24 months from its introduction. This is done all the times to allow people and the industry to prepare and adjust to any new laws.   .  24 months should allow 12 months for a government campaign to make the public aware of the new law before they decide to engage in sexual activities that may result in a pregnancy. After that you still have a 3-month buffer if you're not yet aware of the new law, the remaining 9 months is so that people who became pregnant during this campaign period is not disadvantaged if they're still not yet aware of the new law. All this can be left to the trusty government bureaucratic systems to hash out, that's their job, and they're good at it :)

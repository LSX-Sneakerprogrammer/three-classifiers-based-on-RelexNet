I can't admit that of course because I am pro-life.   Who is the authority on what pro-lifers may and may not admit?   In what circumstances do you consider abortion if any murder?   If it's murder it's murder, if it's abortion it's not murder. Situations where a life is ended for no good medical reason shouldn't be called abortions.   Or do you just think all cases of abortion are ok?   I don't think it's OK to commit murder and call it abortion.   What do you mean medical necessity?   Necessary as determined in the confidential Doctor Patient relationship.   Do you mean the less than 1% of the cases when abortion is perform to save the mothers life?   Don't get me wrong, I think it's disgusting, how often murdering a perfectly viable and healthy fetus passes for a legitimate medical procedure.   If there is nothing wrong with abortion....why don't people talk about it like its just any other kind of surgery?   Because a very young human dies, and people don't want to think about that. They want to put it out of their minds.   It is the most common surgery performed in America today   That gives me the shivers to think about.   IS THERE SOMETHING MORALLY WRONG WITH ABORTION?   No.

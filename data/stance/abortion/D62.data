Yes, abortion should be legal. First off, you'll never stop abortions, legal or not. If abortions are not legal, women and young girls will be having abortions in places such as motel rooms, back street alleys, etc., which are very unsanitary and dangerous. Also does anyone really think that the rich won't have abortions if they are made illegal? Of course they will, they'll pay top dollar to have an abortion. Lastly, it is really nobody's business what the female decides except her and her family. Pus you don't know the circumstances. Women have the right to choose, period.

It is very difficult question to answer to. Well, the argument of the "agaist" list is the inhumanity. I mean, the unborn children are not guilty. They have no choices, but they have rights to live. It's only the people's that made that child fault. Why has the abortion become so common and easy to do? They don't think that it's real crime, real murder. It's just like the games for them, the mistakes of youth.  But sometimes extreme circumstances happen. For example rape. Or the danger of "future" mother's life.  Well I'm saying that abortion should be legal but only for certain, really serious conditions. Otherwise the legal abortion can be the reason of indiscriminate sex and youth's irresponsibility.

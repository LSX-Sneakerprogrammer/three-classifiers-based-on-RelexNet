"Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human "spirit" or "soul" inside of it (for those who are religious)."  This is the heart of the anti-abortion argument, the idea that what makes a human being "human" is his or her soul, and that that soul is present from the moment of conception on. It matters not that at the moment of conception the zygote has less cells then you have fingers on one hand, it is the moral equivalent of a human being because it has a soul.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing the idea. It is a religious idea and in this, a country with religious freedom, you are free to believe that idea and to live your life in accordance with that and other religious beliefs.   But you should realize that there are many people who do not share your religious beliefs and we also live in a country with religious freedom. Why is it that you would deny us the right to live our lives according to our religious beliefs when we would fight to protect your right to do the same?

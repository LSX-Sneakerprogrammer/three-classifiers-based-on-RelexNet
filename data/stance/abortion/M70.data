also i suppose sapience could be made a metaphor to puberty. it is impossible to be considered a man before puberty, during puberty you are becoming a man or rather more accurately you are some mixture of man and boy, and after it you are a man which all men can admittedly act boyishly and in some moments not measure up to the standards of maturity which may be imposed on us by the expectation of our mates [we don't grow up, our toys just get bigger! :) ]. Like wise it could be postulated that it is impossible to be considered a person before your conception, that you are becoming a person well in the womb or rather you are some mixture of a person and non person and that after birth you will have moments in which you fail to meet the criteria of personhood. so what does this entail?

I know this wasn't aimed at me but you never respond to my arguments, it's so frustrating! I give you legitimate sources and facts and instead of accepting them you just use the same lies to argue with another person!   no child at birth could survive without intervention   Like I said before anyone who believes this is stupid. How long have humans existed? It's only in the last 100 years that medicine has been greatly involved in child birth. Of course babies survive without medical intervention. It's natural to not have someone constantly shoving there fingers in you to check dilation. It's natural to give birth unaided. More and more woman now, even in developed countries are choosing not to have a child in hospital or with medical assistance. Instead they opt to give birth at home naturally and without medical intervention. People in poor countries just give birth in their bed and get on with it!    and want them dead.   I see you haven't moved on from blaming people for death. How is he responsible for all the woman in the world having an abortion. He didn't choose for them to abort they choose themselves. But at least he didn't get dubbed Hitler like you did for me.  Now would you mind responding to my many posts? I've given you the scientific facts about when a fetus can feel pain and when it's brain is active and how that stands with my views on abortion. Why won't you respond to science?

Indeed, lets start by executing abortionists.  Their dying screams...like music to my ears ;)   Odd how violent you are, and the lack of respect you have for human life. I may kill foetuses but I don't pretend to hold all life as sacred, and I rationally defend my thoughts. You scream insincere sanctimony, claiming to have a moral high ground while approving a deed that is the very definition of murder.

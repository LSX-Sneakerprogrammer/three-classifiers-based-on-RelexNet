ok and like i saidd, every mothere should have her own desicon on whether or not they want to go through a pregancy. For instance what if it wasnt a accident to have the child and the mother found out that her soon to be baby was special ed. so she desided to get an abortion. I know she's killin a life and i do think thats wrong, but in the same way she might want to protect that unborn from going through pain and trials in the future... Let me remind you that the title of this argument " Abortion should be Banned". Thats a straight forward yes or no question and since there are " what if's" (what if it is rape, what if it's an aciddent , ect.) in this situation the conclusion is that Abortions should'nt be banned.

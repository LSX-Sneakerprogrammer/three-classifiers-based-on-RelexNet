Some evidence please?  Otherwise LOL   It is an obvious extrapolation from known facts.  Taxis does not require a mind, as observed in simple animals like fruit flies. Brains themselves are complicated entities, which in Humans mature at around 18 to 23 years. Infant brains are still critically forming, hence why they are so dependent upon us and only start learning language after at least the first year and motor function is under critical development.  Why would you assume that an infant has a fully aware mind at birth, much less the weeks before birth all the way down to the first twelve weeks of pregnancy?

Early-term abortions should undoubtedly be legal.  I have one question for all of those who claim that abortion should be illegal because it is taking a life: If abortion becomes illegal, and a woman has an illegal abortion, what should her punishment be? Technically what she has done is murder; thus, under current laws, capital punishment would be a common solution. So, does a woman who has an abortion deserve the death penalty?

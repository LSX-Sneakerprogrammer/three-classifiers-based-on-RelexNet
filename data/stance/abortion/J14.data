Most abortions happen after the heart starts beating.   And so?   However barbaric…abortion should be celebrated and should be allowed…however horrendous it is.   Even if it may seem horrendous, it does not necessarily imply that it ought not to be allowed or done. All you have done here is simply appeal to emotion and given no logical arguments for your position.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions.   Really? Let's think about it then. If a mother is definitely going to die very slowly and painfully if the baby is not aborted, is it more immoral to abort the baby or allow the mother to die a slow and agonising death?  Let me raise another scenario. What if a minor was impregnated by a violent rape and the rapist does not take responsibility for the child? Is it more immoral to leave a defenceless and helpless minor to care for a baby, a constant psychological reminder of rape, or for her to abort? I'm not talking about who you would have more sympathy for, but merely on what moral grounds do you have to say abortion is immoral.  By logic, you yourself have no good reason to be opposed to abortion.

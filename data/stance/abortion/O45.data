Of course, everyone has right to choose, because it is independent country.In my point of view, abortion must be banned.    Abortion is like a murder as it is the act of taking human life. I don't think that aborting is the easiest thing, what u can do, because it cause many problems with health. For example, the woman did abortion and some years later, when she gets marriage. She can not get pregnant, because of that.   As u know, there is no crime without punishment, because nobody permitted to harm or take the life of another person( but it is not stranger, it is your own child).I think, you should not be such a cold, especially to a child, which you wear under your heart.

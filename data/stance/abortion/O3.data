Birth control is not 100 percent effective; one of my coworkers was on birth control and conceived. Now she is a proud mother.   Conceiving while on birth control isn't always due to incorrect application or use of the birth control, sometimes a person just falls into that .01 percent where the birth control failed to do what it was meant to. In that sense, considering a person taking it who didn't intend on having a baby and the birth control failed, I would support her if she decided to have an abortion.  And who's to say those who are allergic to certain types of birth control aren't already considering the possibility of conceiving? Would thinking "of the consequences before... sex" justify a personâ€™s decision if they conceived and wanted an abortion? If not then why even bring that up?

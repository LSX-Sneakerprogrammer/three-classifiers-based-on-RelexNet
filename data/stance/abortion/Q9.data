No, we have a mind   Define mind? If by mind you mean sentience, fetuses are sentient after 12 weeks.   No, it's less dangerous to abort than give birth, wth^^   Again, in the same way that mass genocide reduces the number of traffic accidents.   Those are not morals, morals are more of opinions, these are really not opinions   I don't understand your argument.   A fetus is like a parasite, should a mother have no choice?   She had a choice. She CHOSE to have sex, knowing full well the possible ramifications of such an action.    Yes, it could cause a lot of crime, which the state doesn't want, and it would be more dangerous   Of course criminalizing an act will increase the criminal offenses of that act. But that is not an argument in and of itself.

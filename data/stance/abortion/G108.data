In a debate either you are for or against. Ask anyone that and they will tell you.   Just asked my brother. Nope, one can be neither for nor against abortion. It's called CHOICE. It's not a matter of "abortion is good/bad!" abortion is just an act. "Good" and "bad" are labels imposed by you.   Are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion.   I'm 90% sure you're a troll now. Pro choice =/= pro abortion. Say it with my now; Pro choice =/= pro abortion. Pro choice is about individuals choosing to either get an abortion or not based on their own unique situation.    Again you don't care. That to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge.   Man, you're really judgmental, aren't you. ;)  I don't particularly care if you find me selfish and ignorant, you have yet to give a relevant reason as to why abortion should be illegal. Not once in all your barely comprehend able posts have you done this.   Your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence.   Actually, this is YOUR debate, or did you mean argument? ;)  There is no inconsistent information in my argument because I haven't posted any "information", I've only been debunking you, so now you're a liar. And a bad one at that, do you think I don't comprehend my own posts or something? XD   Please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you, you are a person of science.   I never even said anything remotely like that... -_-    You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts.   No, opinions should be built on RELEVANT facts. For example; I say you have made the logical fallacy known as "appeal to emotion" this is a fact. You say "Woma have died from abortions, therefore abortion should be wrong" This is also a fact, it just isn't a relevant one. And if your argument is based on fallacies and irrelevant facts &gt;&gt;YOU ARE WRONG&lt;&lt;   Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy.   ... Do you think I care? Really? Let them read it. I'll debate them too if they carry your idiocy with them.   I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.   And are they all "pro-life" too? If so, I've nothing to worry about. ;)   You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance.    You're projecting again ;)   You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey.   Oh, I've thought about what you're trying to convey; I've just decided it's wrong relative to the topic is all, ;)   When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.   Again, I'm not against facts. I'm against your stupidity. I'm against the conclusions you've derived from these facts. Stop trying to pass the blame onto the facts, they can't change, but you sure as hell can.   And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.   ... And yet you have. Is your dunce cap on too tight or something?   There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute.   Man, it takes a lot of repetition for you to learn, doesn't it? I never said you can't use these things, hell you may even win a debate with them if you're talking to someone even dumber than you (insert your own "country full of idiots for you to talk to" joke)... but when you're talking to someone intelligent enough to recognize a logical fallacy (e.g. Myself... and everyone else on this site) you're bound to get called out on it.  And, if you're entire argument is based on a fallacy, then you're wrong. Thus, you lose.   And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense. You need people to explain everything to you. And furthermore, this is not a debate this is selfishness.   Selfishness? THIS IS SSSSSSSSSayyad99's attempt at hurting my feelings? I have a hard time taking offense to insults written by someone with a third grade writing level. =/

You do speeches? Who actually corrects your grammar for you? I can't believe I have the patience to wade through the grammatically incorrect sentences and illogical structures of your arguments. Half the time I'm not even sure you're on point, I mean I don't even know what you're arguing for any more. Are you against a ban on abortion or not? It's a clear topic. You may have all the hearts to be a great debater, but that's all you've got at the moment.  If you believe that this topic demands the "thoughts" and "feelings" of people, not on statistics and logics, how then will you convince legislators to make laws for your cause? They only work on facts, logics, numbers.   "Rape is illegal, and yet it still happens" is this an argument Against or For a ban on abortion?   I DID consider your educational example, and I also gave it a thought, but don't ask me to give it a second thought. I already told you it's not an original idea to go around doing talks. It's been done since people know how to talk. It's been done to death!   If you're got a "right plan" to make abortions "no longer be necessary", then let's hear it, but you'll need to be more imaginative then doing talks.  Good luck with that. I hope you win many awards :) But if you're fighting for a ban on abortion, don't expect us to be your friend, least of all, me.

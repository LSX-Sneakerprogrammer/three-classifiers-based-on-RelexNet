Abortion should not be legal. It is the taking of a human life however you try to spin it. Everything happens for a reason; the baby should not suffer because of the mistakes of the parents. Most abortions that take place in America are cases of convenience, which is clearly wrong! I do understand that cases of rape or medical necessity are more difficult and cannot be black and white. I have compassion for these mothers and feel for their situations. Adoption is a great alternative!

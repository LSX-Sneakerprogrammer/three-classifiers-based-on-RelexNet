Well the fetus feeds through it's mother. An egg is not a developing human being neither does it possess life. The fetus cannot be hugged i agree but why then when you go to a doctor they normally detect the heartbeat of the unborn to check whether it is alive or not. Does the heartbeat not indicates the presence of life? Does the fetus not have a separate DNA and blood type? Does the fetus not have a growing human body?

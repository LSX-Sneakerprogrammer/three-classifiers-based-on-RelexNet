Let's assume that we don't know when life begins or at what point those cells in the mothers womb become human. And let's say we can't answer the question, what is it. If we take all the arguments for abortion and weigh all the objections then I have only one question. If we don't know the right or wrong answer to the question of abortion.  Why not err on the side of life?   If we don't know, and this debate demonstrates that, then why not use caution and restraint? It's seems to me that if this issue of abortion is "debatable" then it would be unwise to throw open the gates of permission.   What if we are wrong and it turns out that we have actually snuffed out the life of over 45 million children? I think the guilt of that would have a more profound affect on our nation than thousands of women who die from back ally abortions. See, in abortion we as a nation are complicate in the act because we as a nation sanctioned it. In the back ally abortion we have no guilt because the parties acted contrary to our law. If you think nations don't have guilt, ask a German about the Holocaust. The don't like to talk about it for obvious reasons.

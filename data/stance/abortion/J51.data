Abortion is a disgusting thing. That's a fact.   No, it isn't. That is an opinion.    I see nothing wrong with working to reduce public acceptance of abortion as a form of birth control.   A little public shaming never hurt anyone, right?  I know we've been over this before and the conversation got to be too much for me to keep straight as much as it was interesting, so I'll try to keep this focused. You speak as if your definition of the 'unnecessary' is the one that matters. I'm sure you understand that many people actually getting abortions consider it absolutely necessary...and without understanding their circumstances, you're advocating public hostility towards their choice. What qualifies you to decide what is necessary and unnecessary for strangers, and what social punishment they should receive if they don't obey your standards?

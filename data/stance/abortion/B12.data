No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......it’s NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said it’s unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, “It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.”  Am I calling names? Didn’t you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crass…sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blame……and blame you do, for what is a woman’s issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortions….because I know what it’s like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess what………..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted on……‘You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.”  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robbery….and they are caught….does the police just say….ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didn’t show up, the nurse refuse to do it…the baby might have a chance.   You said, “ Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.”  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isn’t that what it’s all about, you said so yourself didn’t you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,“ Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.”  I said, if a woman and man are married……he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she can’t hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificate…and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, “What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay.”  Well you are wrong again….   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ James_Elgin_Gill    128 days early… or 21 weeks 5 days early  Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issue….personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  “If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?"  You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????  Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?

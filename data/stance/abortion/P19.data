If a 12 year old girl is raped and gets pregnant, do you really want that girl who isn't even a teenager yet to give birth? It is completely the girls choice. You can't tell a girl whether she should   have a child or not. You might say that there is always another adult who could adopt the child, but what about the act of giving birth? The biological mother could die during the process. If abortion isn't legal, then we need free birth control. But it would be best with both because then the biological mother gets a choice.

How so?   The mere fact that they were using contraceptives (correctly, of course) means that they were being responsible because their intention was not to have a baby and to avoid the choice of an abortion in the first place. If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault! You can't accuse them of being irresponsible if the contraceptive fails in this manner. That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were "irresponsible".   semantics...   Hey, you were the one who wanted to play this game ;)   And I can give many that are not.   Therefore, you are committing the genetic fallacy. Because whether or not the definition comes from the OED has no bearing on whether the definition is true or not. I haven't seen you challenge the definitions I have quoted, so I'll assume you don't have a problem with them.   If we go down this road, the argument will distill down to a passing match about whether or not mental development makes one more a person or human than one of lesser mental capabilities.   Wasn't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged? I am well justified to go down this road.

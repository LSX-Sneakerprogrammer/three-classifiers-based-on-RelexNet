If you and your spouse have no STDs and you have sex with no one else how could you possible get an STD apart from a mishap at the doctors?   1. kissing your mom during a herpes outbreak, then making oral with your spouse.  2. a bar fight   3. eating an infected chimp you didn't cook long enough with an open soar in your mouth  4. forgetting to cover a public toilet seat after someone with an outbreak on their thighs forgot to put the cover on a public toilet seat  Probably many more.  But that's not the point. The point is people have been having sex with or without protection for hundreds of thousands of years, and they're not about to stop now no matter how hard you stuff your fingers in your ears and how loud you yell "LALALALALALA" with your eyes closed while stomping your feat and praying.  keep trying though

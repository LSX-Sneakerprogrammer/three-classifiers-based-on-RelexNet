Killing an unborn baby is murder it is still a life     Oh good grief... how can you possibly be this dense?    Who cares  if it's "a life"? The mosquito I swatted earlier was "a life". The weeds on my lawn are "a life".   SOMETHING BEING A LIFE IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION!!!!  Would you get this through your skull already?

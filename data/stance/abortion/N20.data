Give me a few more years and I suspect I'll be 99% pro-life as my opinion continues to evolve the older I get. At this point I believe it should be rare... only in the first trimester and only once... not to be used as a form of birth control. As for rape and incest, I don't know if I will ever believe that abortion shouldn't be allowed in those cases.

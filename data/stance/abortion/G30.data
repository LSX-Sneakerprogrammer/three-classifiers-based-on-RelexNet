Well if you say yes then it seems that the laws have a right to infringe upon the body of the mother even if it means that it is against the choice of the mother.   I did not say this at all and I am baffled as to how you came to this conclusion.   According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.    I have given my reasons why the fetus-mother relationship could be defined as parasitic in  literally  every post since the issue came up. If you are going to blatantly ignore them, I am not going to rephrase them  again .   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised.   Abortion is legal.  Murder is not legal.  Therefor, legally, abortion cannot be murder.   And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus.    I do not agree with this precedent unless the fetus has passed the threshold of viability.    Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?   Sorry, abortion is still not murder and yes, it should be a right to women.   I am not trying to claim that fetuses are dead, so I am not sure why you brought that up. I realize that they are alive. I just do not put that expression of life on the same level of the expression of life you see in actual conscious human beings.   Animals are alive but they are not considered human. That was kind of my point. Being composed of living tissue does not automatically mean you are a human and you get all the rights that come along with that.   Thank you. You said it yourself. Your skin cells cannot develop into a human or heart so stop comparing it to a fetus.   Don't ignore the part of the sentence that is inconvenient to you. An aborted fetus is equally incapable of developing into a human.

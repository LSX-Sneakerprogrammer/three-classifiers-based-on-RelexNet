This is my argument for all the pro-lifers out there:  Pro-lifers argue that all human beings, born or not, have human rights. And with those human rights comes the right to live. Therefore abortion should be made illegal.   Here are the holes I have found in this argument:  When a mothers' unborn child is in the womb, pro-lifers claim it has human rights and the mother should not be able to terminate the pregnancy. But in the instance that the unborn child is harming the life of the mother, the pregnancy is terminated. So in this case, the unborn child is then stripped of its human rights, and the mothers rights trump the unborn child's.   So which is it, pro-lifers? Does an unborn child have human rights or doesn't it?

Show me where in the bible that god forgives deliberate, planned murder.   I don't care what the Bible says God forgives and doesn't forgive. Plenty of other people don't, either.   But, just for fun:  http://www.evilbible.com/Murder.htm    If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation.   As abortion is currently legal, this is no longer an 'if' scenario. Some may say we are in dire straights as a country, but I doubt it is because the government places the rights of a conscious citizen above the interests of an unconscious fetus.   Additionally, it is judgmental and tunnel-visioned to assert that only stupid people get pregnant accidentally. Do not place yourself on a pedestal above people who find themselves in this situation.   If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world.   I think it would take a very strong mental constitution  not  to be psychologically harmed by carrying to term a pregnancy resulting from rape. I certainly admire the women who decide to do so, but women who decide not to do not deserve punishment; they deserve compassion and support because they have suffered enough.  There is no shortage of available orphans. A woman who chooses to have an abortion (for any reason, not just rape or health-related) is not cruelly ripping away some innocent stranger's dream of having a child.    When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.   Earlier, it seems you implied abortion is acceptable if carrying the pregnancy to term will harm or kill the mother. Correct me if I am wrong and I will revise. Because it is for a reason you consider valid, it is no longer murder? If the answer is yes, it is still murder, why do you allow murder in some cases but not others? If the answer is no, it is no longer murder, why should your opinion be the determining one for deciding what is a valid reason to get an abortion?  She is not really stating facts, she is rambling incoherently, getting worked up, and ignoring opposing arguments. If you are her parent, you may want look around this site and see what the average discourse consists of, for the sake of both herself and the site. She may be a little young to participate.

The vulnerability of a woman is completely irrelevant. So, vulnerability is your justification for double homicide of a pregnant woman with a fetus, yet a woman getting a abortion is not because the fetus is not human.  I am vulnerable of getting hit by a car walking the street, so should the driver of the car be charged with murder or manslaughter?   You asked why and I told you some of the potential reasoning behind it. I don't agree with it either.

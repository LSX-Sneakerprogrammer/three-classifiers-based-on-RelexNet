That's funny: she was so keen on 'evicting' when she had someone's dick up inside her C:  Arguments that say "Cause and Effect don't matter if you don't like it" are also ludicrous. The very purpose of sex IS to have children. That is fact.  I love how people like using things with no regard for the CONSEQUENCES and as soon as they are faced with the consequences they decide to take the easy way out. It's the same thing with people who abuse alcohol.  You get drunk: The result is a hangover.  That's science.  You CHOSE to get drunk.  You also CHOOSE to risk the hangover.  If you can't handle consequences, then don't act on the cause!

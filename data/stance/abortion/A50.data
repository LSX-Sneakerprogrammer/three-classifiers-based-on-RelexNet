1. The left is generally anti-war, pro healthcare, pro helping starving people in Africa, etc, all of which saves lives. Since I don't consider a fetus a life, from my standpoint the right is more concerned with vague moral standards only shared by the right than saving lives, but whatever.  2. I'm talking about self-awareness, as in feelings. A fetus before the third trimester has 0 capacity to feel. They're not sad about being aborted, it doesn't hurt them, they don't have these human emotions yet. This is what I'm talking about. That an already born child likes its mom in no way invalidates this point.  3. And here is the disconnect, you are absolutely correct. But the leap so many on the right are not willing to make is that abortion is  always  something to anguish over. Sure, there are bitches (and I don't use that term lightly) who simply don't care. But the vast vast vast majority of abortions are performed by women who feel they simply have no choice. It is  not  a party. But it's  their  choice, something  they  have to live with. Not the right wing, not you personally, just her, no one else's business. The only thing making abortions illegal would change is the number of mothers who die with the child. That's all it changes no matter how pretty this anti-abortion idea that "if we just shove what we really really really feel down everyone's throat everyone will live happily ever after, amen" - that's not how it works. Woman have been having abortions one way or another, legal or illegal, since the beginning of time.  As for your point about rape. It's not the fault of the "child" only because the "child" doesn't exist. It's a cluster of cells and if she wants to abort it it's her choice, again, not yours.  4. facts and logic never vary. People are wrong about facts and logic, but in and of themselves, they are constant. It is a  fact  the earth is round for example. Some have the "opinion" it is not, but this is not an opinion, this is simply wrong. There is a fact at the bottom of when a fetus becomes self-aware, people who study biology for a decade before becoming a doctor believe this to be around the 3rd trimester. Whatever the answer really is, I trust the dude who studied it for a decade over people who think they speak in tongues and give their live savings to Jerry Falwell. Is the exact moment as definite as the shape of the earth? No, probably not. But it's not  that  big a mystery, and while a valid opinion may vary by a month or so of when this elusive self-awareness begins, it most certainly is  not  upon conception, or even 2 or 3 months later. It's akin at that point to saying the earth has to be flat because when I stand on my roof I can't see it curve.  Here's the difference between an argument with two different opinions, and the abortion debate.  Indulge me, I enjoy coming up with analogies.  2 people are walking through a forest. 1 wants to go left, the other right. The one who wants to go right says they both have to go right. The one who wants to go left says his friend can go right if he likes, but for himself, he thinks he should be able to choose.  That's the gist of it. It's not a matter of two sides fighting about what everyone should do. It's about one side trying to force everyone to do something they may or may not want to and the other saying since we really don't know where either leads, people should have the choice.

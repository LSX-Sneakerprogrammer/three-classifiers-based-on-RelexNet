Um, have you ever had sex? lol It's kind of fun. Not too mention it's great for relationships.   Sex isn't just for reproducing anymore. We've made it where we can have sex for pleasure.   It's narrow-minded to just think of sex just as reproducing. It's also no fun if you think of it just like that.

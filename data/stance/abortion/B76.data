You forget that she's from the UK. The British don't tend to randomly share such personal information with random people, whether it's kidnehy surgery or abortion. (Yes, that stereotype was satirically intended for the purpose of pointing out that her country is different then ours.)  That's hypocritical for you to say. In fact, that's contradictory. ;) If the circumstances don't matter to you, then the circumstance of the mother dying on the table shouldn't matter either. You're a big fat hypocrite. REAL pro-life people I've talked to think the mother should  die .  Circumstance is the only thing that matters in anything, ever. If you value  all  life, then you are an idiot. If you value all  human  life, then you're supposed to treat them with empathic logic, the only logic of morality. People are numbers in the end. If you don't treat them like numbers and instead like individuals, more will be lost then gained. You can't just say that it's right to let the mother die because abortion is murder, because that, by definition, is incentive to murder. If you value all  human  life, you can't say that euthanazia is right, but letting a mother die in childbirth is euthanazia. According to your logic, you'd have to choose in between murder and murder.   And that's why circumstance is the only factor that matters.   What if a doctor like you is in that situation described above? What is he supposed to do? What he's SUPPOSED to do is abandon your false logic! It is not logic because it does not factor in the unpredictable variable that is circumstance! If you want to do the right thing, you have to think of everyone and everything as a whole, not  one  specific factor in the equation! You can't solve for x in an xy equation without also solving for y!   Your logic tries to solve for  just  x.  As you can see, that is impossible. That's why I don't agree with either radical side of this debate. If you really care about people and life, neither should you.

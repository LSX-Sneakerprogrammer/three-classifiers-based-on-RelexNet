It's the girl's fault for not taking birth controls, having the guy use a condom, or using any other type of protection when having sex. I know that women have their own rights, but if they didn't use any kind of protection, and are underage, then it's their fault and responsibility.  I only agree to abortion if the women was raped and then became pregnant, other than that I am against it.

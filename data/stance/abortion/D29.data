I agree that intelligence and desire are two different things but...  Sex is pleasurable, but it is still procreation.  If you are smart, you will know that birth control fails. If you are intelligent and want to have sex, but don't want a child, you will re-think the sex.   What child deserves to die simply because his 'genius' mom doesn't think he should inconvenience her? It was her mistake that created him, not his. Why should he lose his life, which is his own, because he depends on her for survival but she doesn't feel like taking care of him?

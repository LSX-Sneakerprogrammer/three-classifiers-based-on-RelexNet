Trixxsta, you are so right! I also went to the Freakonomics theory of abortion that was suggested by Loudacris...which I agree, he must not have read much of, if any, since it completely undermines his point ! All lives are precious, and the real freaks are the ones who think they are better, or think that they can cut corners on research where they think it won't be noticed, as the authors of Freakonomics did. Throughout history countless children were unplanned that turned out great...and remember there is adoption. Spoiled disrespectful children, who WERE wanted may be a bigger problem now. If this " Freak" theory was correct then prisons should be emptying out not filling to overflowing like they are now ! Killing innocent unborn babies is simply not the answer. Less selfishness, and more tender loving care and respect is. .

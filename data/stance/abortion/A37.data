... okay, I just looked at it.  So what exactly did Bush want that he didn't get? I see nothing here... including that bs war in Iraq, the unconstitutional "Patriot" Act, and that 900 billion dollar tax cut that didn't do jack to help the economy.  That's not really the point though.  This is about abortion,  go ahead, try and make it illegal.  The world has been through this a dozen times, and for hundreds of years.  Illegal Abortions prevent 0 abortions from happening, and kills woman that have to go to basements and the homes of people who may or may not be doctors to get the procedure, and who often die as a result.  Amen right man ._.

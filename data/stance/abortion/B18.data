So a husband and wife that don't want children can never have sex.... Contraceptives fail.   So two people who don't want children can not get married - lack of sex is a slam dunk claim for divorce or annulment. You are required to fulfill your marital duties or your partner can divorce you in almost every state. In addition a healthy sex life is cited by almost all marriage councilors as vital to maintaining a healthy marriage.   So how would a childless (by choice) couple be acting irresponsibly? In addition what is the difference to you?  Either they are going to have sex and and abortion (if they get pregnant), or they are going to abstain so as not to take the risk of getting pregnant if abortion is made illegal.   Guess what - either way, no child is ever born. That couple has decided not to bring a child into this world under any circumstances. Personally I don't think they should have to go their whole lives without having sex.

It's probably because a pregnant woman is seen as being more vulnerable, and motherly, so killing such a person is especially heinous.   The vulnerability of a woman is completely irrelevant. So, vulnerability is your justification for double homicide of a pregnant woman with a fetus, yet a woman getting a abortion is not because the fetus is not human.  I am vulnerable of getting hit by a car walking the street, so should the driver of the car be charged with murder or manslaughter?

Abortion is not murder - as it destroys a collection of cells that can't survive outside of the mother's womb before the 24th week.  If a woman feels she isn't ready for a baby or doesn't have the means to take care of a baby or just doesn't wish to have a baby.  Like any other difficult situation, abortion creates stress. Yet the American Psychological Association found that stress was greatest prior to an abortion, and that there was no evidence of post-abortion syndrome.

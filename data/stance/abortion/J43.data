What? Of course it is their fault. They CHOSE to have sex.   Just like how the Japanese chose to settle in Japan. If there's an earthquake and many people die or are injured in any way like the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, is it their fault? Your entire argument fails if we apply the same standard to any accident.   The definition you gave was not a scientific definition.   So how would you define a "scientific definition"?   I said serious defect.   Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   By that I mean anything that would in all likelihood result in the child's death.   Which is exactly the same position I am arguing for, if you have even bothered to distill my previous arguments. Therefore, I don't understand why you are rebutting me.   It is perfectly normal for a child's brain to develop.   So what? That was not my point. What I said was that I will not stop any mother and/or father from deciding to abort their unborn if they do so within the first trimester because the brain of the fetus hasn't even been formed yet.

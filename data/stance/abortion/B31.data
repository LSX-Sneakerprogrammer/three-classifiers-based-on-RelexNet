Ok what about women who are raped? This is a violent act for sure. But are two acts of violence better than one? I think abortion is a a violent way to kill a living human being. It is not given a sedative...it is ripped, burned and dismembered while the heart beats, when it quite possibly is moving. So how is the act of rape the new living childs fault? If you walked into a nursery in a hospital and the nurse told you that one out of the ten babies theres mother was raped...do you think you could pick it out? No....it has just as much right to life as the child whose mother was not raped. The mother who was raped not only will remember the rape, but the day she...took it upon herself to kill another living person. So if you value life........you value all life and you give it a chance.   You bring up the death penalty.....I am not pro-death penalty...I do believe in prison however...and not prisons with television, internet, and work out rooms.   I did give proof some of the top doctors around the world, researchers...I mean what more do you want? Many of these doctors testified in front of the Senate on when life begins.   And your last question.....  I believe that women know when they have sex they might become pregnant, even if they take precautions. I believe that when a life is started...that that life should be allowed to be born. Nine months is not that long when you know it can save another living persons life. There is always adoption. What is nine months...compared to killing?   This is about doing what is right, not only for the woman but the life growing inside her...that she help start. I do not believe woman should have the right to kill.   You however believe that she does, because IT IS HER BODY. And that right should not be taken away or controlled by anyone else. So let me ask you this......  If the woman wanted to abort in the ninth month, eighth month this would and should be her right.....you certainly would not want her to be enslaved by a baby even in late term........right?   You cant have it both ways.

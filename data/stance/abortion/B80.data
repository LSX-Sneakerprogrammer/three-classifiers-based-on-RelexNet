No they don't. Maybe if they had an appendix removed. But there as so many minor operations people don't talk about because it's  personal . Besides I know people who have had abortions and because I know them personally they have told me about them. Perhaps it's unheard of to you because no one would admit it to such a anti-abortionist radically opinionated person such as yourself.

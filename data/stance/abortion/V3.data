Not only,let's think about what happens to unwanted children when they come into this world.Yes,some of them end up being loved and cherished,but a mother who loses her job and her partner and her emotional sanity because of the child will ALWAYS ressent that child,deep down,and then the child will go throughtout hearing the old "Look at all the sacrifices I've done for you!" thing.Not to mention,what about the children whose parents are alcholics,drug addicts,abusers,violent,severely mentally ill?These are the children that end up in the hospital five years later completely destroyed,emotionally and physically,these are the children that are already living in violence and terror before they were even born.This is a controversial statement but sometimes NOT chosing abortion should even be a crime.

I think you are misunderstanding what a logical proposition is. True, we can pretend to debate everything by use of fallacious thoughts, but when an argument is illogical nothing is debated.  However, in a sense we can irrationally argue everything! Agreed!  You have claimed that “all issues are debatable” while at the same time failing to support your proposition. The fallacious arguments you have submitted fail to refute my proposition and consequently indicate that only my proposition, i.e. not all issues are debatable, is axiomatic.   There is not one axiom you have affirmed that is evidence of your assertion, “All issues are debatable”.  The only logical and axiomatic proposition of  this debate  is simply: Some issues are debatable.

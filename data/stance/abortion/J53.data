If you mean disgusting as in 'gross to watch,' then we're in agreement, but that doesn't turn an opinion into a fact.    How dare I speak as if what I think matters!?   More than the thoughts of people actually faced with getting abortions?   If it's necessary it's not really a choice, is it?   If by necessary, you mean something that logically follows and literally cannot be other way, then even your 'necessary' abortions are not necessary. No medical procedures are 'necessary.' After all, people can always 'choose' to let themselves die slow, painful deaths.   I can't decide what's necessary.   You already have. Unless you did actually mean necessary in the logical sense, you've decided 'necessary' means 'necessary to prevent the mother from suffering death or serious injury.' An abortion could be necessary to restore the mother's health a pre-pregnancy level, necessary to maintain a lifestyle that enables a mother to support her existing children, necessary to preserve the mother's mental health, necessary to allow the mother control of her own reproductive life, or necessary for any number of things you've decided are less important than not getting an abortion.    I'd like "doctors" who perform surgeries that don't play a role in maintaining or restoring health to be recategorized as hacks.   Things that would make doctors hacks according to you:  Correcting birth defects such as extra fingers, tails, or deviated septa  Cosmetic reconstructive surgery for accident victims  All exploratory surgeries  ---  Things that wouldn't:  Abortion (unless you can show me that pregnancy does not reduce the mother's health from its pre-pregnancy level, thus making abortion a procedure that restores health)

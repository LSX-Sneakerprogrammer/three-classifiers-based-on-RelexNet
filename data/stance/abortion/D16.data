Who is the woman (or anyone) to say that this baby will not be able to make any choices? What about this potential persons life? What about his or her choices?  And don't start with the whole "it's not a person yet" thing BECAUSE if you left whatever it is alone it would be a person within a few short months anyways! This is about potential. This is about choice. This is about Life.    "Why is this even being discussed in society, really?"   You're so enclosed in your own biased self centered state that you admittedly can't even  comprehend  why the topic of the life of another person is up for discussion?    "Whatever happened to freedom of property, expression and religion?"    You're  the one suggesting that an unborn child shouldn't get a shot at any of those three things if it so be that he or she ends up with an irresponsible parent. What about his or her freedom of property, expression, or religion?

The view of "Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong" is expected of a pro-lifer looking to force his/her belief on others.  Abortion is actually not unjustified. People have very good reasons to do it. It's not a fun activity, so to arrive at the decision people would have had to consider lots of options.   Abortion is also not the taking of a human life. It's the prevention of a human life, same as having sex with a condom, using the pills, abstinence, etc...  Finally, believe what you want, but don't force it on others. I respect pro-lifers' views, they should respect my views. What I do with my body doesn't affect the quality of their lives. Don't affect the quality of mine!

A "thing" inside of a women stomach (cuz we all know that's where the come from) is not a true human being until it comes out into the world. Therefore science should have the ability to complete the task. There is no moral issue here. The problem I and most of you should have is the stupid teenagers who have sex think they have an easy way out. They should have to pay the consequences for their actions. I am still for abortion but there is one big problem I have with it.

Abortion is immoral to anyone with a heart and a sense of what is right and wrong. But our law in America allows a mother to kill her unborn child, as long as she hires it done. If she does it herself she may face being charged with taking a life. Our laws are whishy washy about this. They do not give the unborn personhood and protection, they stand on the principle that its the womans body and then they stipulate when she can have the abortion. Science is clear to when human life starts....and it does not start after nine months of pregnancy.

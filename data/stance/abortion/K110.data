That is Old testament life was more strict back then but if you have "read" the New Testament in the Bible you would have learned we are all set free from the Old Testament.     No you aren't. Jesus approves of the old testament, it's just that the writings are so brutal even you, a supposedly faithful servant, cannot bear to live so uncivilised.  Matthew 5:17-19 (King James Version)   17Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.   18For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.   19Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  Until the second coming, the final judgement, the law of the old testament is to be upheld.

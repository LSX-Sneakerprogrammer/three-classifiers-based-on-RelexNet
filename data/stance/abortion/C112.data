Alright, I can tell you are either very young or have some kind of mental handicap as you have great difficulty grasping the subtleties of language that aren't explicitly explained to you.   I called you a hypocrite because you believe you have the right to force others to conform to your preferences while I don't regardless of the fact that the body in question belongs to neither of us.   I don't care about your sob story. I really don't. If you can't debate outside of emotional appeals then we are done here. You lose.

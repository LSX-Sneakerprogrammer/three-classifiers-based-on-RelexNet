I gave you scientific evidence where science says that once sperm meets egg, it is another living human being. Can't you read?   The thing is.....you have not done research on this topic. You have not even looked to see what science says about this. If you did you would know you are wrong. The sperm was alive, when it met the egg which was alive.   There is no moral middle ground on this...you cant sit the fence. You are pro-abortion because you say the woman has the right to choose. And if you give her this right, then who the heck are you to tell her when she can and cant abort....because thats personally when YOU THINK, it should be saved. You wont listen to what science says about life in the beginning........you ignore it....then you bring up what science says when fetus is viable. This is not balanced thinking at all. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMANS RIGHTS?

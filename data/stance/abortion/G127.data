Really? So how come when a person commits suicide the state has every right to stop that person from doing it? Why don't you answer that then?   It's because a bunch of angry and sad victims of a suicide decided to give government that right. It has no bearing on a person's autonomy, however.   Why do you keep saying her body. The fetus is inside her body but not her body. The fetus has a completely different DNA and blood type than the mother and if the blood type of the fetus comes in contact with the blood type of the mother it can be fatal.   Parasites, bacteria, and protists all have different DNA from us but still reside within us. We have the final say over their existence because they reside in our bodies.

this is a tiresome argument.  as long as people are buying slaves and people (women and men) wanna sale that slave, then we will have slavery regardless of laws, so-called morals, etc.  the answer is adequate 1) slavery information and 2) improved availability of slavery since historically (stupid) efforts to slavery have failed   Hope that clears up the mental smog for you :)

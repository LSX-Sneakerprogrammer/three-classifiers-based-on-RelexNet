Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged. And I will wear that label with honor.  But tell me why you think no one likes getting an abortion, and why everyone would be happier if there were less abortions.     And about that "clump of cells" are they cancer cells? if not, what kind of cells are they?  Finally,   In addition, we already have systems in place that grant increasing rights with age, so I don't see how this case is any different.   True, however life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guarantied to all of them expect those in the early stages of development, those in their mothers womb. That's discrimination based on level of development and that's just plain wrong. The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be a mother's womb

Yes, There is no shame, women fail to carry a fetus to term more often than not without artificially inducing rejection, medical abortion only artificially induces this natural process, the artificiality of inducing this seems like it has no more moral significance than it occuring naturally. This is because the fetus doesnt develp consciousness until the onset of the third trimester - prior to this point (more than ~99% of all abortions occure in the 1st trimester) there is no moral status to the actions taken with regards to the preservation of the fetus. This is true for surgical abortions too since they also occure during the first trimester.   The morality of abortion has to do with the freedom to have them, not the act of doing them, since the act of doing them is for all reasonable accounts an a-moral action. It should be everyone's right to have an abortion because people should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.

Am I to gain from this the understanding that you believe abortions are acceptable in the occasional case that the pregnancy is harmful?  If so, if the fact that the fetus is not a child 'makes no difference to the morality of the action', then why allow would you allow abortion in any case, ever? There are no cases in which the murder of a two-year-old is permissible and if a fetus and a two-year-old are interchangeable, what is the difference? If the end result is identical for the fetus, why would motivation make a difference?

I've agreed with a lot of your argument, but I'm particularly disturbed at the part where you say, "One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out."  This line of thinking is  rational , but some women would use it to justify promiscuity. I believe in abortion in cases where:  - the mother and/or father are too young to support a child, or the mother and/or father are in a situation that would not be a positive environment for a child (ie, abusive relationship(s), poverty/homelessness, etc.);  - the mother's/fetus's life is at risk,  - the fetus is the result of a rape or incestuous encounter;  - the fetus has a  very  high chance of developing some debilitating disease/malformation that will make its developing life difficult.  In women who are promiscuous and take no time to learn about/use contraceptives, they should not use abortion as a Plan B. If they are not ready for a child, and plan to have sex, then they should learn more responsibility and practice safe sex, not just  assume  they won't get pregnant.

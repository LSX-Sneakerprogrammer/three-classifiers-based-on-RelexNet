But it is going to be life most people regret having abortion. Just because it is not completely formed does not mean it is alive. Why is it not okay to murder a kid at lets say 12 but its okay to kill a baby before it is even born?     Because the 12-year old is aware, it is alive. A foetus when aborted 40% of the time isn't alive. It doesn't have a heart, 50% of the time it doesn't have a brain.

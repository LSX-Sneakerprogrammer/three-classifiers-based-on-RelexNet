Lots of parts in the Bible are literal but there are that have a different meaning then what stands out. Jesus said a lot of parables that contained a specific meaning. A lot of science is correct except evolution, the big bang, etc... Your are not a Christian at least for now so your understanding of the Bible is not as great as mine.     Being a Christian has nothing to do with it. I don't have your prejudice and theological blindness, and that is why I don't dismiss scripture that I find inconvenient, like you do. What Jesus said was quite clear but you continue to ignore it because you don't like the outcome of it being true. But hey, ignore me and Jesus on this matter, you apparently think you know more than he did when he was speaking. I guess when you're roasting in the flames of hell, you'll realise your mistake in not following the old testament.

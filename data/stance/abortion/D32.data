I continually go back and forth on this issue weighing the pros and cons. Sometimes I feel as though it should be illegal because if you are responsible enough to be having sexual intercourse you should assume responsibility for a child. However, I agree with the above poster on unsafe conditions for those that will ultimately seek out an abortion whether it is legal or not. There are plenty of irresponsible people having sex and having children. I think abortion should be legal and safe sex practices should be enhanced in schools. Abortion should be the last resort.

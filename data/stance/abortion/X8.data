Does it not go against all reason that person A should have the right to kill person B, if person A finds person B's continued existence to be inconvenient?  A woman may have a right to her body, but by choosing abortion she's affecting the rights of another persons body as well - the child's.   And mental trauma from the abortion is no fitting punishment for murder. We don't let people freely walk away from unwillingly killing other people just because they feel bad about it.

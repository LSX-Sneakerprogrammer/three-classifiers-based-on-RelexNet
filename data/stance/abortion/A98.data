Read what I was replying to. I was being facetious.  Following the logic of the statement I was replying to, it would wrong to have an abortion ever under any circumstance, but something like say, stabbing a pregnant dog in the vagina, would be just fine... if one were to follow the logic,  which it's become quite apparent few posting under this topic are capable of.

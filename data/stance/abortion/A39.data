1. duh, the point is these woman are going to have an abortion whether it's banned or not. So either the cluster of cells is removed and the woman lives. Or the cluster of cells is removed and the woman dies. Either way, abortion being banned has never in human history stopped people from getting abortions.  2. No, it didn't make it rare, that's the point. Banning abortion doesn't stop it, it just hides it and demonizes woman, who many times are only children at the time, and who many times were raped. And you wonder why no one likes talking hardcore Christians about this kind of thing.  3. wtf? have you been reading the white supremacist newsletter again? Europe's population is doing just fine. And there's nothing wrong in and of itself if they do end up having more muslims than whatever they have now. Who cares? Why's it your business what someone else does?  And who the fuck is "we" you arrogant ass. The US does not have a "we"   we're supposed to be founded on the idea of diversity and freedom. I find this entire post incredibly offensive, and you get a rare downvote from me.

Um...  I remember this one girl walking down the street in 1999, and everytime I think of me not getting her pregnant I miss the 12 year old that could have been.   Ergo since I feel this way men should just impregnate every woman they have a moment's urge to impregnate, otherwise we'll all be sad and junk.  Basically, it's a bad argument as heartfelt for you as it may be.

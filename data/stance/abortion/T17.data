Even if a zygote or early term fetus was a person (which it isn't)...  And even if that person had all the rights that other people have (which it doesn't)....     I    sure as hell don't have the right to commandeer someone else's body against their will for nine months to keep myself alive and neither does a fetus. The only way to argue that a woman doesn't have the right to terminate a pregnancy she doesn't want is to declare her body to be a piece of property that she doesn't have the right to final say over the use of. And it's just that simple.

Abortion should be consider illegal. it is not the unborn child's fault that they was to be given life. the ones who conceded the child are at fault. even if the child is unborn the child should still have every other right to live as any other human being for the child is a human being too. and it would be murder and disgrace to kill a child that has yet to be born and to kill a innocent child who has convicted no crime unless you call being alive and wanting to live a crime, then in that case everyone in the human race has committed a crime.

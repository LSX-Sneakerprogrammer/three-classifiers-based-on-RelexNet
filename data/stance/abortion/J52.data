No, it isn't. That is an opinion.   Is it in dispute then that abortion causes disgust?   A little public shaming never hurt anyone, right?   Embarrassment and progress go hand and hand. Be my friend embarrass me. :)   You speak as if your definition of the 'unnecessary' is the one that matters.   How dare I speak as if what I think matters!?   I'm sure you understand that many people actually getting abortions consider it absolutely necessary...and without understanding their circumstances, you're advocating public hostility towards their choice.   If it's necessary it's not really a choice, is it?   What qualifies you to decide what is necessary and unnecessary for strangers   I can't  decide  what's necessary. Something is either necessary or it's a choice.   what social punishment they should receive if they don't obey your standards?   Well my standard, should I be able to persuade people to adopt it, is that a surgical procedure should not be undertaken unless there is a clearly established health benefit to be gained from it being carried out.  I'd like "doctors" who perform surgeries that don't play a role in maintaining or restoring health to be recategorized as hacks.

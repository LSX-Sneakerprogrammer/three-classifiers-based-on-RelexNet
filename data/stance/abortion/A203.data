Putting more children up for adoption when there are already hundreds of thousands of children waiting to be adopted is ridiculous if you really think about it. Most of these children are put into foster care where they spend part of their lives with 6 or 7 other kids being miserable because they are being moved around 15 or 16 times in a year. We have all heard about how traumatizing foster care can be for a lot of children who end up having a lot of mental issues and distress when they are older. Yeah you may be keeping a child a live but when you think about what they have to go through as children in the system is it really worth it? And not to mention if they do get adopted young and find out when they are older it is going to be extremely hard for them. When people get abortions the baby cant process it or know!! What is the baby going to miss or know if they are never born nothing. Its not like they are going to be born to another family and say oh yeah i had a mother once but she got rid of me before i was born.

Like i said you need someone to interpret the Bible for you so...  Here is a link:  http://www.godandscience. org/apologetics/ notkill.html#r0N2AWDBfggn       In other words you don't like what the bible says and need someone else to read it for you. You don't even know what the religion you follow teaches, instead you follow the words of people other than your supposed holy book as infallible.

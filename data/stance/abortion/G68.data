First of all, don't argue about something you can't even spell correctly. Second, abortion is completely wrong whether or not it is economically beneficial to an adoption market. Third, if adoption is truly a market, then the correct name is human trafficking, and you mean to tell me abortion is fixing that? Please. Most abortions occur in high school teenagers, so an overworked mother is out of the question for the most part. I am so adamant about this because my mother had two abortions before my birth. I am now a junior in high school with a 3.48 GPA. Abortion is supposed to fix that?

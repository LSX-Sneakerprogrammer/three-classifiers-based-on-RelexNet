It is a choice. And when abortion was illegal the majority of women had their babies. Less women got pregnant because they knew that abortion was really not an option…it was hard to find illegal abortion clinics and doctors that would perform them. So they thought twice about having sex. Now abortion is an option and many women use it as birth control.  You can't be both. You either want abortions legal…or you want protection for the unborn and want it illegal. One thing your not…Pro-life…not if you want abortion legal. Thats like child abuse. Looking away you know its wrong but its your neighbors right to do it. Do you help the children no.   Now rape is a serious violent act and it is wrong. But that which is created is still a child, innocent at that. It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped. So the rape is one violent act…and abortion is the next. The mother chooses to violently end her childs life.   I have known people who have used birth control but still got pregnant. Accidents happen…but, you still are taking the risk…because no birth control is 100% effective…..unless you get fixed. We live in a sexually active society. If more women are keeping their babies because they are not looked down on by society anymore. More couples live together today than get married. TV, radio, magazines, movies…..in general foster the idea that if it feels good it can't be that bad. We are a sexual society and we celebrate the deviant. Kids know about sex earlier than ever today. So I highly doubt that if women have sex they don't know what can happen. Accidents happen…and women know that.   It is sad that what you morally disagree with you don't have the guts to stand up for. So you help to paint a bullseye on every child who is conceived in its mothers womb.

It is not an accident. It is the sole purpose of sex naturally.   You are attacking a straw man. I did not say that having a baby was an accident. I was saying that the failure of contraception was an accident. The failure of contraception might not lead to pregnancy, no matter how high the probability. If you were to argue this point, you would be going down a very slippery slope. Furthermore, an appeal to nature is hardly a cogent argument.   The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring.   I think that you'll find yourself to be wrong there.   Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   But that is not the fault of the people using the contraceptives.   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Nope. I don't think so. I won't let you back away from your own challenge so easily.   And none of which are usually fatal.   You are attacking another straw man argument. I've never claimed it to be fatal. It doesn't have to be fatal to be bad or wrong. The point is that if an organism lacks rationality, autonomy  and  self-consciousness, it is no more than a mechanical machine that can be terminated without such an act being considered morally wrong.   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases.   I admit that. But you haven't actually posed any significant challenge to me on those cases.   An immature brain is not a defective one.   Did I even make that point?   Hence my point that it all distills down to a meaningless argument.   Right. This is purely an assertion without justification.

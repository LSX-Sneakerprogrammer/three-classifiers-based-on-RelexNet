"It moves, it eats, it grows, it thinks.  Are these not all the contributing factors of how our bodies are alive?"  Absolutely, and I think that most of us on the pro-choice side would agree that a woman's right to chose ends by the time a fetus reaches the stage where it eats or thinks.  But the anti-abortion side is not content with that. They want to outlaw abortion from the very moment of conception, at which time the "organism" as you call it does not eat, does not move and does not think.

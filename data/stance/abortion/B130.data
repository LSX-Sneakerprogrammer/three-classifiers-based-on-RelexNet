What I define as moral is what I have learnt is correct and righteous from the World. Certain things require to be excused. There cannot be just an ending. There always is a story. An abortion done for reasons cuz you made out with out protection is Bizzare. But,sometimes abortion is a requirement. My Best Friend's neighbour had an abortion. That abortion was needed cuz not only was she physically unfit but also mentally imbalanced. If they let the baby grow in her, she would probably harm the baby before he met the World. I'm not trying to side anyone's reason. I'm just saying that the World has to work in accordance with the right amount. You cannot just make plain judgments as being in a society where you can place yourself in a million situations where a better choice could have made a huge difference, instead of just opting for a solution that seemed to you had no other choice.

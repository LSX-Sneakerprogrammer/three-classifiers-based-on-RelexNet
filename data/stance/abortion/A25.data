The first question that needs to be asked is " what kind of life is it?" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.   That is an example of what is called jumping to conclusions. You have not established that it abortion is never justified. Even if it is agreed (which I do agree with you) that it is a human life.

The principle of pro-abortion: Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.   Welcome to a self-evident truth.  1. The pro-abortionists could dispute the words of the principle, but in doing such the pro-abortionist must necessarily contradict the pro-abortionist view.   2. The anti-abortionist has no reason to debate the principle because the truth of the principle is self evident.   Don’t make the mistake of thinking that anti-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born offspring. And furthermore, you will not be mistaken if you think pro-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born progeny for themselves.   Now, let’s see if you and I can  logically debate the principle  I have affirmed of pro-abortionists.  Seriously, let’s attempt a debate amongst one another as a test of my ability to reason. Good luck!

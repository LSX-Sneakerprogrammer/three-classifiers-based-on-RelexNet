great ._.  1. Who's worried about trees? It just doesn't make sense to cut all of them down without planting new ones, since then all humans would die, born or not.  2. Um, kids are self-aware, they just don't develop  empathy  until sometime after birth. But a new born has feelings, knows when it's hungry, etc. Therefore it's wrong to throw them in dumpsters.  3. True, and it's state to state. But even the states that do allow it up to birth, again it is only in extreme circumstances. If I'm a woman in  any  state and I'm due in a week, and my life is not in danger, and I'm not a child myself and I wasn't raped by my dad or something, then abortion is not an option. And I'm fine with that actually, I think it's the right law.  4. About 2 or 3 months ago I'd say 5 right wing nuts showed up here and downvoted nearly every argument I've ever made in my over a year on this site. It's why I don't show up as often.  If someone wants to disagree fine, but use facts and logic. I'm tired of having the Bible quoted at me, responses rife with logical fallacies, responses that didn't bother to read what I wrote, and those who need to announce their faith before making an argument when their faith has 0 to do with the argument.   I never downvote or insult anyone just because I disagree, I do so when they act like a moron, whether I agree with them or not.

I actually believe that abortion should be allowed to be performed in at least the first trimester. I hate this issue though, because I'm fairly wishy-washy on it, considering this is more of a battle of morals and logic than anything.  If a child is going to grow up miserable, or die several days after, might as well just kill it before it has a chance to live in that short agony. And rape babies, nobody is going to want to keep. Incest is... gross, but I'm guessing if it's consensual, then whatever. They probably won't want to get rid of it.

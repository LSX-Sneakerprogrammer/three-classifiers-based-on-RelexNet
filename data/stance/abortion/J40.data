But to declare them to be irresponsible, by your own definition of what irresponsible parents are supposed to act like, would be presumptuous.   How so?   "Technically" does not necessarily imply hesitance and doubt. I used it in the sense of "by definition".   semantics...   No, we aren't. A zygote may be alive, but it is not a homo sapien.   How does human not equal homo sapien scientifically?   I can give thousands of definitions from the OED which is very much inline with the scientific community's.   And I can give many that are not.   Rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are the characteristics that sentient beings are supposed to possess, and this is not exhaustive   I thought you would have thought this out more. If we go down this road, the argument will distill down to a passing match about whether or not mental development makes one more a person or human than one of lesser mental capabilities.

Well, if you read my argument towards iamdavidh's argument on potential life in regard to sperm cells, you will understand that there are major differences to what is potential and what is actually fertilizing as we type.  The fact that women consider an abortion as the first choice (or for that matter any choice) is too weak for some people, this includes me.  What individuals fail to see, and admit, is that there is always another option, whether it be putting the child up for adoption or to leave the child in the care of a friend or family member, so that the child has a life and it is still able to give a couple what they actually want.  People are so financial these days that they forget about human rights, something that a child deserves. We can all look at what science determines is a child and what isn't, but it is but some of us, who actually believe and support human life, will look as a fetus as a child, regardless of its understanding and capabilities.  If someone isn't fit or capable of having a child, have safe sex, or if it is too late, give the child to someone who is. Everybody wins.

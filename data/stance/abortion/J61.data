I rather you but out unless you'd like to discuss how to (not just how not to)logically establish whether something is wrong or right.   There isn't any easy way to establish whether something is "right or wrong". But, a judgement on whether something is "right or wrong" is a judgement based on moral  duties . However, any judgement as such should be supported by arguments that fulfill both truth conditions.

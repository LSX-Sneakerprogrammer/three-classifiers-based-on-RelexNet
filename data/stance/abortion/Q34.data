I believe that abortion cannot be justified because it is killing an innocent human being.  Every child is a precious and unique gift from God. We have no right to destroy this. Moreover, United Nations declaration says children have a right to protected before as well as after birth! And if it is not possible for your to have a baby, due to shortage of money or time... Nowadays many couples would adopt unwanted babies.

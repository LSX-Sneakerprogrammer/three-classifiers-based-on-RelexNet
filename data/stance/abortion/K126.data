NOPE...... we talk about life here... and fetus don't have a life... they don't have heart.. and they don't even have any brain to think( in young age of pregnancy i mean..), whether they agree to eliminate by someone or not..( yeah, human right..)  so... i bring new proposal in this case.. ABORTION IS KILLING AN INNOCENT LIFE WHEN ABORTION TRANSPIRE IN OLD AGE OF PREGNANCY... AND ABORTION IS JUSTIFIABLE IN YOUNG AGE OF PREGNANCY..   any rebuttal?

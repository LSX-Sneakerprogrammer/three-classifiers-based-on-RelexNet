First of all, do you know what a comma or period is? Because your whole argument is just one huge sentence... Break it up.    Abortion is wrong sure there are instances that people think that it is right but it never is   It's not right even if the mother will die during childbirth? Or if it is a fact that the child will be born with a disorder that will make it suffer all it's life and die in only about ten years after birth? It's still wrong then?   give the baby up for adoption but still be apart of its life   Some people are against adoption in the same way you are against abortion. They simply can't go through with it. And you can't always be apart of it's life once you put it up for adoption, nor do some people want to.     I have noticed that the people that say abortion is right are alive and their parents didnt go through an abortion   ... This is the stupidest argument ever, if any parent did then it would irrelevant. And I have, on many occasions, which my mother had had another abortion when I was conceived. She suffered greatly by deciding to keep me and my twin brother, and I wish she had simply aborted us and lived a better life for herself.

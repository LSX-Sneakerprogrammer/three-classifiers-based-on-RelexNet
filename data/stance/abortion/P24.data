Abortion should be legal.As someone has already said,women have the right to their own body and if a baby needs to be terminated then so be it.  Especially if any women have gone through rape or any hard situation and it causes pregnancy then its the mothers choice.Especially if the baby wasn't wanted or was a mistake.

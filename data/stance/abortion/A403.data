You can't get pregnant or contract an STD if your not having sex outside of marriage.   Well, that's totally goofy and wrong. Married women get pregnant all the time. (Oh and here's a total shocker: not all married women  want  to get pregnant.) And of course if your spouse has an STD and you have sex with your spouse, you can catch it.  Nor does abstinence "provide 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy," since rape and child molestation do happen.  And finally, there are a great many "questions when it comes to abortion" -- including the safety and wellbeing of the woman, the privacy of family decisions, the right to bodily autonomy, the state's interest in the life and health of its citizens, the relative value that should be placed on the life of the developing being, and the stage of development at which such value should attach or be assessed -- just to name a few off the cuff.

As I have already mentioned, several times, other choices are avaliable, and yet, many couples/individuals choose to ignore these choices. What I suggest is that protective sex must come into play, this way, we can completely forget about the possibility of an abortion.  The only exception that I could possibly see to this is with the case of rape, and this is only covers 1% of all abortions.  If abortions are outlawed, the world may finally smarten up when it comes to sex and childbirth, and then, just maybe, we can start worrying more about the future of the child rather than the beginning.

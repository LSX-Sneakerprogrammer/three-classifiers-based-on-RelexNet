The true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion.   You know, this is actually a common thread amongst conservatives, especially the fundamentalists.  For example, they are against HPV and HIV vaccines and cures because they believe these diseases are deserved punishments for (in their view) immoral behaviour. They are against contraception because that removes the consequences they believe ought to follow from sex out of wedlock. They are against abortion because an unexpected newborn to them is some form of life lesson for (in their view) immoral behaviour and it is essentially punishment.  For the rest of us, I suppose that holding a person's future in your hands and choosing to ruin their lives as some sort of moral lesson designed to teach that the arbitrary morals held by a particular group are rules of nature, is frankly ghastly.   The second major issue I have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born...that is scientifically speaking utter garbage...revealing a lack of understanding about human biology.   Just to set the record straight, I have no emotional issue with infanticide or homicide if it has a rational basis. Quite frankly, the newborn brain is still simple enough that I see no moral dilemma if the newborn must die for a rational reason. I set the ethical cut-off point at birth for the sake of convenience.   Creating an ultimate test of sentience and consciousness and then applying it to a large sample of foetuses as they mature and are birthed in order to definitively answer when a newborn has a mind capable of thought and awareness that we would call human is a task that is presently beyond us. Further it forgets that abortion is and always was the personal choice of the mother, since it is her body, and rationality dictates that an adult mind ought to have priority when compared to a developing mind.   Abortion is murder.  Pure and simple.  I am no christian incidently...my premise is entirely logical.   Murder is the unauthorised (illegal) killing of an individual. A foetus is not an individual (it has no sense of self or identity caused by unique memories), and it is not illegal to kill them. Therefore it is not murder.  Have you ever seen a foetus?

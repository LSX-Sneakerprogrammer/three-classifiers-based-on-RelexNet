1. I was talking specifically about placing a child into the adoption system. Learn to read. I don't have a problem with ditching something. The problem as I see it is when a mother would sooner impose a life of lovelessness and misery onto her child than to just terminate it's life.   If YOU personally think it's okay to make other persons miserable so long as it keeps your conscience clear, fine, but that makes you an egotistical asshole to me.  2. Given logic as the means to decide who is correct, she is objectively wrong in a factual manner.  3. You don't even know my disputes. You're writing me off before you even know why the bible is garbage, this is a logical fallacy on your part.  4. No, by definition "humans" are a species. Biology 101. Look it up.  5. How is this contradictory to what I wrote? You're statement was still non-cognitive opinion. Besides, you're "God" aborts far more babies than humans do.  6. What colour is the sky in your fantasy world? Just because persons are allowed to get abortions doesn't mean they necessarily will. Lots of mothers place their children up for adoption despite being allowed to abort the fetus, hence the surplus of orphans.  7. No, you've decided it's your business because you're an egotistical hypocrite. You don't automatically have the "right" to force others to conform to your personal preferences just because others don't agree with you.  8. Well you were wrong. Don't worry, I'm sure God will forgive you for your prejudice nature. ;)  9. "XD" is a laughing emoticon. Welcome to the Internet.   I didn't even use a single negative, so you're comment makes no sense what so ever.   10. A mother who truly loves their child will abort it if she can't support it. There's already enough persons in the world. The only reason why mothers who otherwise would get abortions DON'T is because of the guilt your dogma imposes on them. Therefore they aren't choosing to not abort the fetus out of love, they're doing it out of guilt.

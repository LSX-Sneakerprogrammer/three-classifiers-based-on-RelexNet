1. I've yet to see anyone ask a pro-lifer this question; what if a fifteen year old girl is raped, impregnated, and still in school and her parents are unable to support the baby, while the rapist is never caught?     2. Many abortions take place because a family cannot support the baby, or the baby will have some sort of mental disorder to prevent him/her from living life to the fullest. Tell me, would the baby be better off in a world where society discriminates against the mentally challenged, or better in Heaven where things will be perfect and the baby can be taken care of?

Well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument? You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right. Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact? The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.  Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone. Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case. And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself. Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you? Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.  If you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name?  Is that all you can say "you came up with it?" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion. Really? But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them? I don't want them to be grateful to me, i want that child to be grateful to me. A life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society.  Well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think. If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?  Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.  You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.  Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.  Well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from.  And lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning. Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do i have to explain everything to you?

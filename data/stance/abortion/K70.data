The error in the syllogism is the distribution of the middle term. And had I distributed the middle term to read:  “Taking an aspirin terminates any biological process.”, it would be valid. Hence the error is in the distribution of the middle term. But that is not the error you have claimed.    You were conflating the wrong subjects in your premises. I tried to point that out with three obviously wrong syllogisms.   Did you assume I am one of the run-of-the-mill participants at CD?  If so, I understand the assumption.    I assumed that your reasoning capabilities were faulty.   Now, having gone through the trial of assessing your comprehension of refutation, twice no doubt, I am left wondering why “taking an aspirin” has any relevance to the abortion of a pregnancy and its attributes.   You responded to my argument that abortion isn't taking a life, as a foetus doesn't qualify. You asked if an abortion ends a biological process, presumably because life is a biological process. I replied that aspirin ends a biological process, implying that a biological process is just another name for metabolism, or biological pathways.  In other words, abortion ends a biological process, but life isn't the only biological process.

By the end of the 1st trimester a baby can think, see, hear, remember, and many other things.  What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering baby nine weeks after birth?  Tell me! I want to know.  An abortion doctor failed to abort a baby and he was born alive. So the doctor took the baby and killed him. The doctor was not charged with murder but was charged with the failure to abort the baby.

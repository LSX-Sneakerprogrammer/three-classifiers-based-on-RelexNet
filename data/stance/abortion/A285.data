Thank you for making my point so well, you are correct. Taking human life requires proper justification. However waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justification. It's a unique human life and there is no way around that without ignoring the obvious. Declaring it to be something else and equivocating on terms may salve your conscience but it doesn't change the reality of what it is. It's reality is not dependent on you, it's determined by what it actually is.  If being thick and asleep keeps me from killing innocent humans in the early stages of development and makes me outraged at their slaughter than I'm guilty as charged and wear those names with honor

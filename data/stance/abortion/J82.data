Why should someone be killed for anther person's mistake?   Is the fetus a person?   The entire purpose of sex is for fertilization to occur. It isn't an "accident" at all.   You are misconstruing my words again. I said that the failure of contraception was an accident. I didn't say that the pregnancy was an accident.  And even if I were to allow you the concession that the accident wasn't an accident, that simply doesn't say  anything  about whether or not abortion is morally wrong or not. To say that it is wrong because the pregnancy wasn't an accident would be to commit the genetic fallacy.   An Earthquake isn't the fault of the people liven near it.   This is  exactly  why you are never coming near refuting my arguments. An earthquake wasn't caused by the people, that's true. But where the people lived was the choice of the people. If you put the blame on the parents for an unwanted pregnancy, it would be equivalent to blaming the people who died in an earthquake that resulted in loss of lives and property even though there are aseismic measures and evacuation plans put in place.

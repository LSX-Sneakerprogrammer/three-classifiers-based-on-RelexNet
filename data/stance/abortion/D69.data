This is obviously a difficult decision to make, and one I have thought out carefully prior to coming to an opinion.   I think, to paraphrase Obama, that expectant mothers are the best people to make the choices about whether or not they are financially and emotionally stable enough to care for a child.   The world is overpopulated as it is. Humans continue to grow at a rate that is unsustainable, and at some point nature will regulate us through some mass disaster/disease. Until then, however, abortion at least offers a little self regulation of population growth.

You forget that denying its life is not a precurser for murder. The whole concept is weather its ethical to deny someones potential to exist before that unborn being has a choice of its own.   However the belief resides in the fact that if that unborn being never comes into existance in the first place, it cant make a choice nonetheless hence it is fallacious to ask weather its ethical to steal the right of a non-existing, un-spiritual and inamite being as rights are exclusivly to the living, not the living of the future.

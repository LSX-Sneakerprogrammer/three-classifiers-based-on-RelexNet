well, heres what i think. its ok to abort an unborn child because it is the parents decision to do so. now, once the baby is actually a living creature in your stomach besides just the fetus, it maybe then could be considered illegal since you are killing a baby, not a fetus. so say the fetus develops into an actuall baby at, i dont know 6 months? am i right, wrong? but when its an actuall  baby  and then you abort, then it may be considered murder, so.. all right i'll just break it down  abortion of a fetus:legal  abortion of a baby:  possibly  wrong

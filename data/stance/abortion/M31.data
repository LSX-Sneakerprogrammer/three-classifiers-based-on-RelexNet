it is a human being, its not a human person. these concepts are distinct, or at least need to be.   I use the definition that it is human as an egg, zygote, and foetus until it is between 14 and 20 weeks old. At that point it is an open question whether it can be described as a person, or a human. Before then, it is tissue without a necessary nervous system.

A religion is a series of canonical texts. The followers may interpret these texts and do deeds in the name of their religion, but that does not mean that they are actually acting under the blessing of the 'religion'.   You'd better tell that to the thousands of sects in Christianity, then, among others. If what you said were true, then we wouldn't have such division among followers.

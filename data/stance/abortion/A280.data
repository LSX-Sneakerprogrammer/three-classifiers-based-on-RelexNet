"The question is not what makes us a person. The question is; what is it?"  This is how you debate??? You simply change the question???   So with that stupid tactic I can just say "the question is not what it is (because we're not debating the fact that it's human. It certainly is human alright.) The question is: is it a person?" If it is a person, why don't we give it a passport while we're at it? Register it for voting too. All fetuses should be represented in parliaments to truly be democratic... You people make me sick how you see things and then force your views on others.

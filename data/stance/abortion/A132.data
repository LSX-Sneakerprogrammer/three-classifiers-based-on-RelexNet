Yes, abortion should be banned. What about adoption? They need to stand up for the mistake they made and have the baby, and if it is unwanted, put it up for adoption. Just don't kill it. I understand that the baby really isn't a baby yet but if a baby isn't wanted, then the person needs to have safe sex. It isn't the baby's fault.

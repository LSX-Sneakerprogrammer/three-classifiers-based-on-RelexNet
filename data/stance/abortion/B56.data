Pro-choice is full of idiocy because unlimited rights in every situation is, of course, ridiculous. You're right, you're supposed to be able to be punished for your actions if you do something stupid. To have the rights to avoid responsibility for every last mistake you make is an abandonment of logic.  Pro-life is full of idiocy because most of the time it is based on the notion that the second a sperm and egg meet and become a single complete cell, they become a human being with all of the same rights of a human being. That is an abandonment of logic.  Logical, truly moral balance is found on middle ground between the two extremes.

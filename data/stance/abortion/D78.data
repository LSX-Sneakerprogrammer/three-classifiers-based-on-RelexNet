Making abortion illegal does not prevent abortions. Those who can afford to circumvent the system will (by going to another state/country/bribing a doctor/etc)--in reality, outlawing abortion hurts poor women more than any other demographic because they are the ones that will turn to back-alley abortions and suffer infection/complications/death because of it.  Also, the government has a greater obligation to the health of the mother than the fetus. We can argue all we want about when life begins, but I'm pretty sure you're not a citizen until after you're born. At least, until they start issuing conception certificates instead of birth certificates.

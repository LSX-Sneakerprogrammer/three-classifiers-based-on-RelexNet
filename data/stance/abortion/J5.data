Admit you're killing a baby...but again..shit happens..it's your choice.  These pro-lifers then, they better be cranking out a baby every time the female produces an egg..or at least tries. By not fertilizing that egg, you are in fact preventing life to live. Are you a dick? Preventing a life to live...killing a life...whats teh difference? You have the power of God either way.

is there any other human beings that are not human persons? if so then it should be legal to kill them according to a argument from sapience/personhood.   Your stating the following:   If something is not a human person, even if it is a human being then it is allowable for it to be killed.   The human person argument has problems, in that more then a fetus can be argued to lack personhood.  are you a human person after birth but before lets say you can crawl? are you a human person if your condition is one of severe down-syndrome? are you a human person if your in a coma. are you a human person when your asleep?  Abortion is not murder simply because the law allows it.   Also the distinction between a human and human is significant but should be more pronounced; "a" is easily overlooked.

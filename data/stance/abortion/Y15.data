Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation.   What's funny is that the number of abortions performed were higher when abortion was illegal than when it was legal, and since Roe vs Wade, abortions have continually decreased, especially since the 80s. And, keeping it illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening. It never has. So instead of a legal procedure, being conducted in a safe environment, we're going to end up with a bunch of illegal abortions, in unsafe and unregulated environments.   At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life.   At the bare minimum, it's the destruction of an accumulation of cells. Depending on the week or trimester, a zygote is not alive--can't even respond to stimuli, and therefore cannot be murdered or killed.   But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children, it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion.   No, it doesn't. A zygote isn't a "class of people", it isn't even a person yet. There are more murders   My position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal.   So? Unconscionable doesn't mean it should be made illegal.

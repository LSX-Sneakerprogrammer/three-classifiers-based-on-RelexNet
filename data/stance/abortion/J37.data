I doubt that you can suggest that parents who use contraception are "irresponsible".   If they are not prepared for the consequences, then yes.   It possess the DNA of a homo sapien, no doubt. But it is not a homo sapien.   Wel...? Don't leave me hangin'.   Didn't I say that I agree it is alive?   You added a "technically" in there which expressed hesitance and some doubt. But this is a good start. We are human life. Apparently we are stuck at the human=homo sapien part.   You are committing the genetic fallacy here.   Haha. Get it? "Genetic" fallacy...? No...ok. Puns aside, how? For example, the colloquial definition of a "theory" and a scientific definition of a "theory" are completely different. I don't accept your givens to be true.   In other words, does it possess rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness?   Irrelevant. I have no interest in arguing the difference in morality between two identical organisms whose inly difference is mental and physical development.

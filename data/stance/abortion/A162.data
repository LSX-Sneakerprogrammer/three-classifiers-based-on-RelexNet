Every sperm is sacred, every sperm is graced;  If a sperm is wasted, God gets quite irate.  Let the heathens spill theirs on the dusty ground --  God shall make them pay for each sperm that can't be found.  Every sperm is wanted; every sperm is good.  Every sperm is needed in your neighborhood!  Hindus, Taoists, Mormons, just spill theirs anywhere,  But God loves those who treat their semen with more care.  Every sperm is sacred! Every sperm is great!  If a sperm is wasted, God gets quite irate!   -- Monty Python

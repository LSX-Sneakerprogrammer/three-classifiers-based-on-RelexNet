Is an acorn a tree? Is an egg a chicken? No. The acorn has a  chance  to become a tree, but it is not.  Is a fetus a human? No. Science has blatantly proven this so many times that I truly question the opposing side's intellectual abilities; abortion is  not  murder. It's the termination of a collection of cells that  cannot  survive outside of the womb because it isn't a human.   Can you feed a 4 week old fetus? Watch it cry? No.

A fetus is not yet a child. It is the product of the woman's body despite it  being viable future offspring. And although males have a stake in this  creation of life they are not the ones who have to take the risks of bearing  children. Pregnancy is a very risky situation for women and I think the  pro-life camp takes this very lightly. Women are responsible for bringing  life into this world, however that responsibility falls into each and everyone  of their hands. Every woman should have the right to decide what's best  for her health. After all it's her body and not yours.

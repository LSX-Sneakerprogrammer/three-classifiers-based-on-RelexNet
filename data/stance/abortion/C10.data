BS foetuses have brains and central nervous systems...they can feel pain and even hear sounds outside of the womb...do you know anything?   A brain is not a mind. They are separate. A mind is a brain with identity.  They respond to sounds and stimuli, they are not really aware. How could they be aware as we think of it when an infant is only starting to develop this aspect of mind?

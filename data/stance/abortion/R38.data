Many proponents of abortion say that it is up to the mother to decide what happens to her body. However, they seem to be forgetting one key matter: does the baby not have a choice as to it's body? Some say that cancer is alive and that by killing it we are ending a life. However, cancer will never gain sentience; cancer will never learn; cancer will never go to school. Cancer is like a parasite, feeding off of the body and expanding until the body is dead.   I am completely for the use of the term 'fetus.' The excuse for the abortion is that the baby is not yet a baby, rather only a fetus. That is where they are wrong. A fetus is just as much a human as I am, it simply has not progressed to the point in life I which I have reached. Soon it shall be a baby, then it shall progress to toddlerhood, then to childhood, then to adolescence. It is not a baby, but it shall become one - just as an adolescent is not an adult, but it too shall become one.

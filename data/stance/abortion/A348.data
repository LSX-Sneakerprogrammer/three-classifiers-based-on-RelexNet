Here is what I think you are saying by potential life; This human after a certain point can go on and have a life. And by life I'm guessing you mean it in the generic sense, meaning the totality of ones existence, a life lived.   Here is why I think that is a dangerous position to hold. Basing the value of a human on it's potential is a subjective value judgment, someone other than the human in question decides the value of the human life. If someone decides that the life of someone else is not valuable they then are free to dispose of it. That's dangerous because that is how Germany began the road to the holocaust. It started with the sick, mentally retarded and elderly. The did it by making the value judgment that certain humans didn't have potential, they held no value for society. And following Darwin's model of survival of the fittest it was only logical to dispose of them. See potential is a very vague and subjective term that can be defined in a multitude of different ways, it's what's know as an equivocal word.   You see when a value judgment is subjective the line between value and no value can be easily moved to suite the desire of the one with power making every human at risk, even you.   The safer ground to stand on is objective value. The value of the human is in the human itself. By the fact that it is human gives it it's value. This puts all humans on a level playing field. I can't come up to you and because I have more power than you say your life is not as valuable as mine. Taking the position of objective value protects the weakest and most vulnerable members of the human race. We are not free to exploit them because we are more powerful.   I hope you see that by making this subjective value judgment of another human being you have raised yourself above them because you are more powerful. And now because of your power over them you can kill them freely, this is nothing short of the exploitation of the weakest and most vulnerable humans. Conscience ought to tell you that we should protect them, not exploit them.

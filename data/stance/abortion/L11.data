Oh, had I been aborted, I couldn't have imagined anything. But then your intellect should have provided you with your own answer.  Abortion is over very quickly indeed, and completely painless in the first trimester and a month and a bit after. The nervous system has not yet been totally formed; thus, according to medical literature, the zygote feels nothing.  Had I been aborted, I would have been spared the agony of dealing with hypocrites--the most prevalent and destructive types the human race has ever known.   I think the best piece of advice I could offer anyone is that they live the best possible life doing the least amount of harm. Although, having said that, if you really mean well to others, climb aboard the band wagon that's headed towards the non wholesale slaughter of human beings. Can you say, "WAR"?

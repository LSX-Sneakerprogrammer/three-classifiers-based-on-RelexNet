[What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts]  I believe Avasked said mistreatment counted as cruelty. Last I checked, mistreating someone includes murder and rape. Cruelty must involving hurting someone, physically or mentally. The fetus cannot think nor can feel.

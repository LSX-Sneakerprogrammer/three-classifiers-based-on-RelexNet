Just a little request: please use the bold feature for disputes, rather than listing points. To do so, type 2 asterisks, then your text, then close it with 2 asterisks, like using speech marks. It makes it easier to see exactly what you're disputing. Thanks.   Newborns are not independent of their natural host   I think it's quite obvious that once the umbilical cord is cut, it is independent of its host.    Left alone they will die of thirst.   Well, so will anything. I don't see what relevance this poses.    a fetus can become independent if it is given the time to mature into a child and then an adult.   Yes, but it isn't a fetus then. I'm not a 13 year old fetus. A fetus cannot survive independently until the third trimester, when abortion is illegal.    However most fetuses will be able to if given time (they grow into children and then adults)   See above.    You're looking at a fetus as a separate entity from a human, but it is just the beginning growth stage of a human.   But at this point, it's extremely difficult to say that it is truly human.    A fetus can do these things once it grows to be a child. Just as a child can do more things once it becomes an adult.   See my first point.   f this were the case, you'd be dead in a few hours. Your body is constantly reproducing cells to replace dying ones. Sexual reproduction is a very tiny, tiny percentage of the reproduction the human body is engaged in.   I do understand this. What I mean is, the way a human passes it's genes down is through sexual reproduction. A fetus cannot do this, thus scientifically, it is not fully human.    I have a friend who is asexual due to a birth defect where her womb never developed.   Firstly, I would like to say how little knowledge I have on this subject. So if I say anything stupid or offensive, it's nothing malicious, just ignorant.  OK, I'll accept that she is asexual. But she can't reproduce asexually, right? Meaning she has no reproductive capability. If she was able to reproduce, it would be sexually, not asexually? If so, my point still stands.   A fetus cannot sexually reproduce because it has not begun developing sexual organs yet (but it has the DNA plans to and is working on it)   I like that analogy. So I'll give my own spin.  A builder asks you if you want a new kitchen fitted for free. Obviously, you agree. You're very considerate and respectful to the builder, as he's doing it for free. You give him tea, coffee, breaks, all the perks he wants.A day later, you ask him how he's doing with the kitchen. He hands you the blueprints, and says, "I'm working on it."   I for one, would be seething if I had given that man perks for doing absolutely nothing builderly-like whatsoever. And I would also be incensed if I had to give full human rights to something that isn't human yet, just "working on it."   Newborns certainly don't have all the biological features of an adult - how does this affect their humanity?   A newborn is independent of its host. A fetus is not able to be until the third trimester.    Nay. It is not the baby's fault that the mother was raped, so she has no right to harm it.   But it's not the mother's fault she was raped. The rapist had no right to harm her. The difference between an adult woman and a fetus, is that the woman is, without a doubt, entitled to human rights. The right to choose what she does with her body. The fact that the fetus' rights are in doubt, lets the woman take precedent.    Nay. This is unfortunate, but if it is not life-or-death, how is there any justification in killing the baby?   The right to choose.    Nay. Again this is unfortunate, but how can we presume to know if the baby wants to live or not? If this were acceptable, the retarded, disfigured, and elderly people could be killed along the same line of reasoning.   I'll accept that one.   Nothing, read my response to this:   I must say, that was a very refreshing and innovative take on the question.

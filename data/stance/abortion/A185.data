great, another one.  I've read it. I've read it a million times on this lame debate alone. You're not saying anything new, there's no great revelation anywhere in your arguement.  None of what you say in any way points toward any kind of self-awareness. Science says it's not a baby, and nothing you said will stop a single abortion from happening.  So stop, find another cause. Abortions have been going on since the beginning of time and all this foaming-at-the-mouth zealous ignorance has never stopped a single one. Every time in history you zealous foaming-at-the-mouth looney tunes have gotten your way and made abortion illegal it has lead to nothing but a bunch of dead little girls from botched abortions, and still not a single abortion is ever stopped.  If  you  don't want an abortion,  you  don't have to get one. But if some poor young girl thinks that's her best option, then that's  her  choice.  If god or whoever doesn't like it, then he can come down here and tell her himself.  Stay out of it.

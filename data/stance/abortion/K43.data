And you think animals DO have souls? Your parents told you your pet puppy went to puppy heaven didn't they?  As for why you think anything you just said is relevant to the abortion debate... well, I'm mystified. But then most of your "arguments" leave me in a similar state so I'm getting used to it I think.

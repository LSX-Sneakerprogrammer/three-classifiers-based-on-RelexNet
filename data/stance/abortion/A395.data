"just because people will try to do something outside the law, doesn't mean the govt should just make it legal"...   are you suggesting that abortions are already "outside the law"? It's happening everywhere and it is everyone's rights to their own body. It's not outside the law unless you make it so!  Besides, making certain recreational drugs legal allow certain societies to control it better. This may be the case with abortions.

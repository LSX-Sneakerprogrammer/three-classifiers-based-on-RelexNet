of course not!! let me define the "real" abortion...  Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo.....  so... we just "remove" something unnecessary (well, although it will be a human nine months later..)   and then the word that we should discuss from this motion is "life"...  and embryo is not yet become a human which have a life...  embryo, still a part of pregnant woman , which synchronize by "placenta".... when we do abortion, we just remove that part..

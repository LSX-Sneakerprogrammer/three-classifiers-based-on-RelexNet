If you will admit that abortion is EVER the best course of action in a given situation, the you will have to also admit that by definition, abortion is not murder. Now since the killing of an unborn fetus is  sometimes  legally designated as murder, we could discuss when it is appropriately termed "abortion" and when it is appropriately termed "murder"  I can jump ahead and point out that in cases of "medical necessity" most people would agree that an abortion is not immoral. Now should the determination of medical necessity be a privately or publicly made decision? ie should a government agency have the authority to review a doctor/patient assessment of medical necessity?  Perhaps I've typed enough to spur some conversation.

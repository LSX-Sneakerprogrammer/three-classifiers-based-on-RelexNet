Criminal? LOL, I was invited to intern with the prosecutor's office.   And FYI, falsely alleging in print that someone is a criminal is called "libel" -- or if you want to be technical, "the  tort  of civil libel," meaning that I now have a cause of action to sue you if I like. (Ain't screenshots grand?) Congrats --  you  just crossed the line between what is merely rude and childish, and what is actually forbidden by law!  Please, by all means, go on making an ass of yourself. It's funny and it totally discredits your position so in effect I win twice . . .  :D  lolololololol

You do not get the point.  Laws are mutable...subject to change...and it varies...region to region...state to state...nation to nation.  Thus you cannot cite law to support an argument that is based on ethical considerations.  So yes if it pleases you let us assume I am Irish..or from a country that makes elective abortion illegal.   If the law changes, it still doesn't change that birth is a distinct and unambiguous process separating the foetus from the newborn (also, I am aware of cesarean section, I still consider this birthing).  In other words, law is simply an auxiliary, convenient bit.   So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least.   Apples provide seeds which are post-pollination. Besides that in biology there is asexual reproduction, which precludes the necessity for mating.   You cite various sources describing metabolic processes in fruit.  You are being disingenious..   No, I am acknowledging that apples are composed of living cells. Living cells take in and excrete waste.   We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms.   Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.   Except millions of innocent plant cells. Who will defend them? They are defenseless! Oh the humanity of it all!   I shall cite a reference for you...   Apples are not fruit according to the purely strict definition you provided, they are accessory fruits.   You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.   You keep throwing around that word "unique" as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome. Bananas are asexually propagated, they bear no seeds, so they share the same genome for all members of a cultivar.

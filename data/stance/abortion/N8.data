1. We're a self-aware, feeling cluster of cells. But a fetus does not equate mental retardation. It would more accurately compare to moss, or perhaps a very stupid lady bug.  2. I'm glad we agree here at least. But from where will the doctors come to perform this life saving surgery should it be all but illegal? It seems they would be hard to find after this puritanical cleansing.  3. It is about force, actually, being as it has been established well that abortion is not murder. It is the force of a belief system, and a faulty one at that.  4. Ah, so it is not about saving lives, it is about righteous revenge. I always suspected as much.  5. Seems we've been over this point a couple times now. Abortion is not murder.

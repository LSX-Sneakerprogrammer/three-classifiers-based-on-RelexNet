YES! EXACTLY! THANK YOU!  Victims of sexual crimes which result in unwanted pregnancy should be afforded the option to abort, but only as a FINAL solution.  And the only other exception would be when birth endangers the life of the mother, but of course, THAT decision would be left to the woman whose life is in danger.  Abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control.  My thoughts exactly. Thank you!

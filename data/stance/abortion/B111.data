Actually: I came up with my opinions of Abortion without the help of religion. I researched the topic independently, and tried to learn every angle that I could from BOTH sides. I'm pro-life in the definition of I think that every person should have equal opportunity to live, and that people should give the life as much chance to live as possible.  I think abortions that are NOT based on betterment for the woman or baby's health is wrong.   Why should eliminating someone's chance at life be an option just because it's CONVENIENT for the woman?  I care about all people in general having the chance to life their life to the fullest.  Not what people in the Bible said about it.  And abortion only prevents a child from being a 'bother' to their parents (unless it's for medical reasons). The parents decided to have sex knowing FULL WELL that they had the risk of having a child. But once they are met with the result of sex they want to bail out because they don't want to be inconvenienced with something THEY MADE.  If people are going to choose to do something, they need to take responsibility for their actions.

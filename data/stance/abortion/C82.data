Abortion is horrible. It disgusts me. Why are people so selfish that they would take a life? Does no one care about the miracle of life anymore? Even if a person doesn't want the baby, put it up for adoption! There are many women who are barren, and this give that child, not "Fetus", but PERSON a chance!

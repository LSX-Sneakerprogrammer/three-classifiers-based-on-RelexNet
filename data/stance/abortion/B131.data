But you are siding with the side that is pro-abortion. The child in the womb is never at fault, never deserves to be dismembered alive. It does not matter what excuse you can come up with...the unborn does not deserve it. But people like you side against life for reasons that YOU THINK are good enough for it to be killed.   You advocate death for the child of the mother who is mentally imbalanced. You said she might damage her baby should she be allowed to continue the pregnancy. You care more about the "what if's" than what actually might happen. What do you think abortion is? Why not take the chance that she might not harm the baby? You want to kill it by abortion anyway...this is a violent act.   What difference does it make whether she harms it or someone is hired to kill it? It dies in both scenarios?   A woman does have a choice. Allow the unborn a chance at life by doing what is right, or kill it and be responsible for ending anothers life because of selfish reasons, which is morally wrong.

Did you forget the following examples?  Hosea 13:16 (King James Version)  16Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.  Numbers 31:15-18 (King James Version)  15And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?  16Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.  17Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.  18But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.  Hosea 9:11-17 (King James Version)  11As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.  12Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!  13Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  14Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.  15All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.  16Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.  17My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.  Judges 11:30-40 (King James Version)  30And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,  31Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.  32So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.  33And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.  34And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.  35And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.  36And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.  37And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.  38And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.  39And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,  40That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.  2 Kings 2:23-24 (King James Version)  23And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.  24And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.  1 Samuel 15:2-3 (King James Version)  2Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.  3Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

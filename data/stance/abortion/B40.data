I respectfully think you are wrong.  Hiking is not dangerous really....mountain climbing on the other hand is. You take risks to do it. This is taking responsiblity for your actions...even if the risks you took backfired and became reality. And this is the case for intercourse between a man and a woman. THE RISK IS ALWAYS THERE....unless the woman or the man is sterile. If a woman has sexual intercourse with a man who was wearing protection....and that protection broke....how do you think she would feel? Anxious? Worried? If a woman who takes the pill had sex with a man...and later learned she forget to take one the day before...how would she feel? Worried? Sure she would....because mistakes happen...but that does not change the risk factor that she took. The risk was there...and human error, condom malfunctions can happen. How is that the fault of the new life they both created? It is unfortunate, but nevertheless, the life got started.   I dont think it should be individual opinion....it should be what the facts state. And it is a fact that at conception that which is living in the womb is a human being. Now its small, but that does not change its state. A little ant working hard on a hill....has all it needs to live....its small...but the workings of his bodily system works. And a fetus however small...has the same qualities...but is human. The heart starts at around twenty days...and every day grows and something develops. The issue is...does anyone have the right to kill a living human being without its concent. We have people here who are against killing animals for food, but they are pro-abortion and believe killing humans is obviously more moral. Figure that one out.   If you say they are responsible..is the responsible thing to do is kill it? How responsible is that? Do you think that two wrongs make a right?   You say there should be no laws to enslave the woman, that she should NOT be forced to carry a baby to full term. That means in your statement that you also would condone abortion in the ninth month. So don't come back and say........"ooops...now I don't mean that...only until its viable.." And gee when is viablity and what does that matter....the woman does not want it...and by your own statement should be allow to kill it whenever she wants. Anythink less as i said would enslave her and FORCE HER TO DO WHAT YOU SAY, NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO...in this case our government. How humane is your statement really? Donating blood does not kill anyone.   And in the United States we can really force people to give blood. When someone is arrested for drunk driving...most often they have to give blood. Denying it would really be an admission of guilt and the arresting officer can use it as evidence.  I don't get that you think its immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over their childs, yet believe the mother can kill her child while it is in the womb. ????????  Yours is certainly not the Republican stance thats for sure.

Looking at the world in black and white with complete disregard for reality is intelectually lazy, and I'm not at all shy to say it. The world is complicated, and when you look at it through an uncompromising moralistic lense you end up oversimplifying problems and giving simplistic answers. Calling abortion murder is simplistic and misses the point of the debate. I am doing my best to discuss the issue as rationally as possible but when you make statements like  Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged  it makes it really difficult to continue.  Of course no one wants to get an abortion. Whether you believe it to be murder or not, it's still a sad event and you'd have to be heartless not to feel something. What I am arguing is that banning abortion is not the best way to reduce the suffering that unwanted pregancies causes. Instead we should concentrate on improving sex education, and helping increase the standard of living of the poor (a group that is disproportionately more likely to have unwanted pregancies and get abortions). I know this is difficult for you to understand on your moral high horse, but stop and consider that there might be more to the issue then the oversimplified version that has been hammered into your thick little skull since birth.  I'm sorry but a single cell's rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do not trump the right a woman to choose whether or not she wants to be a mother. We are talking about something that doesn't exist as a thinking feeling human being, and I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.   The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be a mother's womb   I agree, and that's why I said that a viable fetus should be considered a full human being, however you choose again and again to ignore this fact.

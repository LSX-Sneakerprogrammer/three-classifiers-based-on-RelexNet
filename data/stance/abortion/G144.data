Of course not. Pro-choice doesn't mean forcing every pregnant woman to get an abortion. Every pro-lifer seems to have deluded themselves into believing so. Pro-life means forcing every pregnant woman to have her baby even if she doesn't want it. There are plenty of women out there who want to have children. But if it's just some teen who got screwed over (No pun intended (Just kidding. Pun totally intended)) and she isn't ready to take on a child, especially since her boyfriend is likely to desert her after finding out she's pregnant or if it was just a one night thing between two strangers, she should be aloud to get rid of that extra conglomeration of cells (since that's all it is) and go on with her life. There's no need to change your life for one kid you don't even want. Besides, the fetus can be used for it's stem cells.

I'll be more blunt. It isn't your responsibility to teach others moral lessons that involve contracting fatal diseases, or ruining their lives. Such behaviour is vindictive and arrogant.   That is your subjective opinion, I on the other hand disagree.  I think my 'lesson' is entirely valid...personal responsibility is very important.   It isn't arbitrary. It aligns with law.   What law, of which nation?  Besides laws can be changed.   Being against killing isn't much of an argument. We kill every day. As far as I and anyone who has ever looked at a foetus is concerned, killing a foetus is little different from killing an Apple when you made cider.   Utterly ridiculous.  An apple is a fruit and is not a multi cellular organism, such as a human foetus.  I do not kill human foetuses everyday and that is what we are discussing..not apples or plums or oranges...LOL

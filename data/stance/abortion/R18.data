Pregnancy is a pain in the ass   I would be willing to go through tremendous pangs to save a life, as would many others. Why else do soldiers get injured/killed trying to save people from minefields?   Childbirth is dangerous    Just how often to mothers die during childbirth now-a-days?   If she goes through with the pregnancy she will have a human being she will be obligated to care for.   Two answers to that:  Put the baby up for adoption.  Leave the baby at a firestation.   If you could somehow turn every speck of dust into a human being, then every speck of dust could be considered potential life.    Potential life? A fetus is alive, regardless of how developed it is. That alone should give it more rights than some damn speck of dust!

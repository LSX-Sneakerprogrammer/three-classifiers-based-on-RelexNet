That's not what I said. Typical... turning my words into something they are not. How polite of you. What I said is that neutrality is logical because this world is made of almost nothing but it. If you kill a man who attacks you for no discernible reason, how good or evil is that action if he is a devoted, loving father? The fact is that there is little good and evil in the world, something that churchmouse did not seem to understand, thus my explanation of it and neutrality to her.  What you don't understand is that to be neutral isn't to not make a decision. To be neutral is to be aligned in between two extremes. Just because you are aligned in between two extremes does not mean you do not make decisions based off of your alignment. You're not thinking of neutrality, you are thinking of laziness. Or stupidity, perhaps. And for the record, you don't know how I treat my own children. How I treat them has nothing to do with abortion, nor my point on neutrality.   You are correct, you did make an argument of logic, though what you forgot to include in said argument was a wide variety of points that prove that abortion are wrong. If you are saying that abortion is wrong only because it stops people from facing the consequences of unprotected sex, then you are forgetting that there are  far  too many reasons for and against abortion for that to be your leading point.

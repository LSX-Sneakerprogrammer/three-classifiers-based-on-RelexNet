Abortion is a really common thing nowaday and not a lot of people seem to be bothered by that idea, just because of how usual it has become.   I have an "against" point of view, just because I don't think that abortion is an exit from a situation whe you are pregnant, it can not be that easy. Before a girl should think about things to prevent unwanted pregnancy. There are a lot of pills, birthcontrols and some kind of technological equipments which may help without harming young girl's organism. Secondly I don't find it morally impoverished. It's basically a murder. Just think of it! Every day there are a lot of embryos thrown into huge garbage bins. Those were supposed t be future children and just because of silly "parents" they weren't given a chance to live. I don't know, maybe time passes by and I'll understand it sometime, someday, but not right now. For now it's something that gives me a big feeling of disgust.

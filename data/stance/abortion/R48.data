Also, why is it always the atheist, the vegetarian, the liberal, and all the left wing guys make such a moral issue out of it?  It's the way life is and always has been and always will be.  I only see the people who agree with backward beliefs the ones making moral issues out of them NOT people who don't believe in it.

In no situation, aside from health problems leading to the death of the mother and child, should abortion ever become an option. If you are not ready to be a mother, you didn't plan for it, etc., it's still not an option. Would you go out and murder someone walking down the street? So why would you ever kill an innocent, unborn human? Especially one that is half of you? Even if rape is involved, would you murder an innocent neighbor child because you were raped? Think of how your life would be different if even one person you know had never existed: multiply that by hundreds of thousands. More people have been killed by abortions (in the US only) in the past six years than Jews died in the Holocaust (there are app. 1.37 mil each year). By this time tomorrow, app. 3,700 more babies will be dead. I truly am sorry if it was a mistake, if the mother's not ready, even if there was rape involved. But that is still no reason to take a human life! I am fourteen (yes, fourteen), and I would not do it! Never would it even cross my mind! Only God can create life; only He should take it away. You wouldn't kill your family, you wouldn't kill a friend, you wouldnt kill a child (or anyone!) on the street, why in the Hell (literally!!!) would you kill an innocent baby, especially your own?  by the way, the statistics in this argument are taken from &gt;http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/                                        fastfacts.html&lt;.

Abortion should NOT be legal. There are countless women in this world that can't have children or are struggling to concieve...women should deliver the babies - and allow the child to live a life. Just because 2 adults are not ready to care for a child doesn't mean that abortion is the only option.   As a mother, I know how much joy my son has brought me...and believe me - if there is a woman out there that doesn't want their child - there are equally as many women out there that are dying to have one. Allow your child to be loved if not by you, then by another family.

//Personally, I don't think abortion should be allowed anywhere. //  Right, that's why you should try and find a way to prevent this from happening naturally, since up to 70% of fertilised eggs are naturally aborted from the body. Good luck with that.  //The mother always has choices readily available to them//  There are only to choices when faced with an unintended pregnancy - to remain or not remain pregnant. Adoption is an acceptable solution for an unwanted child, but does nothing for the woman who does not want to remain pregnant.  //I think that for those who consider an abortion, they shouldn't have opened their legs in the first place, whether the guy was wearing a glove or not. //  Ah, so it's the dirty woman's fault for having sex even though she used contraceptives to prevent it? Give it up, this argument is all fail when: 1) Sex directly results in depositing sperm into the vagina, NOT instant pregnancy or "baby"; 2) Fertilisation can occur outside of the body without any sexual activity.  //Unless there was a life-or-death situation where the mother could die with a c-section or die having a baby. then it's appropriate.//  Ah, so you are pro-choice after all, yes?

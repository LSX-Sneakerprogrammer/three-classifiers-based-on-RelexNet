Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion. By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.   First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.   But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.

It's a moving story, yes. However the boy is now a life! Before it became a life, it was only a potential life attached to its mother and is completely dependent on her. Only she should have the say in whether it should be kept or not. I am pro-choice, so I say give the women who are considering abortion as much counselling and options and information as you can, but before the fetus can survive outside of her womb it's her choice and society should not make her do anything she doesn't want to do.

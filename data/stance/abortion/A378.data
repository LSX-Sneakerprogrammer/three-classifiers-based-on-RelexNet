Actually, you're wrong.  By that I refer to your statement of: "If you were aborted, you wouldn't be here right now. But that means nothing!"  One man makes a difference, and yes, this can and does affect the world.  Man is the most dominant species on Earth, as I'm sure you would agree, and it is because of this that certain choices of ours greatly impacts the planet. Greenhouse gases is one example, Nuclear War is another. To be honest, there are many things I have done that have affected the world, all of which relate to Greenhouse Gas emissions and preventions.  Anyway, my point is that one man makes a difference, whether we are born or not makes a difference. The level of difference varies, as all men/women are not created equal.  It shouldn't be a choice of do we come into this world, but should be what we will do with the time we have while we are here.

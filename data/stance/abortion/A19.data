A fetus is a stage of development. The genes are what determines what kind of fetus it is. So when a human being has an abortion she takes the life of a human fetus, not the fetus of a dog or cat, a human fetus. About the condom. Using a condom is what you do before fertilization to try and prevent fertilization. An abortion is what you do after fertilization has occurred to stop further growth of the product of fertilization. And when done on humans it ends the life of a human in the early stages of development. Them are the facts; abortions on humans ends the life of a human, using condoms prevents the fertilization of the human sperm and egg.

I am antichoice abortion. I am also antichoice drugs…and rape….and child pornography. You can also add..anti selling body parts,selling organs also abortion for the purpose of selling fetal body parts. All these are laws that prohibit people from doing things that most would not hurt anyone else. But we still have them on the books.  are you pro-on all of these?   If not then you enslave someone from doing something with their body. So you are anti-choice. So why do you fault me for being antichoice abortion?  I believe that science established the fact that the life in the womb is a separate human being from its mother. It does not share organs…does not have the same finger prints…etc. It is simply using the space to grow. It did not ask to be there it was invited by its mother. It was her body also that invited the sperm into the space where conception took place. She is the one who knew what could happen….when she had sex. She took the risk. She should be responsible for what happens. It was her risk and fault…not the unborns.   I am forced everyday to do things I don't want to do. I hate seat belts…but I am forced by law to wear them. And texting in the car. Who should have the right to stop someone from doing this if they are careful. Its their phone…its their car. THEY TAKE THE RISK JUST LIKE THE WOMAN DOES WHEN SHE HAS SEX. We all live by rules many we don't like. I do not like abortion.  I do not fail to see anything…I see things crystal clear. Anyone that opposes protection for the unborn is pro-abortion. Pro in the sense THEY WANT ABORTION LEGAL….WHICH MEANS BABIES DIE. That is not pro-life…even if they would never get one themselves. I go to conventions and seminars with Right to Life. If you stood up and said….."I am pro-choice but I am against abortion"…you would be laughed out of the room. It simply can not be.  Can you be pro-choice and sit back and allow your neighbor to abuse his children? Could you have been pro-choice and allowed slaves like they did in the South? Could you have been pro-choice and turn your head at what Hitler did to those he marched into the ovens?  I am not happy. I am not happy with positions here because they are barbaric and cruel and cold. For me its like looking into the eyes of evil.  Debate is a way of changing hearts as well if someone is open enough to examine their position. Try it…..

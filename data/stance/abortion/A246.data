As I said, some debates have much stronger arguments to one side.   1 is not 4.    I agree. If both numbers refer to the same kind of thing, 1 is not 4. 1 banana is not 4 bananas. One could argue that, if it's not specified, 1 could be 4... For example, 1 family might have exactly 4 people in it. In this case, 1 (family) is 4 (people). But if the numbers are just shown without "units", it's usually implied that they are probably referring to the same thing. Therefore, 1 is not 4.   If you have your arguments in order, every issue is debatable. It's just that some are closer to a consensus than others...

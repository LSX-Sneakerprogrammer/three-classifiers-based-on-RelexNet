Since you haven't disputed my other arguments on the other end, I shall simply respond to this one.   If having a child would be burden, then having sex is a terrible idea.   Which says absolutely nothing about abortion is morally right or wrong.   Sex is intentional.   Obviously, sex involves two parties. Thus, your idea of whether sex is intentional or not would depend on whose perspective you are taking.   In nature, it is meant to result in fertilization. It is not an "accident," it is what is supposed to happen.   Again, you are misconstruing what can be considered an "accident". Just because it occurs "in nature" doesn't mean that it is not an accident. An earthquake could be natural. And it could be natural for buildings to collapse during an earthquake event. It could even be that the debris of the collapsing buildings kill people and cause other loss of property. However, does it necessarily mean that it is not an accident.

Jeesh, why are all you pro-lifers on this debate so incredibly dense?  You completely missed the point of my billions of sperm argument.  I was shooting down a specific argument in the pro-holier-than-now-I-refuse-to-mind-my-                                        own-business  arsenal.  And that is the dramatically flawed  potential  life argument.  The only argument pro-life has is that the cluster of cells is alive.  Okay fine, I'm through arguing that. You guys think you know more than science so obviously I'm not going to convince you otherwise.  What I  can  argue though is that  if  the tragedy here is the  potential  life lost. Then it is logically irrefutable that lost sperm is just as tragic.  Therefore, masturbation should be illegal, sex with your wife if she is barren should be illegal, sex if you're shooting blanks should be illegal, wet dreams should be illegal, etc.  Regardless of the numbers involved, a potential life is still a potential life.  So logically, if abortion is banned, so should (by pro-lifer logic even) all those things listed.  There's no way for you to escape that. Not that your arguments have ever been bound by logic thus far.

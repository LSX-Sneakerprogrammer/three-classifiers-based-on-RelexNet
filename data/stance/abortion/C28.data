Yes personal responsibility is a terrible thing...something we should never expect of anyone...   I'll be more blunt. It isn't your responsibility to teach others moral lessons that involve contracting fatal diseases, or ruining their lives. Such behaviour is vindictive and arrogant.   How subjectively arbitrary, you think your opinion here gives weight to your argument? Interesting.   It isn't arbitrary. It aligns with law.   Semantics, depends which nation you live in.  OK Abortion is killing, pure and simple...  Have I seen a foetus?  What a stupid question...what relevance is that?   Being against killing isn't much of an argument. We kill every day. As far as I and anyone who has ever looked at a foetus is concerned, killing a foetus is little different from killing an Apple when you made cider.

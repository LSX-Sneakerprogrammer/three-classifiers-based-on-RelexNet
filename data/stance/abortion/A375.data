Let me get this straight; you are suggesting that there should be a yes/no policy on every aspect on life?  If I choose not to pay my taxes, I am fined and jailed.  If I choose to kill, I am also jailed.  If I choose to ignore the Stop Signs while driving, I could cause several kinds of accidents.  If I choose to disobey the law, I am a criminal.  Have a think about where I am going with this. While you're at it, add to the list, see how far you get before you realize how wrong your statement was.

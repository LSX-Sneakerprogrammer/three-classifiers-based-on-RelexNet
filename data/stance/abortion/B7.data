What I just said is fact like it or not. You want to say that abortion should be legal because its her body...her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK. You look silly. Our laws say that the baby is not his enough to be a part of the decision...he has no choice in the matter. Why men don't see this and storm in outrage I don't know. Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is.   You are cold. But then you respresent death to innocent human beings because you are a pro-abort. You champion killing. And that is what abortion is...whether its in the first month...or ninth, its killing. The abortionists goal isnt to shoot a documentary, or catch a fish, or play a round of golf.......it is to KILL THAT WHICH IS IN THE WOMANS WOMB. It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.  You're a typical pro-abort all over the place, not consistent at all. Sigh  If a child is gonna make her life awful...kill it. LMAO So compassionate of you.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe...  You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on.   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on........LOL  Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.  You are saying death should always be an option. How do you go to bat for the innocent in the womb? You don't.  You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed. Do you ever read what you post here and really really think about what you say and how it sounds. YOU YOU YOU....think   What do YOU think any aborted child in the womb would say if they could talk (hell infant babies cant talk either) and address the one who killed them, the one who presumed they would have a horrible life?   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing. LOL  You pro-aborts kill me....no pun intended.  What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.  You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved) but that it shouldnt be her responsiblity only........(what the man should pay for the killing?) you think when the baby can feel pain abortion should not be allowed.... not allowed...after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.  I know the studies...I know people who have done the studies. The fact is....that which is in the womb is human, is alive and is a growing person. Science is on the side of life and defines it in terms that are not pro-choice. Life was not concieved to kill in this way, it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb.

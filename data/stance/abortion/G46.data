Then why are you even debating a topic that you fail to research on? Legal rulings has nothing to do with politics. If that was the case then why is political science different from law. Laws are formed out of the decisions made by politicians i agree but at the same time amendments to the laws are also made by the supreme court as well. Whether you are dealing with science or business etc at some point you will have to abide by the instructions of the laws.  And again debating my friend is based on facts and research not just what you think.

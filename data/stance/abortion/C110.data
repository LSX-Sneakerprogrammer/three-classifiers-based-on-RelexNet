You're cap lock is on. ;)  It isn't my body and it isn't your body, therefore you have the right to tell her what she can and can't do with it?   yeah, that's a rock-solid argument, you ego-centric hypocritical fool.   If God doesn't want abortions to happen then why are there so many still-births? Why does God abort so many of his own children is he finds it immoral? Is God a hypocrite too? (rhetorical)

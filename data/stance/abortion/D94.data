Yes but we don't know if that unborn life could become somebody like Albert Einstein etc but it also could become a Hitler, osama bin laden and countless others. It's chance, we don't know who the unborn will become.   Government should not place restrictions on what a female can do with to her body, because of a chance. Many people die before they have a chance to become somebody like Albert Einstein yet the evidence of their path is there to see, but the government and others don't worry about trying to preserve their life, just the life of a chance which could go any number of ways.

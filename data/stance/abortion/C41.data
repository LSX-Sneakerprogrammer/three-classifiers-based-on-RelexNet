I repeat!  Plants do not have central nervous systems...foetuses do.    http://ds9.botanik.uni-bonn.de/zellbio/ AG-Baluska-Volkmann/plantneuro/ neuroview.php     Brain waves have been recorded by EEG (electro- encephalograph) in the human embryo 40 days after fertilisation   But not a mind... this is what I was arguing against.

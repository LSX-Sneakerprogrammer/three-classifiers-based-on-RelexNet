Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortion…there is no difference. They don't like the label however but its the truth. I just got banned from a place because I refused to stop using the term pro-abort to describe someone who …DOES NOT WANT LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE LIVING HUMAN BEING IN THE WOMB. This is not a pro-life person. This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselves…is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE.   THEY ARE PRO-ABORTS. I can just see someone at a Right to Life convention…standing up and saying…." I am pro-life but believe that women should have the choice to kill." They would be laughed out of the room.  There is no difference between someone who is pro-abortion and someone who is pro-choice…they want the same thing….legalized killing.   Cutting off a piece of skin….compared to stopping a beating heart of a human in the womb…..you think is the same thing? Laughable…won't even comment.  You probably no doubt think that killing a bug is the same as killing a human being….hey they are both alive right?  Yes babies are costly. How much did your parents foot the bill for your maintenance? At least your mother allowed you life…and you are here debating and defending the rights of other mothers…to kill, to take away the rights of others. What is it that Ronald Reagan said…it was so true.  “Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.”  Question….I know you are pro-abortion. Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months? Oh I can't wait to see just how many rights you give women….to own their bodies.   Why is abortion bad you ask?   You said and I quote…."I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice."  What is wrong with owning the label? You tell me what is wrong with being called pro-abortion? Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?  If there is…then why do you support it? If there isn't…why isn't the label ok?   LOL

Err on the side of life? ERR??? This is not guess work. The fact is we DO know that it's human, we DO know that it's definitely a POTENTIAL life (but not ACTUAL life). We DO know the answer to most of these questions. We just want a choice. Don't word it as if you've sanctioned abortions. You are simply giving people a choice. Put it another way, you haven't taken away their rights to choose.   Holocaust is killing Jews.   Choice to abort a fetus that cannot survive outside the womb until at least week 20 is the same as using a condom or abstaining, or masterbating into the toilet.

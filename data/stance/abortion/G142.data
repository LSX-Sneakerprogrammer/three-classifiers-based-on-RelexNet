[If you are saying that because we believe abortion is wrong then we are taking the rights of Americans then what about the rights of the child as a developing human too?]  Isn't that an American too?Its not an American till it's born.   [So my answer to you is should we pay rapists not to commit rapes and cause unwanted pregnancies too?]  No, they should pay. Them causing unwanted pregnancies is just as bad as people that would deny a woman an abortion. People taking away the right to have an abortion. Screw the "morals" your thinking about. You are trying to take away someone's right. That's another common thing with gun control, people are trying to take away other people's rights. You are taking the rights of the citizens of America. You sir, are the kind of people who send our country down the drain.

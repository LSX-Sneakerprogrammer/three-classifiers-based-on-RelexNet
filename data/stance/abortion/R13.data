There are good people of good conscience on both sides of this argument. Isn't that a great indication that the government should butt out and let people make their own decision based on their own beliefs?  We on the pro-choice side are content to let anti-abortion people who are faced with unwanted pregnancy decide what they will do based on their own beliefs.   We think you should be free to live your lives according to your beliefs. We think we should too.

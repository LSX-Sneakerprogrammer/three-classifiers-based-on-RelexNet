But who is to say the child may not grow up to be the next Stephen Hawking, or even just a stable, healthy individual. Yes, there is also a chance that they would have a horrible life. But by killing the fetus, you remove ANY chance at all. It would be like the staff on the Titanic walking through the ship and killing every passenger aboard, rather than giving them a chance in the lifeboats or even in the open water (6 survived in the water by the way......Bet they were glad they were given the chance.)

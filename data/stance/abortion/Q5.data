A fetus is NOT a human, just a massï»¿ of tissue   By that definition, so you are you. So am I.   Abortion is safer than childbirth   HA! In the same way that murder is safer than living.   The number of abortions are relatively small   The number of murders are relatively small. Should we no legalize murder, rape, and theft?   Nobody has the right to impose their morals on others   Then why do we have laws against murder? child rape? torture? assault? grand larceny? etc.?   A woman should be able to control her own body   To say that a fetus is merely an extension of its parent needs some substantiation.   Abortion must be kept legal, especially for all the rape and incest pregnancies   Fair enough.   If abortion is outlawed women will be forced to go to back-alley abortion clinics   Should this have a bearing on its endorsement as legal by the state?   Aborting an unwanted fetus reduces the number of abused children   HA! In the same way that mass genocide prevents accidental deaths.

Any Federal law on abortion is inherently illegal because the Federal government has no authority to regulate abortion. The States individually have the power to. I would be ecstatic if every State in the Union outlawed abortion, just like murder is outlawed.     Abortion isn't murder. A foetus is not a person in the meaningful sense of the word.

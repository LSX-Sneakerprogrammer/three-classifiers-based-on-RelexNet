You could argue that a human being is a composite of billions of animals working together...so what?   It is a commentary on your statement.   How does that prove that a foetus is no more special than a Plum?   Without an identity it is as generic.   A foetus is human...a Plum is not.   So? This isn't a comment of any use. It's accepted that a human is not a plum.

Ok, before you go around saying having an abortion = killing "somebody" consider this:  does a pregnant woman need a passport for her belly when she travels? Does the fetus inside of her know anything? Can it make any decisions? What kind of a "person" is it? IT'S NOT A PERSON!  Before it can survive outside of its mother's womb, it is not society's choice but the mother's choice. Don't take that choice away from the mother.

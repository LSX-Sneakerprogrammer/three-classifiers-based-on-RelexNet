I'm not saying that we should abort babies because one of them might become like Hitler or Stalin or someone else bad, i'm just saying that if you are gonna use the argument that not aborting a baby might produce a genius then you have to take into account that not aborting that baby could also produce a very evil person. It goes both ways. of course i'm not saying my reasoning would require that every baby be killed, i believe the woman has the final choice so i couldn't decide if the baby is aborted or not i could just suggest.

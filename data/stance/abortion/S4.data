i believe that abortion should be legal because all an abortion is, is preventing a baby from being born into the world. if thats the case, then what are we doing by using birth control or condoms. we are preventing a baby from being born into the world. its also the mother's choice, and the father if hes still around. and what about those who are raped and unfortunate with a baby of that specific person.

The question is not what makes us a person. The question is; what is it?  Genetics tells us that it is human, although in the early stages of development.   An embryo cannot think, feel, see, hear, remember, or do any of the other things that distinguish us as people   This argument had some weight before the ultrasound. But in this day and age with 3D and 4D imagining it is simply naive.   But let's say your right and we don't know at what point the unborn embryo/fetus gains the rights of a full grown person. Why not err on the side of life? If we don't know it would seem wise to use caution and restraint. Therefore to allow abortion on demand would be the height of folly.  So in conclusion; if we don't know when a fetus becomes a person we should ban abortion because it might take the life of a person.

I will take the bait for fun.  I assume (unless you refute it explicitly) you agree that there are  some cases where abortion is merited or "medically necessary"  Who is the proper authority for determining medical necessity?  expected answer from you (according to the way I think you think):Government  Answer I would give: The doctor and those consulted by the pregnant woman.  Abortion is not banned. The murder of the unborn  is  illegal and punishable as murder. Abortion is not murder if you admit that it is  ever  done by medical necessity and without malicious intent.  since this argument is flawless, all who disagree are just plain old sloppy thinkers ~sarcastic snicker

What happens if the mother is raped? Could you ask her to live with the offspring of a obviously demented rapist. Being a mother is hard enough to add that to it as well. What if the child in the womb is damaged or deficient beyond help. A young mother that is duped and lied to by some swaggering Lothario that walks out and leaves her with the child. There are many situations under which you are completely wrong. People need to take responsibility for the amount of children being born into broken homes and poverty. Poverty breeds just look at the street children in calcutta or the child soldiers in Sierra Leone a lot of this stems from religious belief as religion, lack of education and poverty all go hand in hand.

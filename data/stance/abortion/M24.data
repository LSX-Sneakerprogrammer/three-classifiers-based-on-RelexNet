its still taking nourishment from the mother, it still moves. I am a mom, do you know how i would feel now(after holding her) if i would've taken the alternative route?   If its taking nourishment from its mother, it's not quite a human being yet. If it has a brain, that makes the issue more complex.  Childbirth was a decision that you took, it worked for you. You need to understand that what works for doesn't work for many women.

Even if it was.   You sound sceptical. Why?   Your statement was rude and counterproductive.   I think it was harsh, not rude. But maybe we have a different threshold for rudeness. I don't think it was counter-productive. It certainly got your attention. However, if we were going to enter into such a petty debate, it would indeed be counterproductive.   No it takes into account that most abortions are not due to medical necessity.   This is argumentum ad populum. Even if this  was  true, it doesn't necessarily mean that abortion  ought  not to be legal.   Because you offered your scathing critique of Silaswash's writing style and left your response absent of anything that would give a clue as to your perspective regarding the subject being discussed.   Ah, but what a decent person does is ask for clarification, isn't it?   I didn't claim they all were.   You didn't say they weren't. All you asserted was that abortion is an unnecessary surgery.   Well they are certainly not given a burial   So what? A child could be killed by a parent through abuse and still be given a proper. In such a case, does it mean that just because the child was given a proper burial it necessarily meant that he/she wasn't treated like trash?

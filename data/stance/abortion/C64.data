Abortion is not okay. It is the destruction of a defenceless and innocent human life. Despite the occasional case of a woman's life being at risk, the overwhelming majority of abortions are not in such cases.  We would not allow the killing of a two-year-old, a two-month-old, even a two-hour-old in any comparable situation. The fact that the child is unborn makes no difference to the morality of the action.

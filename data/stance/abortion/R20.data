Regardless of whether it is fully developed, it surely shall become so soon. Just think, thirty years ago (or however old you are), you mother may have decided to abort you. You are saying that it would be her choice, but would you have opted for it? It is not her life, it is yours. Wouldn't you rather be alive? How about the millions of others who have been aborted over the years. Why don't they have a say in the matter?

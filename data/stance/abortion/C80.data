Month one  Mommy  I am only 8 inches long  but I have all my organs.  I love the sound of your voice.  Every time I hear it  I wave my arms and legs.  The sound of your heart beat  is my favorite lullaby.  Month Two  Mommy  today I learned how to suck my thumb.  If you could see me  you could definitely tell that I am a baby.  I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though.  It is so nice and warm in here.  Month Three  You know what Mommy  I'm a boy / girl!  I hope that makes you happy.  I always want you to be happy.  I don't like it when you cry.  You sound so sad.  It makes me sad too  and I cry with you even though  you can't hear me.  Month Four  Mommy  my hair is starting to grow.  It is very short and fine, but i will have a lot of it  I spend a lot of my time exercising.  I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes  and stretch my arms and legs.  I am becoming quite good at it too.  Month Five  You went to the doctor today.  Mommy, he lied to you.  He said that I'm not a baby.  I am a baby Mommy, your baby.  I think and feel.  Mommy, what's abortion?  Month Six  I can hear that doctor again.  I don't like him.  He seems cold and heartless.  Something is intruding my home.  The doctor called it a needle.  Mommy what is it? It burns!  Please make him stop!  I can't get away from it!  Mommy! HELP me!  Month Seven  Mommy  I am okay.  I am in Death's arms.  He is holding me.  He told me about abortion.  Why didn't you want me Mommy?  Every Abortion Is Just . . .  One more heart that was stopped.  Two more eyes that will never see.  Two more hands that will never touch.  Two more legs that will never run.  One more mouth that will never speak.  Did you know that by day 30 you had a heart?  Did you know that by day 42 that that your brain ordered your heart to start beating if it hadn't given the order already?  I bet that you didn't know that if there is brain activity doctors consider a patient alive and has the right to continue living  Life starts at the moment of conception and abortion is therefore immoral, wrong and a waste of time

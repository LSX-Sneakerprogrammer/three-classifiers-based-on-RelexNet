The Laws have a rigght to infringe upon the body of anyone in order to control criminal activity especially since it was created by the majority of the people of this land.   To quote you, who cares what is legal and not legal? Laws change all the time. I do not consider it a criminal activity for a woman to choose to have sex in exchange for money; I consider it another example of religious moral being passed into law. However, this is a different debate topic.    I don't want to hear your reason. I need you to produce evidence pointing that the fetus is indeed a parasite. What is your opinion is your opinion but that does not mean you are correct. Everybody knows what a parasitic realtionship is but there is a deeper relationship here in which several elements of science were combined to provide a deeper scientific relationship.   Okay. I am going to try one more time to explain to you in simple terms why the mother-fetus relationship is parasitic. This is the last time I am going to try to explain it. If you do not understand after this, I will not address the point again; this does not mean I am assuming I am correct by virtue of ending the argument, just that I have thoroughly exhausted all the evidence there is, only to have it ignored by you, and I am not longer going to waste time on it.  When two organisms interact on a biological level, they enter a symbiotic relationship. This relationship can be mutual, commensal, or parasitic. Mutual relationships are relationships in which both organisms involved reap a benefit. Commensal relationships are relationships in which one organism benefits, and the other is not affected at all. Parasitic relationships are relationships in which one organism benefits at the expense of the other organism.

Additionally, here are several sources that do not add the stipulation of species to the definition or parasite. Note that these are not simply English dictionaries, but biological dictionaries intended to define terms as they can be used in a scientific context.    http://biology-online.org/dictionary/ Parasite     http://en.mimi.hu/biology/parasite.html    http://www.wordiq.com/definition/ Parasite     http://www.medterms.com/script/main/ art.asp?articlekey=4769     So who cares what is legal and what is not legal. Laws change all the time. Wasn't slavery considered legal? Isn't it illegal now? Aobrtion is the intentional taking of a human life and murder is also the intentional taking of a human life.    It's the human life part you seem to be having a problem with. Yes, the fetus is alive, and it has human DNA, but I think it is foolish to place its life on the same level as, say, an actual baby. To do so is to say abortion is identical to the murder of a 6 month old baby.    Let me put it this way to you, I am standing holding a gun to a man's head, and i have two choices, one is to kill him and the other is not to kill him. If i kill him i will be doing something that is both morally and legally wrong. If i save him, i will be doing something that is both morally and legally right.   If another organism (human or not) is using a human being as a life support system, the human that is functioning as a life support system has a right to order the end of such a relationship. In your example, the man you are about to shoot is perfectly capable of living without using your body; if you wish to end your involvement with him, you can walk away. A woman who wants to get an abortion does not have this luxury, so the situations are incomparable in that respect. I posed a hypothetical situation in a previous post that I believe you also ignored:  Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and force one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of charging them with murder if they do not? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.   You still used the term fetus so the laws still apply to fetus and homicide which means that the fetus is still considered as human life.   The homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America because a fetus is not legally considered a human life. Do you live in country where they do, or do you live in fantasy America?   I also fail to see how my use of the term 'fetus' means that the law suddenly applies to it.    But one of the laws of science in defining the term of life states that inorder for an individual to be referred to as having life, they have to be able to be distinguished from the dead. Again, not my opinion but the findings of scientists.   You do realize that I am not arguing that the fetus is dead, right?   So is that why you want to kill a fetus? Because you know it will develop into a human being because according to you an aborted fetus cannot develop into a human being. Why would it develop into a human being if you already took the life of it? Furthermore, when a fetus is formed, organ formation begins about three weeks after the fetus itself is formed including a beating heart which pumps blood.   It is nonsensical to imply that anyone wants to kill a fetus  because  it will develop into a human being. People get abortions because they do not want to be pregnant, and pregnancy should be a voluntary process. If there was a way in which the pregnancy could be terminated and the fetus preserved, that would be ideal. As it is, no such thing exists, the interests of a fully developed and conscious human being should override the interests of a fetus that has no more consciousness than a human lung.   NB: When i mentioned the term "you" i am referring to pro choice supporters and not you specifically. Furthermore let me also be clear that i support spontaneous abortion and not induced abortion since spontaneou abortion since spontaneous abortion is beyond the control of the woman.   Even the accidental loss of human life merits an investigation, and it is quite possible to purposefully induce a miscarriage through many avenues. If a fetus is placed on the same level as a human being, then women who miscarried should be immediately subjected to an investigation and arrested for murder if it was determined she is at least partially responsible for the miscarriage, either through intention or negligence.

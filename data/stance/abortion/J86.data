Firstly, just because abortion was illegal up until the early 70s does not mean women weren't having it done. It's an archaic procedure - the earliest recorded abortion was in Egypt, 1550 BCE. And they'll continue to do it in the future. You just need to get over it. Secondly, you can be both. You can believe in abortion under the right circumstances.    "It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped. So the rape is one violent act... and abortion is the next."   Could you be anymore heartless? The mother never  asked  to be victimized, so if she chooses abortion, it's more of an act she was  forced  into, not one she decided upon of her own volition. Why wouldn't you call the man who raped her a murderer, in essence? And let's consider for a moment the victim decided to keep her child - what do you think she may one day tell him/her when they continually ask where their father is? "Honey, you were a mistake and your father brutally raped me in a dark alley somewhere?" Yeah, kudos for Father of the Year! In this case, he would have victimized  two  people instead of just one.   "No birth control is 100% effective... unless you get fixed."   Are you honestly suggesting people  not  have sex from fear they might get pregnant? Go shout that in the town square, see how many agree. I agree, people should practice safe sex, but if they take all necessary precautions and get pregnant anyway, and decided for whatever reason the time isn't right, they're entitled to an abortion.

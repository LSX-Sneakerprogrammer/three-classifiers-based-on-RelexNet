When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.   Doesn't matter.  In cell culture life begins after the cells separate in mitosis.  We're talking about when a foetus has independent thought and recognises that it is being killed. This is highly dubious if the foetus just barely started brain development, and barely has functioning organs.   Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?   Different topic.   What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?   Who cares? It's not your business. Should the number of feminist activists out there decide our choice to maintain womens' suffrage?   How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?   You don't actually care about the mother, so why bring this up?  It's more of a loaded question anyway because most medical procedures have a mortality rate, and are legal. Also women who undergo late-term abortion themselves are under increased risk of harm.   Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?   Welcome to universal healthcare, or attempts at it anyway.   If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified. Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.   Being a good lawyer isn't about questing for the truth, it is about defending a conclusion in a convincing way. Your conclusion is that abortion is wrong, so you'll only care about that which supports your ability to persuade others.

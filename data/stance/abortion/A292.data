No, it's called moral absolutism and it's intelectually lazy because it means that you refuse to actually think about the issue and use personal judgement when deciding what is right and wrong.  No one likes getting an abortion, and everyone would be happier if there were less abortions; however, in the very early stages when all there is, is a clump of cells, a woman should be able to choose whether she want sto conitinue with the pregancy.  In addition, we already have systems in place that grant increasing rights with age, so I don't see how this case is any different.

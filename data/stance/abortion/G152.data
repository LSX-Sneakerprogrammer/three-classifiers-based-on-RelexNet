If someone is irresponsible enough to avoid having the baby, they are not responsible enough to have the baby. If there is choice, then there is chance to ruin only one life. But if a baby is raised by people not ready, or incapable of raising a baby, then that would ruin two lives. The babies and the mothers at least. Maybe three, including the father.

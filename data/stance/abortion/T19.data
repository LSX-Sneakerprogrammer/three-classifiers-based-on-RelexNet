At what point do you believe the zygote becomes a "person"? Also, are you meaning to say that the fetus purposefully "commandeered" the mother's body? I don't believe the baby had a choice which body it wanted to inhabit.   The easy answer is when it is born. The more complicated answer is when it has developed its brain.

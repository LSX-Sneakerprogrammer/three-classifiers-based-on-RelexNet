this is a tiresome argument.   as long as people (women) are getting pregnant and people (women and men) don't wanna have that pregnancy, then we will have abortions regardless of laws, so-called morals, etc.  the answer is adequate 1) health/sex information and 2) improved availability to contraception since historically (stupid) efforts to control sex have failed

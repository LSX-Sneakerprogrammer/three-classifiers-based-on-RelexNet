You're so closed minded it's ridiculous.  In fact, quite a few people have experienced abortion first hand, and it's never an easy decision, but sometimes it is the right one.  It doesn't matter what the thing  looks  like. Science tells us that thing is  not  yet a sentient being, therefore it  is not  killing a sentient being. Cute pictures does not = sound scientific reasoning.  You don't like abortion. Fine, don't have one, but that you  choose  not to believe the  fact  that at ten weeks that little thing has 0 sense of self, does not constitute any type of proof that abortion should be banned for those who choose to undergo it  before  that thing  is  sentient.  No one is for abortion once the child is self-aware. A self-aware human should not be aborted.  That is  not  a self-aware human, no matter how cute.   And that said, the vast vast majority of abortions take place before the first couple weeks.  And that said, most  science  says there is not even a  hint  of  possible  self-awareness until around 26 weeks!

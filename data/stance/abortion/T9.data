And if you didn't want to have your leg crushed in a car accident maybe you shouldn't have driven on the road. The only sure-safe way to avoid a car accident is never to go anywhere near a car.  So if you are ever in a car accident it's obviously your own fault for doing something so reckless. Why exactly should we be required to expend all kinds of expensive medical treatment fixing the results of your irresponsibility?  Edit: Also, what an amazing coincidence that two completely different people named "Edwardxx" who both have very low post counts and similar posting styles posted back to back "no" arguments within 5 minutes of each other. Isn't the world a funny place?

Yes, of course. It's ridiculous to tell a woman that it is not her choice to keep or get rid of her unborn child. She will be the one to carry it and ultimately decide to keep it or not. And, to arguments that say the child could, 'grow up to be someone special', yes, and he/she could grow up to be someone who contributes nothing to society at all. Anyway, I'd rather have one less abused or neglected child, don't we have enough kids with horrible lives? Why would you want to put someone in that position? Also, you can't force the woman bear the child! What happened to all our rights?

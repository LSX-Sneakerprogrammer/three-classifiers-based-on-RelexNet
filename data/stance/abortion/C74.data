What an ignorant thought. Of course you would have existed. While you obviously wouldn't realize what was happening,   If I had no awareness of my existence before it was terminated, then it is not really a factor to me.    it is still a horrible violation of human rights.    Looks like you got a little mixed up. Not forcing a woman to incubate a fetus she doesn't want is a  preservation  of a human right; the right to bodily autonomy.   Studies have shown again and again that when aborted, the baby is not just a lifeless blob of tissue, it is A LIVING BEING. You jusyt won't accept the evidence. I don't what else must happen to rid you of your foolish thoughts.   Nobody is arguing that a fetus is a lifeless blob of tissue. What they are arguing is that it does not deserve all the rights of a conscious and/or independent human being, especially when granting them such rights would override the rights of an  actual  person - the mother.

What you on about? LOL you actually make laugh  God loves killing babies?  If God loved killing babies would you not be dead?  God loves children you fool.  Your just an idiotic athiest who doesnt even know what he's talking about.     Have you ever read the bible? The biblical god has smote children on more than one occasion. The common examples are the flood (children were among those to be drowned), and the first-born of Egypt (as if a first-born child has any idea of what's going on at that age, and deserves death). Then there are battles in which the god-approved side was given the approval (blessing) to kill everyone in the opposing side, including sacking their cities, and their women and children. Also, do not forget that a kid who is disrespectful towards his or her parents is to be put to death.

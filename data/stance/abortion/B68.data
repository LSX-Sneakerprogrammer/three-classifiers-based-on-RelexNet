Abortion is the choice of the woman, because she has the child. It is best if at the beginning of pregnancy abortion, because that is the child is not large. Just before the birth abortion, I find it disgusting, because the child has to a large extent to be born perfect. So I think it's good as long as it is the beginning of pregnancy, but just before giving birth.

http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/ fetaldevelopment.html    (This law in no way magically makes a fetus any more or less sentient. If I made a law that toasters were human, it would not make it so.)  You do not make the laws. This statement has little if nothing to do with the fact that people with your mentality decide what they want the law to be when they want it to be that way.  And i clearly did state that it is the issue of where the "Fetus" is. If the "fetus" was to be in an egg outside of the women, your argument would no longer stand. The only reason you think it is right to kill an unborn child is because the fetus is a cluster of both the womens cells and the mans sperm in the body of a women. If it were to be a cluster of cells in an egg your form of logic would fall apart, because it is no longer part of the women.

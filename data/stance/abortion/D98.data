Endowed by their creator? There are 1.1 billion people in the world who seem to disagree with the idea that we have a creator. Your entire argument crumbles right from that beginning and until you can provide evidence that proves beyond a doubt that a) such a creator exists and that b) he has given us these rights, the rest of your post is pointless. Do not bring religion into a political, and perhaps even scientific debate.  Also, "Imagine forcing people with religious and other beliefs against abortion to pay for them through their taxes. That is what the government now does if not stopped."  Do you have ANY idea how often atheists and other unaffiliated people in America are forced to pay taxes that end up going to strictly religious causes? Why not attack that? Don't use a double standard here.

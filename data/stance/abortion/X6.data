Seek the truth, not what you want the truth to be.  That's why I'm not religious. Which religion? All say to believe, yet why? Must I believe or can I just not believe?   It's why I follow science and logic. To me, to be logical is to reduce pain in the world, increase happiness, and gain knowledge, while being safe and helping people.  That is why I must be pro-life AND pro-choice. I cannot force others to my opinion, just as others cannot force me, because it is only an opinion.   Normally, I am against killing, but a fetus is a lot different than a fully grown human, or even a child.  Anyways, I try to aim for objective truth in an objective world, so unless you believe in the supernatural, or things that can't be proven, my opinion, I've noted is almost always 100% correct, or consistent with my logic/morals. Happiness, freedom and knowledge are important to me, and on a debate forum, they should be to you too!  Have a nice day. =D

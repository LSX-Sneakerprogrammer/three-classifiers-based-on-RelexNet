The real solution to this problem is gto institute the idea that sex outside of marriage is wrong. In a marriage if you have a child abortion really is out of the question, if that's too much to ask at least practice "Safe Sex" Another term I dont really believe in although i do believe some sex is safer than others sex is never really safe outside of marriage.

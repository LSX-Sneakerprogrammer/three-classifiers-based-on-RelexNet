So to have sex, even with protection, one should be ready to accept the potential outcomes, however unlikely.   Even if that is the case, I doubt that you can suggest that parents who use contraception are "irresponsible".   A zygote has the DNA of a homo sapien.   It possess the DNA of a homo sapien, no doubt. But it is not a homo sapien.   It is obviously alive. You are too smart to argue that it is dead.   Didn't I say that I agree it is alive?   Life is a scientific definition for our proposes so it is inappropriate for you to cite the OED.   You are committing the genetic fallacy here.   Did you think I wouldn't notice your clever addition? It is a human being (organism).    Yes, it is a human being and I don't argue against that. But is it sentient? In other words, does it possess rationality, autonomy  and  self-consciouness?

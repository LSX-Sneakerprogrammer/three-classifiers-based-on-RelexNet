so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?  I decided to make up names/categories because i don't know already established names for these concepts. they are defined as they come up, feel free to suggest alternative names.  If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.   However because rights are awarded to human beings which lack even basic brain functions and that it would be very difficult to define personhood in such a way to non-arbitarily include only human-beings in pre-birth periods of development as having non-person-hood then AFS might as well be considered unsound and thus inconclusive on weather fetuses have rights.    Another argument whose conclusion is the following: That all human beings which lack a brain/braintissue also lack rights (lets call it Argument from um... biology? AFB) would have nothing to say on any human beings with a brain or with any brain tissue. AFB would be sound from my first analysis of it. . another argument stating that there is a certain amount of brain development required would have something to say on all human beings which do not reach the period of development(Lets call this argument the up-till-a-point argument or UPA).  your #2 is a very good insight for It would be very beneficial to distinguish between parts of the brain which give rise to consciousness, awareness, etc(C-functions) and which just simply pump the heart, work the lungs, etc(H-functions). If it can be shown that H-functions are the only functions present till a certain point then that point would be a very good point to use for the UPA argument.   all three of the above arguments come in the form of Barbara.( I forgot to put a 'a' in-between the 'b' and 'r' in my last post.) thus if someone disagreed with them they would have to attack their premises.   I like how you pick your sources, very good.  I like number 3. I think science needs to be used more in legal matters. It too often seems like politicians yelling at each other and not backing themselves up by empirical methods.  a sort summery of my criticism on the AFS is that some brain functions, like awareness disappear nightly. sleeping would constitute aberrant behavior of awareness; however it reappears when one awakes. If a certain level of awareness must be demonstrated for a human being to be a person then person-hood is lost nightly along with rights since AFS considers them dependent on person-hood.This is not the case in actuality, people maintain rights despite sleeping. If awareness must be within a statistical likelihood of occurring within a certain amount of time, aka capable; then those constraints would be arbitrary and why they are chosen would need to be shown superior to other constraints like a longer period of time(9 months) or such in order to be more acceptable then a similar argument with different constants(a fetus being a hypothetical person and thus deserving of rights for example, similar because a sleeping human-being would also constitute a hypothetical person) . awareness also seems like one of those things which would have to be included in person-hood, in order for it to have much value.

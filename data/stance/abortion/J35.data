doubt that you can call the use of contraception "irresponsible".   No. But contraception is not 100% effective. Even with protection, the parents are fully accept g (or rationally should be) that a pregnancy is a possible outcome of their...activities. So to have sex, even with protection, one should be ready to accept the potential outcomes, however unlikely.   Second, your other premise is the the zygote is a human life.   Human=homo sapien. A zygote has the DNA of a homo sapien. It is obviously alive. You are too smart to argue that it is dead. Life is a scientific definition for our proposes so it is inappropriate for you to cite the OED.    a zygote is not a sentient human being.   Did you think I wouldn't notice your clever addition? It is a human being (organism). You can't argue against that.

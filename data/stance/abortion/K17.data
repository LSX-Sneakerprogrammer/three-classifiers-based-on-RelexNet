Yes, but that 12 year old wasnt aware once. That 12 year old didnt have a heart or a brain but look at it now, its living a life. imagine all the LIFES that were aborted 12 years ago, they would all be children now. Going to school, planning their future but they were deprived of this which to me is completely immoral.     It doesn't matter what would become of the foetus. We don't defend the rights of something based on a merely possible future outcome. What matters is what the foetus or embryo is today. Anything after that is a single possibility out of an infinity of choices. This is why we don't consider ejaculations or ovulations as life. They too have a small possibility of becoming the child in your hypothetical future.  Take a look at this:   http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/ wwwhuman/Stages/Images/Cst800.jpg    This is what you're comparing to a 12-year old. It has no heart, nor does it have many of the organs you do. It's in development. No proper brain, because that's forming. For all intents and purposes in this early stage, it's not a person.

In Susan Wicklund's book "this common secret" about her struggles as an abortion provider, she tells a story of a woman who goes in for an abortion because she believes her abusive husband will kill the baby if she has it. She is turned down, and shortly after the baby is born, she appears at the E.R. with the dead baby. Which is better, Renee, the chance of a baby ACTUALLY being killed, or never being born?  Abortion is NOT child abuse. murder and real abuse is.  people are more likely to abuse a child they don't want right?  Why not give them the chance to not abuse a child at all?

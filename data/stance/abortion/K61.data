I am sorry if I'm "forcing" my opinion on people saying you better believe or else... if i am tell me and i will try to be more easy going. I just want people to come to God other wise they will perish. Its hard to explain Christians just have this feeling they not what they say is right but it is very hard to try to prove it. People now a days want pure you can see evidence but if people would just start seeing with there hearts more then they would realize they were missing out of even more wonderful things. I know what i say is the truth, I have that deep down in my gut feeling that what i speak is truth about God and Christianity.

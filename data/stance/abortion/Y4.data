Because sexual activity is awesome and a sign of good health. It is a primal action that is at the foundation of humans' hierarchy of needs (according to Maslow:  http://www.colinchristianson.com/ wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ 800px-maslows_hierarchy_of_needssvg.png)                                         ) So stopping sex is not the solution to the abortion debate. People do need to be careful and do need to be held accountable for their actions, but accidents happen and shouldn't people be able to have a choice in how to deal with such a life-altering event?

You need a better interpreter then me but i will give it my best. Jesus here is speaking that the Old Testament was speaking of his coming. (verses 17-18)  In verse 19 he is talking about the 10 Commandment. When Jesus was crucified it ended some of the laws in the Old Testament not including the 10 Commandments.  Here is a link to that:  http://www.gotquestions.org/ Christian-law.html       I read it from the supposed word of god itself. The bible is very clear that Jesus said that the laws are to be obeyed until heaven and earth come together, and he fulfils his role (because it mentions heaven and earth, this means the crucifixion is apart from it).  You need to stop reading apologetics and try reading the bible, the book that is supposed to be infallible according to your beliefs, but you seem to require others to interpret it for you.

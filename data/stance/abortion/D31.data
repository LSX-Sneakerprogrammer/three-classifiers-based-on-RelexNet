firstly Is it not legal in the US ??   in Britain it has been legal for along time. and i know i sided with the YES however most valid points have been made and i would just like to say i believe that the time period needs to be properly looked at. 24 weeks and a baby is well a baby... not a feetus. and the abortion process at that stage is horrific. chopping up the baby to get it to fit our of the whom.... i do not want to go on.  but i think there should be a shorter limit on it. also if someone take so long to decide then they may be unsure or be being forced into it (may have been hiding it)..... should defiantly be more regulations. ect to ensure a safer system

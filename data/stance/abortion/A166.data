The reason I'm breaking it all down for all you pro-life people is that YOU ALL feel the need to project YOUR GUILT on others who has the view that they're not killing a person! It's your guilt, not others'. Feel it yourself! Go to confession if you're Catholic. Do whatever you need to do.  You all keep telling us that it's murder! I can safely say that about 9/10 arguments found on here are based upon that ONE SINGLE point, which may I add is completely incorrect! It's how we see it. If you don't like that, then we pity you. Just don't force your view on us and then try to push for a law that govern our lives too!  Reproduction means the world to the human race? What about unchecked reproduction like in China and India where the one child policy has created more problems and actual murders then is necessary?  We all agree that at the end of the 9 months it's an actual human life. I actually made the point that at week 20 it has a slight chance of survival and should be saved, as society can now intervene.

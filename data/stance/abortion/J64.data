If its so disgusting then why do you want it legal so people can do it? You stand in the same line as they do if you want it legal. There is no moral difference. You simply do not want protection for the unborn. How is this pro-life?  You state abortion is disgusting and that its gross irreverence for lifeâ€¦  You can't' be both. You can't want abortion legal and then claim your pro-life .  Your position is morally baffling.

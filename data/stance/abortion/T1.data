It really is the mother's decision. If she isn't wanting to take care of it who will? Yes the father maybe... but what if your raped, what if you didnt want the baby and the husband altered the birthcontrol pills into something else. Yes you could put it into an adoption agency, but what if they grow up wonderign why there parents gave them up? They would feel like crap thinking that there parents hated them, and be suicidel. No one deserves the live of bouncing around in foster homes, thinking no one loves them. They may get into a caring family but do you know how many kids get into crappy situations? It is the persons decisions, we souldnt have a law saying this is a bad thing to do. Its a moral and a value we all have and we all have different views. why should we care about what other people do with there lives. especally people we dont even know.

Having its own DNA and all the systems that isolate it from the mother's body does not change the fact that it's completely a part of the mother. It will not amount to anything if it's detached from her.  .   I did have it right when I said your view decides when a life is worthy of life and when a life is unworthy of life.   You can think what you like, but at 20 weeks' gestation a fetus is still a person. The fact that society may be able to save it without its mother does not automatically make it a person. It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.  .   And about this notion of "potential life!" by all the standard definitions of life, it's alive and has been throughout, potentiality is a farce   I don't know where you get your definition, but  until  it has a fully functional, self-sustaining biological system and is not attached to another life via the umbilical cord, I'm going to regard it as potential.  .   And finally were do you get this arbitrary standard of survival and person hood   It's not arbitrary, it's fact. Me and a lot of other people hold this view. We make the laws to help us with our lives. At the moment, we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help, and your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.

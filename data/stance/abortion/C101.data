"Even the devil can quote scripture for his own purposes."  I think I may just use this against every bible-crazed person I ever debate. Thank you for this.  "A foetus has no mind. It isn't complete"  A fetus does not even have a neruological system until the 5th week  "it cannot think like you [supposedly] can"  "our minds truly mature in women at her late teenage years, in men at his early twenties"  again, the mind only starts to  possibly  form after the development of a brain, at 5 weeks

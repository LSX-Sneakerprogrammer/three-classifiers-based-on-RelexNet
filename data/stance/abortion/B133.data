it is a yes or no. Its yes, I am prolife and believe the unborn has a right to live....or no I do not value all life and believe women should always have the right to kill. Less than 1 percent of ALL ABORTIONS are done for actual medical reasons.   SAved it all the pain? How do you know it cant feel pain? Abortion is legal dismemberment of a human being WHILE IT IS ALIVE. Now if this is not child abuse I don't know what is.   The issue is whether or not the unborn deserves personhood, whether or not women have the right to kill on demand for any reason.

Before it's able to survive outside of the woman's womb, it's only a potential life, not an actual life. Society cannot keep it alive so society should not interfere.   As a potential, it is in the same class as a single egg or sperm. Of course, once birthed the child still has no guarantee of life due to SIDS, diseases, etc... but at least it has a better chance of survival. So, before the period of 20 weeks, it has no chance of survival outside of the womb, so the woman should have the choice of keeping it or not.

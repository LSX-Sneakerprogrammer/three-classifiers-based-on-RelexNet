Abortion is immoral because it eliminates life.   When it comes to rape, women can have choice to abort or not abort. I support either decision. However, it is immoral to abort always. I also believe it is selfish.   If you are just careless, don't abort. It is not the anybody's fault but the female's fault. Why not the man's fault too? Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg. Therefore, when a woman's get pregnant, it is the woman's fault only. Except when the situation comes to rape but this is not rape.   But this topic is pointless. Selfish or not, a murderer will kill, a rapists will rape, a "abortionist" will abortion. What are you going to do? Keep an eye on the woman? You can and i believe you are doing a good deed. But i am not going to spend the rest of my life watching over a woman and stopping her from getting an abortion EVERY time. It is sad what i have said. That i won't help. But i have a life and this is not what i want to do with my life. To put this in short, if a woman wants to get an abortion, SHE WILL GET AN ABORTION.   I believe adoption is a good option. And i believe it should be an only option. My opinion is similiar to ColdFire.   This is my opinion. I am Pro And Con. Im ProCon. And im not yelling. :)  Edit. Im an idiot. It is both the man's fault and the woman's fault for the woman getting pregnant. What was i thinking?

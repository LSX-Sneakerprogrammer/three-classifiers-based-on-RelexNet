You obviously feel killing is ok, I do not.   I have never made this claim. You are putting words in my mouth.   You don't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion.   That is because I don't think abortion is wrong  in every circumstance . I think some people have the wrong motivations to abort a baby and/or under the wrong medical circumstances, making  some  abortion cases morally wrong.   I give it personhood   But the idea of personhood is something that you have not defined clearly. If you want to argue on the basis of personhood, then a baby within the first trimester doesn't even have a brain to speak of. It, therefore, doesn't have the ability to  feel , let alone reason, within the first trimester.   War is about protection….how can the unborn fight for its protection?   You are comparing the two wrongly. War is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself. Even if I were to accept that the unborn baby is a person (which is a view that I do not  necessarily  agree with, as I've explained above), then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life-threatening illness!   Well obviously you don't think life is sacred…your pro-abortion. LOL   I'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour. That just goes to show how frivolous you are. What a hypocrite. And, by the way, I don't think  human  life is sacred and I don't believe in the sanctity of human life. If you think that life is sacred, then you, by logical deduction, should not be able to eat anything that has life (i.e. animals and even vegetables and fruits).   Its nine short months…to do what is right…to allow something to live…   You are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through  during  the nine "short" months. Furthermore, you said "allow something to live", right? If the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother, then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the MOTHER to live. If you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby, are you doing what is "right"?   AFter conception it is a separate human being   It is not. As I have explained, the baby is not a human being within the first trimester. Furthermore, the unborn baby, no matter at any stage, is dependent on it's mother  completely  for nutrition. In other words, the baby is, technically speaking, a  parasite . The Oxford English Dictionary defines a "parasite" as "Biol. An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and draws its nutriment directly from it. Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc." Thus, by definition, the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body  AT THE EXPENSE OF HER OWN HEALTH .   How barbaric and cold is that?   Which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not. Or whether it should be legal or not. This is simply an appeal to emotion.   It should not matter whether the child will make it or not.   Then, whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you. Pro-choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision. They do NOT promote abortion, simply the  legalisation  of abortion. If you can't see the difference, then you're an idiot.   Abortion is premeditated killing.   And so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live. If the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, by not aborting the child, you are also premeditating the killing of the mother. Thus, by your standards, you face a paradox. I am appalled by how people can call themselves "pro-life" when they say that the mother's life doesn't matter as long as the baby is not aborted. This is hypocrisy of the greatest degree.   Most pro-aborts say abortion is good because……the child might have problems…might grow up in poverty……might face lives trials….   I am not a "pro-abort". I am pro-choice, as I have explained the difference.   So don't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life….so full of misery that they would be better off dead.   You are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery. Thus, you are attacking a straw man. Poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been "allowed to survive" face.   You said this…."Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy  and self-consciousness."  Now wait one minute here. Can a newborn baby do any of these? No.   Of course it does. It has autonomy and self-consciousness. But then again, even if I agree with you, by saying that a newborn baby can't have such experiences, it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral. Thus, your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand.   Are you telling me that you want abortion legal….because the woman has a right to her own body   The short answer is "yes", but the long answer is "no". Congratulations, you have proven that you at least have  some  level of intelligence.

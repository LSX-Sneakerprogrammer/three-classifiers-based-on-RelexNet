You chose to act irresponsibly.   I got pregnant whilst using the contraceptive pill, it's not as uncommon as you think. Don't assume every person who is pregnant isn't responsible. Just to clarify I didn't abort her, I have a daughter. However I'm just using this as a point that not all accidental pregnancies are because people are stupid enough to have sex without contraception.  Now, rape and incest aren't the only circumstance that warrant abortion. Have you considered medical problems, deformities and disabilities in an unborn baby? What about a heroin addict, a alcoholic? What about someone with severe mental health problems (bi-polar, schizophrenia, BPD)? How about a homeless person? Do you think it is okay in these cases?  I don't think any situation should dictate whether a Mother decides to proceed with a pregnancy. It's how the mother (or doctor)  perceives  the circumstance of her pregnancy. If she feels the unborn child would have a negative life or her life would be impacted seriously (not superficially) then she has the right to terminate her pregnancy.

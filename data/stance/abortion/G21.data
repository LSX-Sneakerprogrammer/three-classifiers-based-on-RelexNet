Do you have any evidence to suggest that the fetus is more of a parasitic entity? It is not a conscious being but so are the people who are paralyzed who depend on other people to take care of them even though they are on life support machines. According to you a fetus is not a conscious being so how can it infringe on a person's right to her own body?

I did not say that having a baby was an accident.   "Your entire argument fails if we apply the same standard to any accident."  So either  1) you do indeed think it is an accident  OR  2) Your analogy fails as it is being compared to a straw man.   I think that you'll find yourself to be wrong there.   How so?   But that is not the fault of the people using the contraceptives.   Irrelevant. They knew it is possible and they are at fault for ignoring all the possibilities.   ope. I don't think so. I won't let you back away from your own challenge so easily.   Well then How does human not equal homo sapien?   I've never claimed it to be fatal. It doesn't have to be fatal to be bad or wrong.    Exactly. I am only in favor of abortion in cases where it would be fatal.   I admit that. But you haven't actually posed any significant challenge to me on those cases.   I have indeed. They new the consequences. They ignored them.

Your argument is specious. The sick and handicapped are not at issue. People with cancer are not at issue. None of them have hooked themselves up to the bodies of autonomous adults whose physiological functions are then used to regulate their own.  And of course, the first one to make an overblown comparison between the issue at hand and Nazism is inevitably the loser in any given debate.

Im not a Dr. but I do believe a fetus is a human. Aborting it is playing gods role. With that said, look back at your past. Many of us have been in situations where a baby would be unbearable, faced with the pressures of a young life, an abortion almost would seem right. Isn't it scary that it would be readily available? You could get the procedure before even giving the idea much though. It shouldn't be an option. It should be illegal.

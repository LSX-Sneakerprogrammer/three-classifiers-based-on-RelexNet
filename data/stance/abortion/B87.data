I think they did a scientific study a while ago about when a fetus can feel pain (or when the brain was active) and used that to create a cut off point of 24 weeks (in the UK). However this has obviously been discredited after babies as young as 22 weeks have survived, yet the abortion gestation has not changed. This is clearly inhumane, and I think it  should  be lowered. But how you would find a ethical gestation point is beyond me.

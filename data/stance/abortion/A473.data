If a woman/girl is in danger of dying from having a baby, and was either raped or unaware of the fact that she was having sex (because they have never been educated), then they should have the right to not get physically hurt from having the baby or waste 9 months of their life, having to take time off from work to care for a baby she will give up anyway–if it even survives. If she doesn't die from having the baby, she will still be in a position of a weaker person. She will be less fit, and might even lose her job because she had to take a maternity leave.  My mother was 26 when she got pregnant with her first child. My father and she were very happy–until 4 months in when she found out that her baby, who she had already named Sarah, had a severe heart condition, where even if it did survive past birth (less than 1% chance), would have serious handicaps its entire life. Is it fair to cause Sarah to feel complete pain and suffering her entire life? At least with the abortion that my mother got, Sarah could feel no pain. She wanted that baby more than anything or anyone else in the world, and her heart was broken that she could not deliver the joy to Sarah that Sarah had first given to her. For three years my mother did not try to have a baby again, and those three years were the hardest of her life.  I agree that it's horrible for a woman to abort a child because they can't afford it, or don't want it, in those cases they should put the baby up for adoption. But if the baby or the woman is in extreme danger, then the woman has the right to choose. If you honestly think that it could be legalized for rape, but not for anything else, then how would you judge if it were rape or not? Even if the person could get consent from a judge, by then the baby would be even closer to being born and have more nerves that could feel the pain. Abortion must be either legal or illegal, and it is unfair to cause people like my mother to have even more emotional suffering. So I cast my vote for abortion being legal.  P.S. I may only be a 14 year old boy, but I have extensive knowledge on political fronts and current events, and my education thus far has been one of the best available to a public school. It has also been scientifically proven that children on average can see the correct answers to problems more easily than adults if given the same amount of knowledge because they have less emotional backgrounds that will impair their logic.

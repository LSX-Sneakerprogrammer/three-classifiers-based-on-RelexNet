When you say that term neither you are portraying to me that either you are confused or you are not sure which side to take.   I am pro-choice. I've been pro-choice since the beginning of this debate and I've made that clear several times. If you haven't realized this by now then it is you who is confused, not I.   How can you be neither when everything you said so far has supported pro abortion?   Exactly what did I write that gave you the idea I'm "pro-abortion"? Do you think I want to make abortions mandatory or something? I'm not pro abortion or anti abortion, there are cases where abortion is a good choice, and cases where it is a bad choice; but regardless of the case, it's not our choice. It's hers.   If there were two teams and each of these teams were either pro life or pro abortion, which one would you choose?   If there were two teams, one was pro-rape and the other was pro-arson, which one would you choose? -_-   Obviously, there is no way that you can say neither, so which team will you choose?   Neither.   Huh... I guess I could say neither, couldn't I. ;)  It's almost as though I have... a choice. o.O   When people say pro choice they are referring to a woman's right to have an abortion. Do some research on the topic please.   When did I say pro-choice was NOT referring to a woman's right to have an abortion? What are you even talking about?   You words tells a lot about you and to be very honest with you that is why my response is coming so low graded to you because expect to get what you portray.   You're lying again. You've been acting like an idiot since the beginning AND you've been acting like an idiot towards others. Or are they all "low graded" as well? But even if what you say is true, you'd still be an idiot because that is the only kind of person that would purposefully debate poorly to "match" his opponents wit.   Well i do not care what you say because like i said am the creator of this debate and you are the person challenging me so to me it means less.   What means less? You haven't connected this sentence to anything so I have no idea what you're talking about.   You seem to forget that you are debunking without facts so if i am liar good for me.   I'm not using facts... so it's good that you're a liar? You make less and less sense every post.   You seem to think facts are some holy grail and whomever has the most of them "wins" or something. Let me tell you, in matters of philosophy logic trumps facts. you can string together miles of facts, if the logic doesn't follow then you're wrong.   Again i will not have you calling me names and if you do not stop then i will restrain you from posting any arguments in relation to my debates because name calling is childishness to me and the same goes for comparing.   I repress nothing about myself. If I feel like calling you an idiot then I will and if you aren't mature enough to handle such criticism then perhaps your better off banning me.  It would only show your insecurities.   I think your problem is you love to judge and if you continue doing that then again i will restrain you from debate and then we will see who is the debater and the respondent.   Once again, you're projecting. If "judging" is a ban-able offense in your books then you should of banned yourself a hundred times over.   Let us keep it to a professional level please.   I agree, lets keep it professional. I'll stop calling you names and you stop:  Straw-man-ing  Lying  Red-herring....ing  Appealing to authority  Appealing to emotion  And going off topic  I think this sound more than fair.   My conclusion is drawn from facts which i have demonstrated in my arguments but you point to one part where you made reference to facts?   Yeas, I have you an example where I used a fact. What, you want me to re-type EVERYTHING I've written out thus far and highlight everything that qualifies as a fact???  Look, I've debunked you're conclusions. Now you either concede or go about un-debunking me. THAT'S how a debate works. It's not about who has the most facts, it's about who's position makes the most sense.   Did you see my entire argument was based on fallacy? Because if you said so then i think you are jumping to an inconsistent conclusion.   Inconsistent with what? Do you even know what the word inconsistent means? (rhetorical)  Everything you've said so far has been one of the things I asked you to stop doing earlier in this post. They are all fallacies, so yes, your entire argument is based on fallacy. You've even admitted that your arguments are based on appeals to emotion/authority, so I'm not sure exactly what you're complaining about here...   And again i do not care what you call me because like i said i have already proved myself to a panel of judges.   Really? Just 2 (two!) paragraphs ago you threatened to ban me based on what I call you. You, once again, are lying.   You can say all you want but it wouldn't affect me but lets just keep it as a debate on a professional level.   You know my proposal. The balls in your court.

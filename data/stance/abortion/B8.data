Finally I forgot to ask... You believe the male should have a right in the choice of abortion. What if the male wanted an abortion and the woman didn't? I assume you wouldn't be so happy about that right then. That's part of the reason why men don't generally have a  legal say , baring in mind most woman consult with the father and come to a mutual agreement anyway. You also argue that pregnancy is entirely down the woman yet you believe she shouldn't have the final say on the child. So which is it, is the woman solely responsible for pregnancy and the child or are both sexes equally responsible?

False. While society's definition of Pro-life is actually a purely anti-abortion stance. I follow a more traditional understanding of the definition of Pro-life, which is I am for whatever is more conducive to saving human life.Also, did you even read my comment? I said I personally believe that it should only happen if it is to save the mother's life. However, people should be free to get abortions if they want too. That's the beauty of choice. Without the option to do wrong, "right" is meaningless.

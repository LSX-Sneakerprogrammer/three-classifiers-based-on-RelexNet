Try pricking a newborn with a needle and see if it has feelings, won't you?   Any creature with a nervous system has "feelings", what I am referring to are thoughts and emotions.   No, you're wrong here. The fetus is considered a parasite.   It is both, humans maybe parasites for the first nine months of their existence, but they are still human.    Conversely, when a woman chooses to abort the fetus, she is simply disallowing the fetus to continue living within her.   Thus killing a human being.   The fetus, within the first trimester, is not a person.   You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human, but rather parasites. Unborn babies still fit the definition of "parasite" regardless of what trimester they're in. Do you contend that the unborn baby can be both a parasite and a person at the same time?

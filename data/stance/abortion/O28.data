Doesn't the fetus have the same right to its own body?  Stop with the emotional appeals.   If every human being( irregardless of if they are human "persons") has the right to life and to what happens to their body, then a fetus, by being a human being, also has those rights. For preemptive reasons: If a fetus is not a human being, then what stops us from denying babies, old people, or others with limited functionality as being human beings?  Is it not wrong for a person to decide if another's life is worth while? I would of reckoned that is for each individual to decide.

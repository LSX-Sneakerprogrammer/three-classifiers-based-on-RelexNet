These little unborn infants are also living things as we are and when women kill them, it is the almost the same as killing an adult or a child. I can say that God is creator of everything and when we kill unborn babies we destroy his creations.  According to the wordds of Nattyc "Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides." abortion is a selfigh decision and I absolutely agree with this statement. We must think about other people, especially about the closet ones. At the time of pregnancy the unborn baby of the wonam is the closest person to her. Women have to appreciaete and save it.

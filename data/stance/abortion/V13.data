You seem to have missed my point. Perhaps I wasn't clear enough.  Concerning the issue of abortion - by what right and under what authority does anyone claim the power to deny the fundamental right of an individual to choose for herself? Regardless of the circumstance or whether you agree with her choice.  By the way, kudos for speaking your mind when creating this debate rather than opting for the hackneyed "cutting and pasting." That would be somewhat trite, don't you think?

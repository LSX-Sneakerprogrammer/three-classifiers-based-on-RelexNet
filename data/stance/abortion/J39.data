If they are not prepared for the consequences, then yes.   But to declare them to be irresponsible, by your own definition of what irresponsible parents are supposed to act like, would be presumptuous.   You added a "technically" in there which expressed hesitance and some doubt. But this is a good start.   "Technically" does not  necessarily  imply hesitance and doubt. I used it in the sense of "by definition".   Apparently we are stuck at the human=homo sapien part.   No, we aren't. A zygote may be alive, but it is not a homo sapien.   For example, the colloquial definition of a "theory" and a scientific definition of a "theory" are completely different.   Which has no bearing on whether the OED's definition is true or not. I can give thousands of definitions from the OED which is very much inline with the scientific community's. You raised the example of "theory". According to the OED, a "theory" refers to "A conception or mental scheme of something to be done, or of the method of doing it; a systematic statement of rules or principles to be followed" or "A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed." Tell me, which of these two definitions are not inline with the scientific definition?   Irrelevant. I have no interest in arguing the difference in morality between two identical organisms whose inly difference is mental and physical development.   Then this debate isn't for you. Rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are the characteristics that sentient beings are supposed to possess, and this is not exhaustive. The concept of sentience  is  one of the bedrocks of the abortion debate. If you are not willing to address this issue, then you shouldn't even be debating here in the first place.

It is not what you care about. What you think or care about is different from the view of the laws. Selling sex has to do with whether one has the freedom to choose in regards to their body which is however prevented by the laws.  You keep saying that the mother fetus relationship is parasitic but you are still failing to produce proper proof. The first evidence you produced is a blog. Who cares about a blog? Ablog is the exchange of information between people who talks about a subject. In the dictionary the term parasite was defined. Again anyone knows the definition of parasite so prove to me or produce any scientific findings that proved the fetus is a parasite. So far, you have failed to produce any proper evidence to prove that. All you keep doing is defining what the term parasite means and then applying it to the term fetus because of the existing relationship.

The only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt. So why is it foolish? Organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being?   What do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America? Last time i had a conversation with a Judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses. And it is still in practice so where are you living in? In Fantasy America?  It seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey. According to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual, the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity MUST be able to be distinguished from the dead. If this rule exists, then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life.   Abortion again is the taking of a human life. Why do people not want to get pregnant? Because they are unable to accept responsiblity of the unborn for some reason or the other. So it is the process whereby the fetus is killed in a procedure.   If a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage, then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion. For an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not, there has to be intention to commit the action itself.

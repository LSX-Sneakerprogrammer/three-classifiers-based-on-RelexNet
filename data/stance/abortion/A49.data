1. The argument I was trying to make is that the Left seems to be more concerned about saving trees than they are HUMAN BEINGS. Thats another "debate" I guess.  2. OK not an argument here but I would appreciate some clarification...is it empathy or self awareness we are waiting for before we call them human? The reason I am asking is because it was my experience with my son that he almost immediately could sense his mothers emotional state and reacted in kind. He recognized both my wife's and my voice and music that he heard while in the womb.  3. I somewhat agree on this one in that if the birth risks the life of both the mother and the baby then there is no choice. I will admit I would anguish over a decision like that for the rest of my life.  As far as rape goes...while it is certainly not the fault of the mother that it happened to her it is also not the fault of the child.  4. I understand that but remember "when your enemy makes you angry ...they win" Someone really smart and famous said that but for the life of me I cant recall who.  Try not to forget that "facts" and "logic" vary according to each individuals viewpoint and at times, can be subjective both on the right and the left. They are as tired of you quoting science that they dont believe in as your are of them using a book that you dont believe in. Both groups have absolute belief in their sources.  If they are "right wing nuts" let them be....wont that just about make your argument for you? Dad always said that we catch more flies with honey than we do vinegar!

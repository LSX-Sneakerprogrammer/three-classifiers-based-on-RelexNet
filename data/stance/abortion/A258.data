Here's another ad hominem argument for ya:  What's wrong with ad hominem arguments against people like you?   (by "people like you" I mean all those who have nothing original to say other than the same soggy "it's a person, don't commit murder" and have a complete disregard for debating ethics, especially the scoring side of things: example? 100 arguments of the same point scores 100 for the side without actually being 100 arguments).  You can take that home and bank it with the rest of my other ad hominem arguments ;)

Your link is the second step in my argument. I'll get to it soon.   But how...   Simple, the same reason a single sperm or a single egg cell are not human beings.    It seems to me...   Well that's how it seems to you. It seems to me that just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it human.   Just because...   Actually, depending on the stage in the pregnancy, it isn't a human being when the heart isn't beating. Then again, I believe the heart starts beating after it's become a human being during the pregnancy; I'm not exactly sure of the minuet time-frame specifics of most pregnancies.   By that logic...   You're assuming I'm totally pro-abortion, which I am not. My logic is not yet fully explained to you. Very simply, do I believe that fetus in the photo is a human being? Well, I'm fairly sure it is, but I'd need a doctor with a very expensive machine to tell me whether is it or not.

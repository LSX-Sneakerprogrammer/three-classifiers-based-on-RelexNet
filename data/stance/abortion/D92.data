A fetus does not have an informed conscious(at least there is no scientific proof) and thus it could not make a choice of death over adoption or life and thus it means nothing to ask "What choice do you think the unborn babies would make" as this is an appeal to emotion.  Also to complain that governments force people against their religion to pay with their taxes for abortion seems hypocritical and naive. If you don't want government to use your tax dollars for abortions because it is against your religion why should the government support tax breaks for religion and your church? because not everyone follows a particular religion yet they end up paying for it. Also don't forget that some churches of various religions work very hard to impose their doctrine/beliefs on to others of which they have no right.   Also all of your sources are biased towards pro-life where their mission is only to support pro-life so how credible is it?

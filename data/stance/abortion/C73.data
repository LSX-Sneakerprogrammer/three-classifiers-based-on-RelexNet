If my mother had aborted me, I would have no opinion on the matter because I would never have existed.   What an ignorant thought. Of course you would have existed. While you obviously wouldn't realize what was happening, it is still a horrible violation of human rights. Studies have shown again and again that when aborted, the baby is not just a lifeless blob of tissue, it is A LIVING BEING. You jusyt won't accept the evidence. I don't what else must happen to rid you of your foolish thoughts.

Personally, I am in the middle. In cases where either a) upon being born, the fetus will have died or killed the mother or b) when the person became pregnant as a result of rape or sexual assault, abortion is OK. However, people who get pregnant as a result of pure stupidity (not using protection, for example) should not be permitted to abort.

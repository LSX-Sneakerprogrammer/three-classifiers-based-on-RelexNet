When the man has sex with a woman, he knows he is potentially creating a life. He must be prepared to accept whether the woman wants to keep it. It's inside her, not him.   Consider you taking your child over to a neighbour and asks him to babysit the child while you go out for dinner. The neighbour shouldn't have to babysit just because you asked him. He has to look after the child, so he has the choice to do it or not. You are responsible for this child whether he wants to babysit or not.

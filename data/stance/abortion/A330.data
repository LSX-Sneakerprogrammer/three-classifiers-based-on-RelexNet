Your argument fails in that a human who has been born, whether freed or enslaved, is a life in being -- i.e., someone who is an autonomous life fully developed to the point of not being physiologically dependent on another being for basic bodily functions. We recognize that autonomous, born human beings share certain basic rights. These rights do not extend to clumps of cells which are wholly dependent on another living being for their existence. Therefore your analogy does not actually equate at all.

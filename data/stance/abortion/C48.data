Plant cells of a fruit are alive but they are not part of an independent & unique multicellular organism.   So... asexually reproducing life isn't sacred now? In order to be sacred you need different DNA? I never understood that argument, quite frankly and I have heard it before... as if having unique DNA gives you consciousness and individuality.  Fruit cells envelop seeds (usually) and they are alive. The only important difference between them and foetal cells is that foetal cells lack a cell wall. Both a foetus and a fruit if left alone have the potential to grow a new life. In the case of a fruit, the seeds may grow into new trees or shrubs. In the case of a foetus, it may grow into a human. Both have this potential, but they are not presently realised.   This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...   I never said that apples were independent life forms, but when you pick them from the tree they do live on their own apart from it.  Also, if you want to get into the biology of it, the cells which make up your testes are part of an evolved collective of cells, a relationship which evolved over many millions of years. Multicellular life is, in a sense, many cells working together through evolved inter-dependence. So in a historical sense, yes, your testes have cells which are animals (animals need not be multicellular) but which are evolved to be genetically identical and inter-dependent.

It doesn't matter what it could become. It only matters what it is presently.   That is the problem with people like you isnt it?  You don't see the bigger picture.  A human life is a human life period, regardless of developmental stage or cognitive ability.  You remind me of Hitler in fact...he destroyed human beings he did not consider human too....perhaps you will meet him in Hell.....you could be lovers ;)

What separates humans from all other species of this world is language and our ability to reason (to grab from quickly from Wikipedia: "Compared to other living organisms on Earth, humans have a highly developed brain capable of abstract reasoning, language, and introspection."). A fetus can do none of these things. While it certainly in most cases will turn into a being able to reason and communicate, it still is easy to dispute that a fetus is a "human" as we officially define one today. Just something to think about when arguing your point.

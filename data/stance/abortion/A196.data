"You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?"   That's exactly what I think!  Riding a bike without a helmet is not a good comparison when comparing it to sex. Sure, it shows that the consequences could be fatal, but with the case of pregnancy, one life is certainly at risk, and that could easily become two.   "...this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population?"   Again, you are making assumptions, and they are wrong.  I am all for childbirth, it keeps the system moving. I am against overpopulation. I suggest that rather than kill of a mistake, we educate to prevent the mistake from occurring. Overpopulation is way off the point; my point is that childbirth keeps the population where it should be!   "...but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!!!"   Then it is too late.  You have just admitted something that I have stated in a previous argument:  "unprotected sex will become the next underground drug."  And guess what else? Then you see STD's creep back into the problem, in fact, potentially much worse than it was before! And sure, perhaps  some  people will learn, but not  all.   You need to admit that banning unprotected sex is a failing system with too many flaws to test. We need to educate productively if we are going to get anywhere with this problem!

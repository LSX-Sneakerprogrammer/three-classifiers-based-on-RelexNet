You can't be both. You either want abortions legalâ€¦or you want protection for the unborn and want it illegal.   This reveals the simplicity of your thoughts. You can be both. There are good reasons to believe why abortion should only be legal within the first trimester only.   Thats like child abuse.   This is a textbook example of a false analogy. A fetus is not the equivalent of a child.   It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped.   Yes it does. There have been studies of how the children of rape victims are negatively affected in terms of their psychological development, especially if there is a missing parent.   We live in a sexually active society.   We have always lived in a sexually active society. If our society is sexually inactive, the human race would have been extinct by now.   More couples live together today than get married.   I don't see your point. Married couples live together. And you can choose to live together first and get married later. It has no bearing on whether abortion is right or wrong.   We are a sexual society and we celebrate the deviant.   And who is "the deviant"?   Kids know about sex earlier than ever today.   That's good! I'd rather have my kids know about sex earlier and learn how to protect themselves than to be ignorant and cause unwanted pregnancies due to a lack of knowledge.   It is sad that what you morally disagree with you don't have the guts to stand up for.   I can say the same about you. What you are positing here are feeble challenges. So feeble, in fact, I wonder if your heart is even in this debate.

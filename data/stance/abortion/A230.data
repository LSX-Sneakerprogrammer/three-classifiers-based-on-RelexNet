It not whether it's human. We know it's human. We also know that before at least week 20, it cannot survive on its own. It has all the POTENTIAL of a life, but that's only a POTENTIAL. Until it can be kept alive by society without the mother, it's the mother's choice to continue to bring this POTENTIAL life into existence or not.  So the question is "Is it life, or is it potential life?" and the answer is "it's potential life". So then it's in the same category as any egg or sperm on its own.

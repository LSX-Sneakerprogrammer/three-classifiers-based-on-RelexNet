Abortion is purely subjective.  If the woman is having an abortion, clearly she has her reasons.  People shouldn't judge others in general.  Doesn't even matter if your a 15 year old girl or a 28 year old woman, obviously if they were to choose to abort the child they were not ready to be mothers.  As for adopting it out, why would a woman put her self through all the changes and pressure of being pregnant, then not keep the child especially if she knows she is in no way shape or form ready to go through the while experience? However, If that was the main purpose for a woman to get pregnant in the first place, that's a totally different story.   How is it murder? It doesn't even truly exist yet. It hasn't been born into the world. If a woman had the baby then got rid of it, that's murder! NOT when it's still inside of her.

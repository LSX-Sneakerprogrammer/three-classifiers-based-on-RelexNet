even if you had an emotional past or some effect that leads to having abortion, honestly the baby did not do anything to you. what happened to you should not have killed the baby. you call yourself human. taking a life is nothing to go on living or smiling about, and then how could you even begin to wake up everyday knowing you took your own baby's life   A couple critical points:  This    http://blog.bioethics.net/baby.jpg   Is not equal to this   http://www.typicallyspanish.com/spain/ uploads/1/foetus.jpg    Or this   http://topnews.net.nz/images/Embryo.gif   A baby is not a foetus or an embryo. The words are not interchangeable. When a woman is pregnant, a baby isn't sitting in her womb for nine months already developed. Calling it a baby is a way to emotionally hijack the topic. It's like calling hamburgers "puppies" in order to make us vegetarians.  Second point: A foetus is not a life. It hasn't lived in the outside world yet and formed an identity.

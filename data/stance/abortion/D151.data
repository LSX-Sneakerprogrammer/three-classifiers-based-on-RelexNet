Also consider, that humans are the only species on earth that have 46 chromosomes in our DNA structure. This DNA structure is truly what sets us apart from other species. 23 chromosomes are found in the sperm, and 23 in the egg. At the exact moment of conception those 23 come together to make 46, detailing not only that they are human, but who they will be. At the exact moment of conception, they are a human life, and no longer a couple of cells.  Are you suggesting that we should have the right to kill any person who is not capable of abstract reasoning, language or introspection?

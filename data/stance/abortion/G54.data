So are you saying that because someone is not responsible to raise a child, we should kill that child? A human being with life? We keep thinking about the body of the mother but let us also think about the body of the unborn. So for every woman that is not ready, we should kill the child because of the foolishness of their actions? You are a human being and let us put it this way, would you want to pay for the mistake of someone whilst you are innocent?

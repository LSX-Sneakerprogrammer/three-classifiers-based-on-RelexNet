You know, this is actually a common thread amongst conservatives, especially the fundamentalists.   Is it really? How fascinating    For example, they are against HPV and HIV vaccines and cures because they believe these diseases are deserved punishments for (in their view) immoral behaviour. They are against contraception because that removes the consequences they believe ought to follow from sex out of wedlock. They are against abortion because an unexpected newborn to them is some form of life lesson for (in their view) immoral behaviour and it is essentially punishment.   Yes personal responsibility is a terrible thing...something we should never expect of anyone...   I set the ethical cut-off point at birth for the sake of convenience.   How subjectively arbitrary, you think your opinion here gives weight to your argument? Interesting.   Murder is the unauthorised (illegal) killing of an individual. A foetus is not an individual (it has no sense of self or identity caused by unique memories), and it is not illegal to kill them. Therefore it is not murder.   Semantics, depends which nation you live in.  OK Abortion is killing, pure and simple...  Have I seen a foetus?  What a seemingly stupid question...what relevance is that?  Please elucidate.

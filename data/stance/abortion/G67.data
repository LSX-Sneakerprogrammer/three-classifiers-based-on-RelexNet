Most abortions that occur are before it is even a foetus. The second most likely stage aborted is that in which the foetus is barely developed, barely has a brain and only might have a heart.  The figures are roughly 50% and 30% respectively.  I support abortion because we need mothers who want their child and are prepared to raise it well. What we do NOT need are unprepared, overworked mothers giving their babies to an already flooded adoption market, or attempting to raise a child that gets less than optimal care because the mother can't be there for him.

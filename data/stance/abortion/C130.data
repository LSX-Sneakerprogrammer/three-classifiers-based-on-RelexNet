Let's start with a crude reality just to set the tone, shall we? We already have enough people, and I could do without some living ones as it is.  -  Now let's go to the more accepted question in this debate, "when does life begin?" Well, to me, I cannot claim I was alive before I was consiously able to recognize it. This is not to say I wasn't, but it is to say there is an indeterminate level of ambiguity. To what range varies from person to person. Those that claim to know when life begins are ignorant to this reality. Thereby, we shall not instate laws against an amorphous concept.

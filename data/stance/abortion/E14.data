i believe so. the very fact that abortion has been put it shows that there is a need for it. the various circumstances of the individuals requiring abortion differs greatly; a young couple having made a mistake, a couple with financial problems and cannot cope with another child, rape victims, the list goes on. while there are circumstances when one does not deserve to have an abortion, but the child that is born will suffer the consequences of its parents mistakes. Banning abortion is like imposing the death sentence on youths using drugs.

That is NOT my reasoning.   I do not believe that you were trying to argue that wasting sperm is the same as wasting life, however I was taking your argument about potential life to its absurd logical conclusion.   I have some tests coming up so i won't respond immediately perhaps this weekend I'll write something up summarizing my position.   I look forward to reading it.   My responses have been criticisms of the argument from sapience you have been making, not a argument for or against abortion themselves.   I made note of this, however I hope you realise, along with those making the argument, that it is an inherently grey issue.

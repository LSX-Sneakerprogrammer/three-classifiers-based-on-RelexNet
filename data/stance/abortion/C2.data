Funny, I would say since the baby hasn't done anything to you, you shouldn't subjugate it to a life of loneliness and misery. There are already enough unloved orphans in the world, why bring in another?  If I had to choose, I would rather my life be ended as a fetus so I can go find another body to live in, perhaps one with a mother whom would want me for a reason greater than guilt. A reason like  love .

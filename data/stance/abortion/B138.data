..and you think its ok to just kill it for no reason.    I think you should go back and see if I said it is okay to kill a bay in the womb for no reason. Just to have fun or if killing someone makes you happy. Did I tell that anywhere? No..    Could you make a list....?   The fetus is poisoned.   The pregnancy goes wrong.  Either the mother or the baby can be saved.   99% are for social reasons,   I wasn't here to defend myself, but I told you I'm not 'for' such abortions. They must be stopped.   It is sad that you do not value the life in the womb.   I'll tell you what is sadder. It is sad that you do not wanna see the other side of the possibilities. Why abortions are sometimes important. You might believe just right out that I have no value for life in the womb. I don't think you can just say that cuz you call yourself pro-life. Value must exist. For life inside the womb and outside.   I've been telling you constantly that I'm just trying to explain that I do agree with some of your thoughts, just not all. There must be exceptions. Not easy, but essential one's. You cannot tighten the rules so hard that the humanity you are fighting for has no easy solution.

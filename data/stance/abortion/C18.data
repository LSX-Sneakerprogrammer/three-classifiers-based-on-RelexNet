how can you compare a spider to a human life! a spider is not creative, a spider is not capable of love or emotion, a spider is not very productive, and a spider is an insect not a human. plus a fudus if you want to call it that does have a mind or else it would not be able to curl its toes and suck it's thumb nor would it be able to grow!

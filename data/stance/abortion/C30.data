That is your subjective opinion, I on the other hand disagree.  I think my 'lesson' is entirely valid...personal responsibility is very important.   Then you are psychotic.   What law, of which nation?  Besides laws can be changed.   The United States.   An apple is a fruit and is not a multi cellular organism, such as a human foetus.   Apples are multicellular. They are communities of plant cells. They are living organisms.   I do not kill human foetuses everyday and that is what we are discussing..not apples or plums or oranges...LOL   I have as much emotion for a foetus dying as an apple or plum being consumed. They are on the same level of self-awareness (or lack thereof).

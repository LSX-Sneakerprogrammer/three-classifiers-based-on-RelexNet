Reality check required? Is your statement an argument or a personal attack?  Clearly you are indeed a fool if you believe that I am suggesting an imediate termination and outlaw on abortion. I, as many do, believe that we can work towards the issue, rather than circling it as people like you do.  Who do you defend with your outrageous suggestions? The mother? From what exactly?  The point of it all is to prevent an unwanted prenancy, we can agree on that.  You suggest terminating part of the problem, I suggest that we create a solution to the entire situation.  And, yeah, that reality check I mentioned, it may very well be overdue.

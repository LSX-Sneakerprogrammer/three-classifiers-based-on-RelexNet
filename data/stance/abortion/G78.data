Really? Give me one reason why? So are you implying that when you were in the womb of your mother you were unworthy of human rights? We are talking about the "life of a developing human being for your information". Why don't you save me some time and read up on that historic case i made reference to? For your information again we are talking about the cells of the sperm and zygote which when fuse brings about the reproduction of a developing human being. Furthermore scientifically the fetus is referred to as a human organism. Define the term organism for me?  That statement you made is full of arrogance and wrongful judgment. Many of my friends who were born out of poverty or unpreparedness are now successful lawyers, doctors, singers etc? Would you say that they should have been killed as a child too. That does not make any sense at all.

Why won't this debate just die?  1. That cluster of cells no matter what you call it is not a person. It has no feelings, no self-awareness, it's an amoeba, no more alive than a tumor. Science has confirmed this, and I care not what the religious right's fevered imagination is telling them - they talk to dead people for christ's sake. Settled. It's not an argument, it is agreed by all sensible people that that cluster of cells is in no way hurt by the procedure.  2.  If  one is ridiculous enough to argue potential life, I would point out that every time I or any male cums there are approximately 2000 "potential lives" - and by the logic of potential life, we should all bottle our sperm and save our eggs and inject every last one so there are a trillion trillion bastards running around by 2020. It is the exact same argument, hence you obviously have no argument if that is your stance.  3. There are too many goddamn idiots having goddamn kids who themselves are going to be goddamn idiots. Of every human I know in any capacity, only the stupidest of them have multiple kids, and I'm in my early 30's, I know a lot of stupid people with stupid kids. Not only am I not against abortion, I'm an abortion fan!     4. Pretend for a second that you magically make abortion illegal... pretend an angel or Jesus or the tooth fairy comes down and makes it so... then what? Not in the history of the human race has making abortion illegal ever  EVER  stopped someone from having an abortion.  The only thing it does is drive a bunch of young girls with their whole lives ahead of them into dirty basements to get the procedure where they may or may not get out alive.  Humans need abortion, and humans need a safe and legal way of getting the procedure done.   If  you  don't want an abortion  you  don't have to have one. It has exactly 0 to do with anyone else on earth.

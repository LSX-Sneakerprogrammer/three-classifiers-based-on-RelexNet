I like how you've become more radical with your ideas :)   Most great ideas are radical, but there's a downside: You have to be prepared to defend it from those who don't like radical ideas. You'll also need to refine this idea to make it workable and more convincing.    Something like this might work better : Keep abortions legal and well regulated but make it expensive, effectively imposing a monetary fine on unwanted pregnancies, a jail term may be considered to further deter unwanted pregnancies. Over time, this program will be just like the introduction of seatbelts in cars, people will no longer need to be reminded to avoid unwanted pregnancies, effectively eliminating abortions.

in what universe is it acceptable for me to put my own personal desires ahead of that of the other life?   In the universe that states that human life begins at birth, not conception, as science as stated time and time again.   Do you call an acorn a tree? Why not?  Do you call an egg a chicken? Why not?  A sac of cells, however inconveniently conveying what you like to think are human characteristics (arms, legs, face, eye sockets, etc.), is not, in any way a human or anything close to it. A fetus is called just that for a reason; it is not a human.   Your stupidity is probably, and most unfortunately, fueled by some sort of religious idea. If not, then it's fueled by a simple misunderstanding of when life begins.  I always took you for someone of a higher intelligence.

Yes, but  why ? In your post on my "Why is killing wrong?" debate, you said killing is wrong because it damages the group and because it causes pain. Neither of those apply when killing non-intelligent life.  As for where we draw the line, for the purposes of this debate, let's draw it at any non-zero intelligence. That is, if there's any intellectual capacity at all, killing the person is wrong. So killing a week-old clump of cells is ok, killing somebody who is completely brain-dead is ok, killing anybody else is not ok.

Wrong. It is because of the people living in this land who saw it as being wrong gave government that right and they also gave government the right to make abortion illegal until the Supreme Court decided that the state had no right to intervene and made their decision based on a lie. I do not think the Court had the authority to make that decsion becasue it was the majority of people who conferred that right upon the state and not the Court.  How can you compare a fetus DNA with a parasite DNA? Are parasites or bacterias from the human race? I never know that the human race can also be a parasite? Can it? The DNA of a fetus is fromed from the Chromosomes of the mother and father which posess a different but unique DNA. Oh and by the way does parasites and bacterias has a unique but different blood type also?

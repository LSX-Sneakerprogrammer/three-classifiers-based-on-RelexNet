Religion can't be your argument, since it hinges on what people believe and some believe in choice.  When you say "women", you generalize and include all females, but some women, again, prefer a choice.  I've said it plenty of times and I'll say it again, a fetus before it can survive outside of the mother's womb is a POTENTIAL life, which is the same as an independent egg or sperm and anything else in between.

Lets make this quick.   "Educating teens about sex only enhances their sex drive"  Worlds most spurious argument? You have absolutely zero evidence to support that statement. You can’t honestly believe a bunch of diagrams on penises and how babies are made can incite sexual fantasies! Teens are naturally sexual, it’s called puberty which answers my next point.  "At the age of 11 at that"  You hadn't even hit puberty so no wonder you weren’t thinking about sex. I’m just glad sex-ed kicked in before the hormones. Think about this, do you think it benefits society to keep kids totally in the dark about sex till there an adult or to educate them about the right and wrong way to have sex.  "We learn in school that its ok to have sex - as long as you love them. "  Yes what the teachers are told you are purely opinion based and I believe should be left for the parents.  "Which is wrong because it will always lead to promiscuity."  That’s foolish, again no evidence for this proclamation. Promiscuity is a much sensationalized word and it always used in a bad light. However it is just a word to describe a human’s need for sexual gratification. What they are saying totally makes sense, if you love someone and sleep with them, you aren’t as likely to go out and cheat on them.  Promiscuous: characterized by or involving indiscriminate mingling or association, esp. having sexual relations with a number of partners on a casual basis.   If your teachers say you should love the person you’re sleeping with then they are discouraging promiscuity...........  "People should learn from their mistakes."  Mate I totally agree with you on that one but what I was saying before was that society won’t help our teen parents with that kind of attitude. They should be supporting them instead.   "Doesn’t actually deter me from crime and would surely ruin my life in the long run as getting a job"  Obviously you can’t deter someone from a crime they have already committed... It is clear that a teenager finding out she is pregnant is the most devastating news; it is life changing. I highly doubt she would go off and do it again, not till she is ready.

There's just so many things wrong with your post... let's list them. ;)  1. I agree, human life is not something to ditch. Better it be aborted first.  2. On this issue, she's as wrong as possible  3. The bible is garbage. I would sooner trust my arguments to logic than some dogmatic fiction novel. If you had any intelligence, you would do the same.  4. We aren't a race, we're a species. Unless you're trying to say that it's only wrong for one race to get abortions... XD   5. "Sorry nation" is a non-cognitive opinion, therefore has no base in reality.  6. There is no shortage of orphans. Parents wanting children but can't conceive can easily adopt if they want to any time. Your argument is moot.  7. No, you're just egotistical and assume everything you personally don't approve of is your business.  8. There were no "toes" being stepped on. She made a logical error and I corrected her.   Wow, literally every sentence in your post made some kind of fallacy. Some even made two.   That. Is. Hilarious. ;)

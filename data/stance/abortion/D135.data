I didn't say anything about ignoring science when creating laws. However, I asked why should we let it have a role. Ah, I see, b/c science is proven. Why is it proven? Ah, b/c science says so. In essence, your position is not much different then the religious fanatic, a complete reliance on your senses as opposed to complete reliance on an idea. You trust that your senses are all there is in this world. Many don't. And science doesn't prove that the natural is the only thing, it only can speak about the natural.   Besides, every law isn't based on a "proven theory". I'm not allowed to steal from you. What does that have to do w/science?  Thankfully, I'm not one of those who think this nation was founded as a Christian Nation. However, I certainly know a bit about those founding fathers, and know they certainly believed in a Creator, and that belief influenced the founding of this country.

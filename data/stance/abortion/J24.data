BUT you never know, that baby that was aborted could have been the next president or maybe the next singer everyone talks about.   Then again, is that a good argument? I could easily flip that around and say, "Thank goodness person A aborted that baby because the baby that was aborted could have been the next Hitler, Pol Pot or Stalin or maybe the next Captain Francesco Schettino that everyone talks about." The problem with such an argument is that we simply  do not  know what  might  or might  not  happen.

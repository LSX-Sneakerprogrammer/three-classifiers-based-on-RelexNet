Having an abortion is just pure selfishness, it is is as simple as that. Women make a choice themselves to have sex, and then play god and decide if the child can live or die, making such invalid comments as "its my body its my choice" not realizing that it is not just about them anymore.   Selfishless is not illegal, nor should it be.  The fetus  is  making its home inside the mother's body, thus the choice of its continued residence there should not fall to anyone else but her. I am sure you enjoy being able to decide what medical procedures are performed or not performed on your body.   Is a plant not alive simply because it cannot speak? is a microscopic plankton not alive simply because you cannot see it with the naked eye? no. It is as alive as you are.    If abortion is immoral because the fetus is alive, and all things are equally alive, then abortion is the same as uprooting a weed.    There is no reason for abortion when there are so many people out there who cannot have children themselves.   Foregoing an abortion does not cure the infertility of strangers.   If a women does not care enough for this child, that she wishes to abort it, then it cannot be hard for her to carry this child and give it to somebody who would love it.   There is no shortage of existing children who do not have homes. There is no reason to add to the number.  I am going to guess you have never seriously considered what it might be like to be  forced  to be pregnant based on what someone else thinks you are allowed to do with your body.   If somebody tried to decide for you, whether you could live or die, you would be angry, that is not a choice they are allowed to make, and it should never be a choice for woman.   No, I wouldn't. If I was a fetus, I would be incapable of anger. If I was conscious, as I am now, I certainly wouldn't be happy, but I would never make another human function as a life support system for me.

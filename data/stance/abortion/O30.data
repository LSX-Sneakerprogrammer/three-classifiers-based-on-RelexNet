I suppose some conjoined twins should be able to kill each other at will with impunity...   Should parents have the right to kill their infants, toddlers, teenagers and etc because parents must labor(perhaps at an unenjoyable job) for their children? What about the children's physical autonomy?  Once you die, you stop having an "ongoing" permission, I find it difficult to support, other than by principle, not having mandatory organ donations.   Although, I think your dispute is about mandatory organ donations from the living. In this case, it is a conflict between two people and each of their's physical autonomy, it isn't a degradation of physical autonomy in favor of something else. Rather, if mandatory organ donations from the living were passed into law, the goverment would be saying that the sick has a greater physical autonomy than the healthy.

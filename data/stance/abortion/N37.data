Life is defined scientifically as any organism containing most or all of the following qualities:  1. Homeostasis - regulation of internal environment  2. Organization - composed of one or more structured cells  3. Metabolism - able to transform food into energy and use it  4. Growth - increasing in size or complexity  5. Adaptation - ability to change over time in response to environment  6. Response to stimuli - reacting to outside objects (recoiling when poked, etc)  7. Reproduction - ability to produce more organisms  From the moment of conception, the new cell has all of these attributes. It fits into the definition of life.  The new cell also has a unique genetic code not found in the mother.  Therefore, given the definition of life and the fact that the new life has a differing genetic code from its mother we can conclude that it is a separate human being in early stages of development. As a separate human being it has the same worth and rights as any other human being.  If this is true no other arguments matter. Size, stage of growth (children are less developed than adults, are they less than human?), and location do not matter at all. If it is an individual human being, it has all the rights and protections of all other human beings. Killing this life is tantamount to murder.

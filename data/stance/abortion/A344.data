Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thing   Never said it was, only the logic behind it. Here is an example:   It is the mother's property   FYI that's the same logic that was used to justify the beating of slaves; it was the slave master's property.   You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself.     That's called discrimination on the basis of level of dependency. Should I discriminate against you because you are dependent on the local grocery store to get your milk? I think not, that would be wrong.  And finally, did you forget what we are talking about here? We are talking about a human being.

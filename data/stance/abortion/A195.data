You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?  Just compare it with many other things that are illegal: riding a bike without helmet, not wearing a seatbelt in a car. Most of the time, the cops don't know if you're wearing your seatbelt or not! But they certainly would know if you crashed your car!!! So if unprotected sex is made illegal (outside of a committed relationship) people can risk it if they want, but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!!! Then you'd be fined lots of money, or the fine should be built into the cost of an abortion!!! That should be a deterent, wouldn't you say? Eventually people will learn that it's not good to have unprotected sex, they won't have to be told any more. Like wearing a seatbelt in a car, it's become second nature to people now.  "Promoting childbirth"? I'm sorry but this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population? That's just dictatorship, pure and simple. You want more people, so you force people to give birth? Go live in a country run by a dictatorship, that's should suit you perfectly.

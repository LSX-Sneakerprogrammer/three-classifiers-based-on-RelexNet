"Why should eliminating someone's chance at life be an option just because it's CONVENIENT for the woman?"  Because it's part of the woman until birth.   "If people are going to choose to do something, they need to take responsibility for their actions."  You are not one to judge what is the correct way of taking responsibility.   I'd argue more but you don't go anywhere beyond the whole "life deserves a chance" stance. You say you read into both sides but I don't believe that as I see no reference to the societal benefits of abortion in your response.

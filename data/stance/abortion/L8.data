With so many excruciatingly painful situations throughout the world that need our immediate attentions, abortion is so far down the list as not to be anything for me to consider. One exception: I would favor legislating against abortion after the 4th or 5th month of pregnancy. However, even in such cases, under certain circumstances and in timely fashion, such a law would be made circumventable.  I would suggest that we spend more time, effort, and resources looking after those humans we already have on board. Get behind the abolishment of war--or in more understandable terms--WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER!!  The abortion issue is for the most part a religious issue and I subscribe to no man's dogma much less its abject hypocrisy.

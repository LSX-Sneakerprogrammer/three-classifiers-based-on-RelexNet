I'm against abortions for the most part; I don't believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control as with upwards of 80% of the cases. There are ways to prevent pregnancy which are very effective and to me if a person ignores the use of birth control they should assume responsibility for their actions.  On the other hand, there are many instances where birth control has failed, cannot be taken due to allergies, or where rape is a contributing factor to where I would support a womanâ€™s decision if she where to not go through with the pregnancy.  As for not being able to sustain a baby financially, emotionally, or intellectually, adoption is an option, saying that you want to abort because you didn't  feel  like taking or wearing birth control is a poor excuse and shouldn't be encouraged or supported.

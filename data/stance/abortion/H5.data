well, it is a bad decision to have abortion. even if you had an emotional past or some effect that leads to having abortion, honestly the baby did not do anything to you. what happened to you should not have killed the baby. you call yourself human. taking a life is nothing to go on living or smiling about, and then how could you even begin to wake up everyday knowing you took your own baby's life.. it is cruel and such an evil thing to do.. and i am pretty sure its not our body but in soul were all connected and we never said it was ours to begin with.. your babies are human and deserved to be loved also.. how will they ever know if you end their lives.

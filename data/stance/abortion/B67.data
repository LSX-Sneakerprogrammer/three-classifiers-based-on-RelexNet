First off, I would like to remind everyone that this debate involves the morality of abortion, not the legality of abortion. Those two topics are completely different, especially since the legal system is not set up to be a perfect morality emulator.   A fetus does not have the right to life as long as it is nothing more than a product of its mother and father. When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.  Regardless, abortion is typically always a tough decision for every woman. Many find it to not be the most moral of decisions, but it is usually found to be the right decision.

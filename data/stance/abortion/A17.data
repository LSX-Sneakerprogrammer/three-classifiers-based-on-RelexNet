You are incorrect in stating, "if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide." You would only be charged with two counts of homicide if the prosecution can prove the baby could have survived outside of the womb. If a doctor were to provide an abortion after 24 weeks, he or she would also be charged with homicide (unless the baby would not have been viable or was a threat to the health of the mother).

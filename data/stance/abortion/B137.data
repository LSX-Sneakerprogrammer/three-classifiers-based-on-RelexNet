It is a living human being...and you think its ok to just kill it for no reason. Wow.   When or what excuses are ok to kill the unborn. Could you make a list....?  If you go to Alan Guttmaucher and look up the reasons why women abort...99% are for social reasons, they have NOTHING to do with HEALTH issues.   It is sad that you do not value the life in the womb.

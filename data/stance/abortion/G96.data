Do you think abortion is going to make people more responsible.   Exactly where in my post did I write anything that sounded even remotely like this???   I am not just out here throwing stuff because i want to.    Hmm... didn't say anything about this either. =/   I am here because i believe it is wrong.   Always a great way to justify a position. =/   Do you want to know how abortion came into effect?   No. I don't care. Not even a little bit.  But since you went through the trouble of telling me anyway... nope, still don't care. =/   This is debating not about silly preferences.   No, you're debating about your silly preferences. Not getting an abortion is your preference and you're debating about it, also it is silly. Therefore, you are debating about your silly preferences.    If it was would it be a national controversy?   Ah, you're right. There's no way something could be both stupid AND controversial...   Would you say that to a District Attorney that he is childish because of what he believes in too?   Would you say to a pregnant mother that she must keep her unwanted child because YOUR morality dictates it?  Really, what's with the appeal to authority sayyad? Do you think I care what some hypothetical district attorney thinks? Do you think a district attorney can't be stupid?

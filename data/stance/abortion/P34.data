Honestly, your statement is both unintelligible and unintelligent.   No his statement wasn't. You just disagree with it. If you think that being insulting is a fitting way to encourage in depth reasoning you are to say the least mistaken.   What are you saying here? Are you actually suggesting that the baby has a choice in the matter?   How in the world would you come up with that based on what he typed? Silas mistakenly thought it would be obvious (and it was to me but apparently not to you) that he was talking about adoption being a superior choice to abortion. Do a poll at the site and I bet most people would agree that YOU missed the OBVIOUS here in your rush to ridicule.   An unjustified assertion.   He did too justify it. He presented an alternative that doesn't involve an unnecessary surgery and in which the life of the developing child is cherished instead of treated like trash.

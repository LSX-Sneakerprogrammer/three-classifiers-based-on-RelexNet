No his statement wasn't. You just disagree with it.   It is both.   Silas mistakenly thought it would be obvious (and it was to me but apparently not to you) that he was talking about adoption being a superior choice to abortion.   That is obviously a hasty generalisation. I would think that in many cases, babies born with fatal birth defects or, at least, defects that can tragically affect their lives (such as cerebral palsy) will not experience an alleviation of their pain and suffering no matter who their parents are. How can you say that I am rushing to ridicule when you haven't even seen my perspective on this issue?   He presented an alternative that doesn't involve an unnecessary surgery and in which the life of the developing child is cherished instead of treated like trash.   Now, you have made a few unjustified assertions. You have claimed that abortion is an "unnecessary" surgery. You have also claimed that parents treat the life of their developing child like trash. Both of these claims are unasserted.

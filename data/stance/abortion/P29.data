I'm not for making abortion illegal, but I am for legislation to discourage medical professionals from performing unnecessary medical procedures on pregnant women that result in the death of the developing fetus. So I will argue for Silaswash...since I guess he bailed.   people (the mother) should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.   It could be argued that it harms the public in general, by  1. Wasting valuable medical resources on unnecessary procedures  2. Encouraging indiscriminate sex  3. Promoting a culture of irresponsibility  It could mentally harm a father who had no choice but to bear the thought of his offspring being killed in it's most vulnerable state before it even had a chance.   fetuses do not gain moral agency until the onset of the third trimester (the point when basic brain activity and consciousness is possible).   Moral agency! people don't get moral agency until they are old enough to experience regret. People who don't yet have moral agency still deserve legal protection.   The reason why this point is the moment of moral agency is because moral agency can only be justifiably attributed to value attributing agents.   So how would you say a developing baby at the onset of the third trimester all of the sudden starts attributing value? Desperate attempts to justify the unnecessary killing of a fetus are invariably the result of such poor stretches of logic.   Because, prior to this, the fetus is not an agent, morality doesnt apply, the fetus has no sovereignty since sovereignty is determined by the awareness of self.    Morality applies any time an ugly and regrettable thing like an unnecessary abortion is performed.   The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body.   So when do the father's rights to protect his developing child kick in?

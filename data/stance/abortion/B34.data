Funny that for hundreds of years abortion was considered murder. Even today if a woman kills or tries to kill her unborn she can be tried. And if someone else kills or tries, they can be prosecuted and go to prison. Scott Peterson...killed that which you say is not a person that deserved to live.   You talk about body sovereignty......then you cant ever take it away...which means you are for allowing late term abortions. You certainly would not want to enslave the woman carrying a nine month old unborn that she decided to kill at the last minute.   Right?

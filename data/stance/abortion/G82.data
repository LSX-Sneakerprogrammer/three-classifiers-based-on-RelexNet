I did not intentionally banned him. Sorry about that. I dont ban people unless you start name calling and shift from public argument to personal argument. I mistook his name for the guy i wanted to ban. Why would i want to ban people that would give their opinions but anyway lets focus on your argument now.  Oh i was unprepared? Maybe you should have a look at our arguments and if i was unprepared for him, then how come i add him as my ally? I am not going to repeat myself because like i told aveske if the fetus is not a human then what is it? And doctors and the U.S Supreme Court has ruled that the fetus has life. I have proof of this. Lastly aveske referred to the fetus as a human organism. The deeper scientific meaning of the word organism refers to life so he himself referred to the fetus as human life.  And lastly if you read my arguments you would know that i debated this topic 10 times already and you would have learnt i am a student in criminal law.

Yes it is true that abortion is immorally wrong. However, one must think about what will happen if abortion is banned. If something is banned, is it completely gone? Look at prohibition in the 20's and look at weed now. They were never gone, just made illegal. If abortion is illegal then someone who made a mistake in having sex, such as a teen, can't tell anyone about it for obvious reasons. The only person she tells is a best friend and she can't have the baby because the parents will find out so her only option is abortion. OH WAIT! Abortion is illegal so she has to go to some old lady in the trailer park or do it herself with a coat hangar, either way she will end up with a disease (that I can't remember the name). Abortion is wrong but should not be illegal.  Also, I really don't want to sound mean or offensive but this probably is: Abortion will help with population control. Our world's population is increasing faster than ever. we need to keep our resources. And the main people that want abortions are usually careless people or rape victims. Most families would either be able to take care of the child or be courteous enough to put the baby up for adoption. So I guess it really all comes down to practicing safe sex and coming down harder on rapists.

Ugh, whenever I go into an abortion debate it gives me the distinct feeling of going to war.  Anyway, I am pro choice, because I think if you force the woman to have a child you should cut the pretense and just shove a baby-sized object up there without her consent. Roughly the same trauma and pain would be delivered except without the finiancial damage to go along with it.  I rank most orphanages as somewhere within the 9th ring of hell, at least the ones I have visisted, so adoption would just be meaner to the "life".  Besides, let's throw a little bit of perspective. An egg in a woman's body is always there, always waiting, and is flushed out once a month and replaced with another one. That egg is potential for life. Conception conshmeption, all the eggs are potential humans. Same for sperm (Which means I must have a higher death count than Adolf Hitler).  Now, as for fetus-is-life arguement, let's look again. See a picture of a fetus, then see a picture of a baby, or normal human. The fetus has almost no mental nor emotional functions. It's brain is not even fully developed. Even dogs can claim that their brains are fully developed. It's body is not fully developed for life outside the womb either. Until it's able to claim a basically developed human body with a basically developed human mind, it's not human (third trimester being included).  Unless you are ready to take in that unwanted child, feed it, raise it, and let it be its own person, or providing the necessary money and support to do so, do not say you are "protecting" life. Saving someone from being murdered is protecting life. Giving money to the homeless so they can buy something to eat is protecting life. Signing a petition saying women should be forced to live with their mistakes (not even theirs if it's rape) is not protecting life.

Contrary to popular belief Roe v. Wade never legalized abortion. It stated that until the fetus became viable to live on it's own if it was taken out of the woman that her right to privacy outweighed the state's interest in the protection of life. It also stated that until the child is born it is in effect outside the jurisdiction of the United States and therefore NOT entitled to protections offered to citizens of the United States. The only protection that could be offered to the fetus was in a manner that servered the state's intrest while protection the privacy of the woman. (in other words the fetus had no rights and the ablity of the state to interfer with pregenacy was limited in the absolute extreme)  By legalizing abortion you are, in effect, giving the government jurisdiction inside your body. I for one think that government has no right inside a person's body.  Keep the current rule that abortion is neither legal nor illegal becuase it's outside the juristiction of the goverment. Keep a person's body soverign to themselfs only.

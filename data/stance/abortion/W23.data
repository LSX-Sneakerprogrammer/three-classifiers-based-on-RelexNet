You do make a valid point there, but I feel like the "pain" involved could be considered spiritual pain or even emotional pain to the mother. I believe we all have souls, completely independent of religion. And at conception, that little tiny zygote has a soul. Our souls define who we are and I think it's immoral to destroy a life with an innocent soul. In the other debate I only really mention the adverse effects of killing in a physical sense. That;s because when I think of the word kill, I immediately think of murdering an adult and I suppose those reasons are the reasons why many animals do not kill their own species.  Besides, aborting a baby at any stage is not acceptable, by my standards, because the mother (or whomever decided to abort) is not giving that baby a chance at life. Who knows whether or not that baby could have become the next Albert Einstein or the next Adolf Hitler.   All I know is that it does cause pain. I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting. Is that not pain? And if you think about it, it does damage the population. With the populations we have, each abortion does not have a huge impact, but each one takes away a genetically unique individual. This decreases genetic variation in the gene pool.

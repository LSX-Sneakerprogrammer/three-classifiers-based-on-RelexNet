//It is the taking of a human life however you try to spin it.//  Same thing happens whenever I shed my skin cells, too. It's taking human life however you try to spin it.  //Everything happens for a reason;//  How do you know? What's your proof?  //the baby should not suffer because of the mistakes of the parents.//  Are we talking about abortion here? "Baby" is usually after a completed gestation. No babies are harmed during an average abortion.  //Most abortions that take place in America are cases of convenience, which is clearly wrong!//  This is subjective, you think it's wrong, but I don't which is why morality does not make law.  //I do understand that cases of rape or medical necessity are more difficult and cannot be black and white.//  Ah, then you understand that allowing it for even minimal certain circumstances makes you pro-choice, right?  //I have compassion for these mothers and feel for their situations.//  If you did, you would support THEIR choice and not tell them how to use their bodies.  //Adoption is a great alternative!//  Adoption is only an alternative for an unwanted child, but it does nothing for an unintended pregnancy! The only options available are to remain or not remain pregnant. How does adoption factor into this when pregnancy is over??

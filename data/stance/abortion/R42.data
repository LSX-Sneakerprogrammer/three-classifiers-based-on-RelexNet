OK first off Abortion IS murder weather you believe it or not it IS.  Example:   Scott Peterson in trial was convicted of TWO murders not ONE but TWO why two though?  He just killed his wife?  His wife was pregnant. The baby inside of his wife was killed in the process of the mother being killed.  If the supreme court agrees with abortions yet charge Peterson with two murders what are they thinking?!  Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human "spirit" or "soul" inside of it (for those who are religious).  So if you were to "dispose" of this body that IS alive and has a human "soul" within it isn't it the same as murder?  Your taking away the life of some creature that has not yet experienced life yet.  The baby moves, blinks, kicks, and squirms inside the mother, this is the sign that it is alive and is capable of understanding of what is doing (not of everything its doing) and human beings do just the same.   So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.   And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person. Then, put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out.  Is this murder?   Some people will say "Oh well, that isn't the same. That person is fully developed and eduacated"  There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother.  Weather it's there choice or not to get the abortion it IS still murder.  People should understand the consequences of having sex and abortion should not be a option. It leads to people saying "Oh I can just get it aborted so I don't have to worry about it." &lt;- LAZINESS.  We already have enough lazy citizens in the US I don't think we need anymore.

The offspring of the corrupted will also be corrupted. The flood for example every one was corrupt except Noah and his family. Sodom and Gomorrah God gave Abraham to find righteous people the number lowered until finally God said find 10 righteous people Abraham could not and so was the destruction of the cities. Before the cities were destroyed God sent and Angel to worn the righteous people which was only lot and his family which still were not to righteous but they were righteous enough that they listened to the Angel and left. These are only a 2 examples.

I think abortion should be banned because if they didn't want the baby in the first place they shouldn't have opened their legs, should've used a condom, started birth control, used spermicide, etc. There are many other options such as giving the baby up for adoption! If you don't understand they are killing the baby while the baby is still alive and forming. The baby can move, feel, cry, etc. Why would you want to kill a innocent child? That's so wrong.

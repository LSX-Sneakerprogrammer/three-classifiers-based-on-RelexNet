It seems to me that both sides of this topic tend to be unreasonable. Many pro-lifers go so far as to assert that the morning after pill is murder, which is ludicrous. On the other hand, some pro-choice groups don't want any restrictions on abortion, which is equally ludicrous.   I am trying to have an open mind, so my question for the pro-choice group is, should there be any restrictions on abortion at all? Should we (the people) allow a woman to decide she doesn't want her child as it is coming down the birth canal at 9 months?

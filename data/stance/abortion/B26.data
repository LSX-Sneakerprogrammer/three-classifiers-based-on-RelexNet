Abortion is taking the life of a living human being. We see society up in arms about animal rights and animal abuse. Isn't abortion really the worst case of child abuse you can think of? Every abortionists task is to dismember, kill in any way possible...the living human child in the womb. Death is the only goal. The fetus might be small but nevertheless science says it is human and it is alive. What is it called when you take someones life without their permission? Isn't this murder? If you defend the womans choice to kill saying it is her choice....then should you enslave her by putting restrictions on when the killing takes place? Thus late term abortions should be legal if you are pro-abortion. When does her right to body sovereignty end?   I am all for the right of women to choose but when that choice kills another living human being that right should not exist. The living human growing inside her body is not part of her. It has its own bodily systems, its own DNA, fingerprints etc.

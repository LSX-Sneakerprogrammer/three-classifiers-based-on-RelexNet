I don't think that it should be completely pro life, but rather what the circumstances are. For example, if the abortion is because of rape, incest, mother's life is in danger, then I completely understand the reason. However, if abortion is done because protection, either a condom or birth control pills, were not used, then abortion should not be allowed. Be responsible for your own actions.

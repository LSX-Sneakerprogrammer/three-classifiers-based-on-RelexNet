The debate is about abortions, which is about the act of stopping an unwanted pregnancy from developing into a life. Pro-lifers are arguing that abortions are killing lives which is what war is!!!!   So what pro-lifers wanna do is put a ban on wars instead of abortions, since wars are killing actual lives and ruining many others, whereas abortions are just potential lives and not actual lives...  Put a ban on wars and you'll free up so much money spent on defense every year! Why do you worry about abortions so much when the world population is not exactly dwindling...

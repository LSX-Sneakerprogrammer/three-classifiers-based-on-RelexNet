Ok, I see the problem now (and it's not the fact that you're 15 because I don't care about your age or gender), it is: you are unable to form any comprehensible form of logics in any of your arguments. Initially I thought I was debating with someone of fair intelligence with the ability to make clear logical arguments, but that opinion has simply dissipated. It scares me that people like you could be in parliament affecting lots of lives. Here's why:  You say "abortion is a problem, not a solution" - ummm this is YOUR VIEW. My view is that it's NOT a problem but a RESULT of unwanted pregnancies (which is the real problem (and you admit this in the next couple of sentences. Your point is now out the window, so let's see you actually rebut that directly with something else. Alas you probably will, but not with logic.  An episode of Maury Povich? Is that a fictional TV show? You're using that as a basis for your educational system? FYI, the guest speaker tactic has been done to death everywhere. But its impact is still minimal, it's not reaching enough people. Again, my suggestion of putting a hefty fine on unwanted pregnancies would have more impact.  Ok I'm not going to chew your "making a law on abstinence" to pieces, it's essentially dealing with the problem of unwanted pregnancies. We may have some common ground here. I've actually moved past the "banning unprotected sex" arguments to now suggest "making unwanted pregnancies expensive and coupling it with something rehabilitative like a compulsory education on the whole thing."  The problem of rape has already been dealt with. It's called ILLEGAL and includes a jail term. No need to discuss that here.  Banning abortion wouldn't be necessary if you're actually dealing with the problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. So you say that you're not one who push their belief on others and that you're "educative". Then you should stop calling for a ban on abortion. You say you do a lot of research and self-educating on the topic, how come you think banning something will make it go away?   If you continue to argue with a belligerent disregard for logic, I will have no choice but think you an unworthy debater and disengage.

I'm questioning the underlying principle in play here and there is a connection between all the examples I gave. if you can't see the underlying principle here I don't know what to tell you.   The argument looks like this:  X is not worthy of life because of Y, therefore we're justified in killing it.  Now just put Jews, slaves, embryos or what ever in place of "X" and put your reason in place of "Y" and you've got your argument.  Can you see the analogy between them now? So my principal objection is with the "Y" when you have an embryo for "X"

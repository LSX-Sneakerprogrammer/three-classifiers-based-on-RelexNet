The true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion.  The second major issue I have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born...that is scientifically speaking utter garbage...revealing a lack of understanding about human biology.  Abortion is murder.  Pure and simple.  I am no christian incidently...my premise is entirely logical.

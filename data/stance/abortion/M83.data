So I do agree on what you say, "society be responsible for a females irresponsibility".  I wasn't making a statement. I actually disagree.  Educating teens about sex only enhances their sex drive. I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it. At the age of 11 at that. lol. We learn in school that its ok to have sex - as long as you love them. Which is wrong because it will always lead to promiscuity.  People should learn from their mistakes. If I killed someone - should I not be put in jail? As punishment - time for reflection etc? Or should I be allowed to continue because going to jail puts a burden on society, doesn't actually deter me from crime and would surely ruin my life in the long run as getting a job etc. would be much harder?  You're right however. People born in poor conditions (which abortions tend to negate) tend to get caught up in the cycle. Abortion isn't the answer. Less sex - or sex only with the right people is.

Oh please....quit making excuses. People dont talk about it because its an act that kills a living human being. And it does not matter where abortion happens its the same thing. Most women do not come forth with this information because of the nature of abortion. IT KILLS. Women know what it does and they don't want to be judged. That is why so many women suffer in silence over past abortions.   I am not a hypocrite...you just don't get this issue. First of all your a man...and men are really not important in this issue...unfortunately. Most laws say after you ejaculate and implant the sperm your nothing....well unless she desides to have the baby and sues wrongfully for child support. Only then are you an issue. If your wife or girfriend get pregnant by you..........you have no say even if you want your child. And you have no idea what having an abortion is like.....or what a woman might just go through, physically or emotionally.   Your opinion would be like mine if I told a NFL player how it felt to be tackled on the field.   You losing it by calling names? Is that how you interact with people.....calling them names and using profanity. Your entire worldview is pathetic...and shows humanism for what it is....and empty worldview devoid of real happiness.   And I do not believe in human euthanazia or the death penalty.   As I said what you describe does not happen that often in the case of mothers immediately in danger of dying...except a tubal pregnancy. As I said...the life of the mother would come first. The doctor would treat the woman....and still would not have to cut the unborn apart.   If I really care about people, you mean the way you dont? I love people and I help and care for people especially people who are less fortunate than I am. It is sad that all you care about is yourself...that much is obvious. What a sad way to live.

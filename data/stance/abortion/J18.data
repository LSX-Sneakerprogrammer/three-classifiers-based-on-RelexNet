And people who are pro-choice want abortions legal. They want laws in place that give the woman the option of killing. And if we had a nationwide vote…and a pro choicer voted…which would he vote…..Pro-choice abortion or no abortion?   So you think abortion is bad…but yet you want it legal so others can do it. LOL  Abortion is taking a life and that is bad. Abortion procedures are inhumane,,,we don't even do it on animals like we do humans.  Nothing is good about abortion.   Now I know why you won't answer the …do you believe the woman has the right to kill throughout her entire pregnancy? Because if you say yes…then wow…you look terrible even to the pro-choicers who use viability as an excuse,,,and if you say no…then you enslave the woman and your excuse that abortion should be legal because its the woman's body and should be her decision….is shot down. What is it….answer the question. I am debating your position on this and need to know. Are you afraid to answer?  It proves that you were blessed with life…..circular or not. The statement Reagan made is true. We are given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitution….but without life we can't have the others. And we deny that which is in the womb the things you and I take for granted.

Didn't you develop from tissues and cells so what are you referring to? Furthermore if you hurt a person or wound them, does that not involve a damage of the cells, tissues and or organs as well? Isn't that is why they are charged with assault or attempted murder?     You missed the point entirely. Assault isn't a crime because we care about dead cells, it is a crime because we have decided that it is bad behaviour. Same with attempted murder.

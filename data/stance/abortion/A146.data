No, as a Christian, I believe the morality that God gave and still gives applies to everyone of every race, regardless of religion. There is no such thing as another religion, for they are committing idolatry. Either you interpreted my statement wrongly or I misspoke. I don't believe morals are relative to peoples of a certain religion or a certain culture. If I did, I wouldn't be a Christian because I would be contradicting myself and my beliefs.   I think it is important that we go over the verses in question and see the meaning behind it.  Matthew 7:1-5  "Stop judging others and you will not be judged. For others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged. And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? How can you think of saying, 'let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye."  My interpretation of these verses are that Jesus is warning you from judging someone else for their sin when you sin even worse, in other words being hypocritical. Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20). You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching. You see what I am saying? You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur. To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone. We are to judge the  sin  as murder, and always with the goal of helping the  person  see that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin. Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve? It doesn't solve anything. This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7.   On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus. Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved.

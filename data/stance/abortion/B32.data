Murder is a legal definition. It is the unlawful killing of another human being. Thus Abortion is not Murder. Shooting a burglar is "taking someone's life without permission" however that is not murder either.   The right to bodily sovereignty should be absolute. What right is more basic that control over our own body. You have the right not have an operation, or medical care or drugs. You also have the right not to forcible donate blood, or organs, or risk your life to save another.   All pregnancy carries risks to life and health, the fetus uses the mother's blood and organs. She has a right to stop their use. Can she abort in the 9th month? No, but she should have the right to evict. She has control of HER body, not the fetuses.

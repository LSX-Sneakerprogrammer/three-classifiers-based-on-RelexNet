Ok, if outlawing unprotected sex makes it go underground like the drug scene, you don't think the same will happen to abortion if you outlaw that? So many people have brought up the point that outlawing abortion doesn't make it go away, it simply makes the practice unsafe and much riskier.   You're contradicting your own points, so just leave it and relax your views a little bit.   You also agree that we should educate to prevent mistakes from occuring. That's already happening so we're not arguing about that.  You say it's too late to find out about an illegal activity after the consequences? How else can you find out about an illegal activity? Something must happen to bring it to the authorities' attention, duh! How does anyone know if you're wearing your seatbelt when you drive? They don't!!!! But if you have an accident, it becomes apparent, then the law applies! Is it too late? May be it's too late for the driver, but does it serve to educate? YES!!!

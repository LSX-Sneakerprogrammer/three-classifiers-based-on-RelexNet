Thank you for making that point. So infact we don't know what accomplishments these unborn can make but yet we want to abort them? What do you mean there is a much smaller chamce of being born into poverty? Do you read about poverty worldwide? Do you study world history or facts? Read up on thirdworld countries and poverty and pregnancy worldwide.   Also aveske himself told me i have potential to be a great debater so i don't need to explain myself to you. Ask him yourself.

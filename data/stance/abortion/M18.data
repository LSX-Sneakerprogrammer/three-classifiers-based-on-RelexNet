What makes a human a human? What makes you think that your definition is accurate?   A human can think, has some level of autonomy, and generally is able to survive on its own. Human is the biology, the culture, the history, shared by us all.  A foetus in its early weeks cannot think, cannot take care of itself at all, can't make choices. Why would you impose upon women the inability to remove foetuses that aren't individuals?

You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm.   maybe not based on, but exceptions to the norm should at times bear heavily during the legislative process.   The right to life is the most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue.   So the argument is... that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors? If a teen girl was found pregnant she could be arrested for underage sex and could carry to term while incarcerated........ready to be made into a movie...jeez  I think that in a very real sense, the right to "reproductive privacy" precedes the "right to life". I would love to read a response to this particular point.   In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion.   Yes I understand you are a firm proponent of the death penalty....isn't it true?...oh right I remember the logic "You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm"  You don't have to convince me that high abortion rates represent the deepest poverty. I need to be convinced that government intervention (invasion to the privacy thereof) in doctor/pregnant woman relations is merited. Remember I think that the right to life depends on reproductive privacy.

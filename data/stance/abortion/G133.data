"Extra Bunch of Cells?"  Maybe not to the same extent as, say, scraping the inside of your cheek or scratching a layer of epidermis with your fingernails, but they lack any human fetus or vertebrae features until well into 3 months of development. Otherwise, what you'd see under a microscope really would just be unremarkable "cell" reproduction.     I'm sure what Hollow more accurately meant to say was "blastocyst," which is really just a scientific term for the pre-fetus stage of conception in which the developing embryo really IS just a clump of cells that begin reproducing after the fertilized ovum has attached itself to the uteran wall. For the technical definition, see:  Blastocyst: A thin-walled hollow structure in early embryonic development that contains a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass from which the embryo arises. The outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta and other supporting tissues needed for fetal development within the uterus while the inner cell mass cells gives rise to the tissues of the body.  (http://www.medterms.com/script/main/ art.asp?articlekey=18258)   And if you're confused by what an "embryo" is:  A human embryo is a discrete entity that has arisen from either: the first mitotic division when fertilization of a human oocyte by a human sperm is complete or any other process that initiates organized development of a biological entity with a human nuclear genome or altered human nuclear genome that has the potential to develop up to, or beyond, the stage at which the primitive streak appears, and has not yet reached 8 weeks of development since the first mitotic division.

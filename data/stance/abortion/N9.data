1. The comparison is a bad one. Neither moss nor lady bugs have human DNA. A human fetus has a distinct human DNA code from its mother. The complexity of an organism during development does not affect what it is; a child is less complex than an adult, but both are human.  2. From the same place they performed life-or-death abortions before: the hospital or doctor's office. Abortion has always been legal in life-or-death cases.  3. Look over at my post on the other side of the debate and refute those points, please. It's not well-established that it's not murder. Truth is not relative to our current laws.  4. Laws are put in place with punishments attached to keep people from doing those acts. Laws will never stop those who flaunt them, only punish those who are caught. That should not stop laws from being in place.  5. Again refer to my points.

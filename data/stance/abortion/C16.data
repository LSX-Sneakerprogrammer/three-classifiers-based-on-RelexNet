Nothing has a soul. We simply live. A spider has as much life as you and I.   Your subjective belief..not a fact.  Facts are something that are divorced from your general understanding it seems.  A spider may well have a spider soul.  I guess you are one of these people who THINKS they understand science and nature...if you knew anything about the universe you would know to retain an open mind and not make subjective assumptions based on your lack of experience and knowledge.

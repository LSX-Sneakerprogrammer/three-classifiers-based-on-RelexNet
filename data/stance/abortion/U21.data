Personally i think that people should have the ability to make there own choice. If people are against abortion then they should simply not have abortions but i dont feel its right for people to take the choice away from those that do want them.   The reason i believe the choice for abortion should be there is that its better to abort an unwanted child than have it born into poverty and have it suffer immensely with hunger, etc. Also if an unwanted child is born because abortion wasnt an option. That child grows up without love, care, etc and again brings them into a cruel and punishing world with no love or support system also putting them at risk of depression later in life.  It may seem cruel or unfair to abort a child but honestly its far more cruel and unfair to bring a child into a world of poverty, hostility, hatred and other situations and emotions that often surround having an unwanted child.  Starvation was mentioned above,   Whats more cruel aborting a child (no pain or suffering) or having a child that you cant feed that ends up starving to death (which is one of the most excruciating deaths).

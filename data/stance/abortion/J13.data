What is false about anything I have posted concerning abortion?   This issue is a piece of cake. Let science and medicine speak the truth. The truth is…from conception that which is in the womb is alive. Most abortions happen after the heart starts beating.   "In the third month, your baby is the size of a small apple and is fully formed. She has grown from 1 to 3 inches and weighs about 1 ½ ounces by month end. Her head now sits on her neck and you can even see the whorl of a hair pattern on the top of her head. Her head is still very large and makes up half the length of her body. Her eyes are moving closer together and her ears are continuing to form. She has taste buds and has developed the sucking reflex. She is beginning to practice her swallowing too. Teeth buds have also begun to form, as well as fingernails and toenails. Her major organs, as well as her sex organs have formed and are developing steadily. Your placenta has now developed and has taken over hormone production."  Most abortions happen around this gestational age. Wow a lot happening eh? It is not just a glob of tissue.   THIS IS FACT. Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it. However barbaric…abortion should be celebrated and should be allowed…however horrendous it is.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions. You are blind to what the truth says.

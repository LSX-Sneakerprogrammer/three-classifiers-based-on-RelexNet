Pro-life is the way to go, but how are we going to pay for this baby is the main question. Check out my debate on whether or not we should then auction off the parents organs to pay for this unwanted baby if they can't afford they baby. They believe in pro-life, but will let it starve...lol..unless yo'ure going to pay for the baby?

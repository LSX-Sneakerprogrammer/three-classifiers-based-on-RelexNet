//Sex is pleasurable, but it is still procreation.//  Yes, sex is a form of procreation; however, there are points that suggest that sex in humans are not just for procreation. If sex was entirely for procreation, 1) pregnancy would be a direct result every time; 2) we would "know" when a woman is in estrus and engage in sexual activity during this time only; and 3) fertilisation of a human egg is possible without sexual activity due to the invention of IVF.  //If you are smart, you will know that birth control fails. If you are intelligent and want to have sex, but don't want a child, you will re-think the sex.//  Intelligence has nothing to do with having sex or not. It is natural to have sexual desire and in my opinion, it is stupid to avoid sex when it has many other factors than for "making babies". Women are not broodmares.  //What child deserves to die simply because his 'genius' mom doesn't think he should inconvenience her?//  Firstly, what child is involved when a woman is considering abortion during her pregnancy? If you are the "genius" why do you fail to grasp that "child" is the developmental stage from birth to adult?   //Why should he lose his life, which is his own, because he depends on her for survival but she doesn't feel like taking care of him?//  If you want to take this stance then it begs the question: How do you know it has it's own "life" when biologically, it is not viable?  A fetus depends upon the host for development since it cannot function at these life functions without being signalled maternally:  -homeostasis, metabolism, adaptation, organisation, growth, reproduction and respond to external stimuli.

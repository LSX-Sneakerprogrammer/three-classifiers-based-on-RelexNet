That statistic is purely falsified and slanted to fit your point. Yes sex has been on the rise and you blame sex ed? Sex ed was a response to the teen sex rising! You fail to introduce the hundreds of factors that have increase teen sexual behavior.  Allow me to demonstrate a few:  -Increased alcohol abuse   -Christian faith declines, abstinence declines  -Woman gain more rights  -Television idealizes sex  -Society evolves to accept the sex taboo  -Increased drug abuse  -Corporations exploit sexual images  Just to name a few. And you blame SEXUAL EDUCATION?!  The very concept enforced to reduce the outbreak of HIV, teen pregnancy and COUNTLESS STI's and STD's?????  "Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?"  People I know had sex when they were 13, if they had it any later it would have been too late. Guess what? They used a condom! Now I can guarantee you, the neighborhood I grew up in, they would have had sex at such a young age nonetheless of sexual education. But this example proves that sexual education benefited people in the community. This is the entire point of sex-ed, to educate.  "You're wrong. They do it again all the time."  Gratz, you have nothing to prove that statement.   "Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays" "...that's not including rape)."   There have been 13 cases of ten-year-olds and under giving birth. All of them were rape victims....  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_youngest_birth_mothers    "attitude that it's ok to have sex aslong as you 'love' them... In the end the messege leads to - have sex with the person you're with, not the person you 'love'"  Again, I said this before; emotions and sex are purely left for parents. This statement proves no thesis of yours. Sex is not based on emotions on any scale. It is purely hormone based. When you’re in love you still need your hormones for libido. You think animals need love when they have sex? If it is purely natural, you can’t defy the laws of nature.   So tell me, when it is ok to have sex??  "Look what happened when kids were kept in the dark. They didn't have tons of underage sex."  Firstly, my explanation will serve you better knowing how old you are. I can only assume your maybe under 16 because you have a very repressed view on sex.   So if you’re just a teenager (presumptuously), you would feel perfectly comfortable knowing nothing about sex? It would feel right to understand nothing about what is happening to your body? Then you think about a girl in a naughty way then - oops, what was that? You try and hide your dirty thoughts, thinking that your mind is impure. You carry on this way for the rest of your life. These symptoms have a diagnosis. It’s known as sexual repression. Let me tell you, it is far from uncommon and is a horrible affliction to ones life.   Can I tell you about a group of people who suffered from sexual repression? They grew up with celibacy as their answer. They only thought pure thoughts and repressed all urges. As a result, confused as they were, this group sodomized and indecently assaulted 100 thousand + underage children. These were the priests, the bishops and the pastors. This has been going on long before sexual freedom.   “But at least if you're going to teach them about it - teach them that it's wrong to have sex until after you're 16/18/21 or w/e.”  Maybe ‘you’ (the mystical and know-everything teacher) can explain to these kids as to why sex before that age is ‘wrong’ when it clearly is not and especially when it is exercised under the influence of sexual-education and with the help of condoms.   Perhaps you would like to argue why condoms are ‘wrong’ to solidify your statement ;)

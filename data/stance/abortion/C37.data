I think you have missed my basic point.  A human foetus is nothing like a fruit or a banana...so your comparisons are utterly absurd.   Both are unfeeling. Both are unaware of existence. Both are composed of cells. Both have metabolism. Both are offspring of a parent (a fruit is cells around seeds).

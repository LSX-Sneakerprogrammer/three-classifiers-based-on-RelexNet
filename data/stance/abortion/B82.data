So elaborate on that.  Is abortion ok if the child is the wrong sex?  Something wrong with it?  Timing is wrong?  Dont know who father is?  Might be born into poverty?  Mother has to many other kids?  Mother cant afford it?  Mother wants to sell fetal body parts?  Rape?   Incest?  Woman might have stretch marks?  Which one is a good medical reason for abortion? Less than 1% of ALL ABORTIONS ARE DONE ON WOMEN WHO ARE DYING. In most cases the baby can be saved.  Odd...you know its taking the life of a little human being...it gives you the shivers...you dont want to think about it......BUT YOU SAY ITS NOT MORALLY WRONG. LMAO  If its not wrong and the most widely performed surgical procedure in the country...world....then why do you shiver?   Did I miss something?

Oh and one more thing since you are on a debating website then maybe you should read up on the rules of debating especially about the part that said if you don't have facts to support your claims then what it the purpose of that debate. And as i said to my opposing team in the last face to face debate which lasted for 5 hours in two weeks and was based on abortion, "DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK BECAUSE WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE FACTS PORTRAY."

People often try to personalize their pro-life argument by saying "imagine if YOUR mother had aborted YOU! YOU wouldn't be here!" Well, to that I say I wouldn't have cared, I wouldn't have had the capacity to care! But people believe in reincarnation might say that I'd be somebody else! Another person! Probably still to the same mother! Who knows.... But if at the time, she really didn't want to have me, then I say it's her choice.

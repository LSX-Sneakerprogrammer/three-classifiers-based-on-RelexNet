It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working? If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?  It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases. Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion. Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us. And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.

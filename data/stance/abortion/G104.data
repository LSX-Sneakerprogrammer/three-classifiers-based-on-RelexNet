You kept saying that abortion is right?   Sayyad, stop straw-manning me right now. I never once said anything even close to "abortion is right". You keep putting words in my mouth. Do you understand how a debate works?   Why don't you answer me if abortion makes people more responsible?   This isn't even something I've said either. I don't care if abortion makes a person more "responsible" so I never said anything about it. I, unlike you, do not need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it.      You speak as if i am here throwing out stuff just like that. I am surprised that you even want to discuss abortion but yet you don't care.   Again, nothing you've said thus far has anything to do with anything I've said. When did I say I don't care? I'm here aren't I? I didn't care about you're story, but I do care about the issue and your story is irrelevant to it. When did I say you were "throwing out stuff just like that"? Wtf does something like that even mean?  Either you have the wrong address, or you're the single worst debater I've spoken to thus far.   How can a person argue about a topic and say they don't want to know about the rest?   How abortion started doesn't matter. Why would it? It has nothing to do with the issue now.    If i am silly about my preferences then how come you don't know anything about abortion?   Does this pass for logic these days???  If I don't know anything about abortion then how come you added the number "99" to your user name? =/  (note: I'm saying your question doesn't make sense)   Who looks more silly? Me or you?    You or I&lt;&lt;   You don't tell me my preference is silly when you can't even give a justification for your choice   Do you not even see your own conceitedness?  You're saying "I've decided abortion is immoral and I've also decided that everyone should conform to my morality because my morality cannot be wrong, I came up with it!"  Well, how great full these women must be to have someone like you do decide that abortion is wrong for them. =/  And you say this is  not  silliness?   Maybe you should come when we are debating and you will have to see how debating goes and why we law students choose our topics.   Oh dear god. YOU got into law school? Hopefully not to be a lawyer, you'd end up sending all your own clients to the chair.  You think I care that you're a law student? Do you think that makes you infallible? You sir, are beyond egotistical.   Your opinions are based on arrogance or ignorance without any proof or evidence.   Now you're just projecting. ;)   Why don't you try becoming a District Attorney and if you can become one then judge them.    You're not even trying to make sense now, are you? Are you a troll? You must be, no one else could string together so many irrelevant "arguments" and walk away feeling like they've accomplished something.   i don't have time to waste on any argument filled with arrogance.   Ah, that explains why you didn't bother proof reading your argument. =/   When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.   Alright, so a reference is pointless because where life begins is a philosophical question, it isn't proven based on how many more people agree with you.  Life is a continuum. It doesn't "stop" or "start", it just changes.   Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?   jeez, I don't know what I'm more disappointed in; your poor grammar or the fact that I understood that perfectly =/  A person's profession has nothing to do with their ability to control themselves. Unless she's being raped for money, then shes exercising self control by being a prostitute.   What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?   I don't care. Women could get abortions as a hobby for all I care, I don't need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it, I'm not as egotistical as you.   How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?   Again, I don't care and it doesn't matter. It's their choice. They're making the risk, not you, not I. It's none of out business.    Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?   When did I say this? I didn't, because it's not my position.   Try again.   If you say you don't care or you avoid these questions then you are clearly showing that your level of knowledge in this area is based on merely your opinions and not facts.   Or it means you're an idiot and you can't tell the difference between relevant facts and appeals to emotion/authority.  Anyone can pull up an infinite amount of facts, it mean nothing if they aren't relevant. Though, it's cute how you thought writing this would somehow convince me to answer all your questions as though they  were  relevant. XD   If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified.   You keep saying "law student" like being a law student matters. it doesn't. And I don't care if someone would "disqualify" you for what I've done because  1. It's irrelevant to this debate   and 2. I happen to know for a fact that calling "non-sequiter" on an opponent during a debate is not only allowed, but frequently taken advantage of.  So, either you are a liar or your debating league is full of idiots.  Judging by your argument thus far the former seems much more likely.    Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.   Why did you write this? It has nothing to do with anything EITHER of us has written.   "Well, we decided that Hitler was innocent last night, therefore abortion is WRONG!" &lt;&lt; does this make sense to you??? Or are you purposefully using non-sequiters in an attempt to distract me from your paper-thin argument? =/

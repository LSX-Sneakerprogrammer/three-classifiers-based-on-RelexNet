well if it's abstinance your talking about, then your probably a christian. and in the bible it says that refraining from all sexual activity is pure abstinance. that includes handjobs, blowjobs, anything that looks sexual (which includes making out). I dont know of even one person who abides by those shitty rules. not even "Devoted" christians

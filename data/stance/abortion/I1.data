To be honest, yes it is in some way "murder," but what is the other solution? The mother wants to abort because of some specific reason, let it be because the unborn child is deformed, it was a rape child, or it was just an unwanted child(by mistake when drunk and such)... Tell me honestly if you got an wanted child you would keep it because you think it is "murder". most people abort because they don't have the money to support that unborn child. What is better? Letting the child into a world of sh*t or spare it of what could have come. Why would you take the risk? Because if you do take the risk then and it turns out bad then it wouldn't only hurt the child's life, but yours too, and you families lives/economy. And in the long Run it will cost the country they live in a lot of money because if they can't provide someone has to get them money... Who'll do that? Most likely that state and their family members...

The big picture being that this entire issue is not black and white.   But isn't it? You either are for woman being able to choose to abort a fetus, or you're against it.  Being for abortion in the case of rape or incest is completely inconsistent. Why would a pro-lifer be for  killing  an innocent baby in an incident of rape, whereas if the woman conceived a baby with her consent, she is absolutely forbidden to abort the baby because it's murder.  Why the double standard and inconsistency?

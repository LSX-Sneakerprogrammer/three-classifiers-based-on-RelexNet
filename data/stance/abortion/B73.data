Well Hollywood goes to doors for animals.....animals are put on the endangered list, and many people put animals above humans. We are however are not animals...and abortion is barbaric.   If you believe that a woman has the right to choose......then you must allow her that choice throughout the entire pregnancy, or you enslave her because YOU DONT THINK its right at that point. At what point does she loose control of the right to decide?   If you condone abortion....you are pro-choice, not pro-life. If there were a nationwide poll and we were allowed to vote.....1/ woman can choose 2/abortion illegal with stipulations....she was dying............which one would you choose? If you choose 1, then your vote is on the abortion side. How many lives did your vote save? NONE.

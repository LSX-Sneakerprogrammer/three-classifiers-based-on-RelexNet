Such a small and lacking response makes me regret complimenting your previous one.   "So if one of your children got a disease...or became handicapped.....would you hire the killing done or would you do it yourself?"  If it was detected during pregnancy yes I would definitely want an abortion but once it has been born it has entered the realm of society where my line is drawn. You make me out to be some serial killer yet you don't expound on how the reason behind it is flawed, you only call me evil and insult my beliefs and party.   "You said society would be better without people such as this...I assume you meant your family as well. Right?"   Yes if a defect is detected during pregnancy. Now I am not saying they have to, I am saying that if it was up to me I would choose an abortion, and if you believe that is wrong due to your close minded perception of morality, then that is of no consequence to me. You are trying to run a perceptive analytical argument and it is frustrating me because my source of these views is based on that of a separate pattern of thinking, I am coming from a place of thought and logic, you are coming form a place born from what you perceive to be "right" or "moral" when in fact you have little to no understanding of the impacts such thinking has had on society and yet you call me a danger. If you think my views on abortion are somewhat cruel, Im sure my views on religion would surprise you even more.

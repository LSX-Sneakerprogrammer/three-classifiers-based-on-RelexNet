Hey, sperm does not equal fetus. What iamdavidh is trying to say is that sperm equals same category as fetus! SAME CATEGORY!!!!! POTENTIAL LIFE! get it? I'll say it again: IT'S NOT A PERSON LIKE YOU AND I WHO CAN ASK "WHY" OR "HOW". The fetus is a "thing". It's parasitic in relationship with its host. It can feel pain? My arm can feel pain! My arm has all the human DNA to make another human being, so do sperms and eggs. The fetus can certainly become a person but before it does, it's NOT. NOT A PERSON! P.O.T.E.N.T.I.A.L. ONLY!

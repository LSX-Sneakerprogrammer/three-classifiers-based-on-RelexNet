only 19% of polled people believe "abortion is wrong no matter what"  I'm assuming at least 4% of those don't understand specific diseases that account for around 1-3% of abortions performed because the fetus is grotesquely misformed and birthing it will result in the fetus' death within minutes and potentially the mother's death if not aborted.  So yeah, 15%.  The problem is for you, most don't know about abortion, what it actually entails, why it is actually performed, in what numbers, and what women did before it was available.  Once they know these numbers; that before it was legal there were just as many abortions but instead they were performed in alleys and basements, that the vast majority that have abortions do it in the first 2-4 weeks, that the vast majority also were either raped or are having an aborition due to some medical issue, or that the women you and your ilk constantly demonize, the ones who casually decide on this course of action make up such a low percent you might as well outlaw instances of albino,  then even those answering "oh yeah whatever, I'm pro-life" would actually change to pro-choice.  So yeah, 15% and once again it's religion using a wedge issue to garner more power from idiots like youself.  Hey, more people died of starvation last year than abortion, when are you going to start sending money to Africa you asshole?

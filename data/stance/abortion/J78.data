It is not accurate. They don't use, the only word I can think to describe them, tongs. They use a vacuum now.   And I actually don't have a problem with any abortions. I just don't like that they use something that's illegal, and it is almost everywhere, though like everything illegal it's doesn't mean it doesn't happen, to convince people to change their minds.   I don't honestly care if it's alive or not, it's a burden, usually a complete accident and we're over-populated as it is. So abortion is a good choice in my opinion.

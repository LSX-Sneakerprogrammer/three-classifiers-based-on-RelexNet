"People like me" huh? Wow you sure do know a lot about me and my ilk for a 17 year old kid.  At any rate, your link only further's my point since it is not even until week 6 that any sort of brain wave is detected and the vast vast majority of abortions happen in the first two weeks.   And  your link says nothing of being self-aware or feeling pain... which is my argument.  What you have done is  changed  my argument to one you feel you can argue against. However, whether a fetus were inside a human, or laid in a nest, the fact would remain it has no capacity for any of the thought or emotion which makes it human, and therefore I would still not be against abortion.  And I'm refusing your enemy request. You pro-force-women-rape-victims-and-teenag e-girls  to have kids they don't want get all emotional on this subject. You likely aren't thinking straight right now.

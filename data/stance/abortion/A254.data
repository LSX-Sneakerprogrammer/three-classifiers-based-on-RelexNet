I couldn't help but notice what a load of bulls  t you're capable of dishing out.  Firstly you're way off the topic of the debate. It's whether abortion should be banned! Not whether human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial. If people want to get rid of their fetuses it's their choice (whether it's sacrificial or not).   I suggest you save some of that energy to debating the topic. So far, all i've heard in the hundreds of arguments against abortion is that "it's a person, don't commit murder"... which has been rebutted many times. So bring something original to the debate, don't dress up the same cr*p in different packaging.

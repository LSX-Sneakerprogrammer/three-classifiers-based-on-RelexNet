You do not have to be more easy going on the restrictions you chose to place on your own life, but you must realize that people place different values on different things depending on what is important to them. To me, 'seeing with my heart' is a nonsensical concept that entails someone blindly believing something they have been told without trying to verify if it is true. However, I realize you place more value on faith than logic, and I do not think that logic is inherently better than faith so I would never try to force you to accept logic over faith. I think you should afford people the same courtesy, realize God and the Bible are not important to everyone, and not try to extend your judgments and morals to include them.

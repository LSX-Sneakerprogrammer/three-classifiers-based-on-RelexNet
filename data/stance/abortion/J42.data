If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault!   What? Of course it is their fault. They CHOSE to have sex. They KNEW no protection or form of contraception is 10% effective. If it fails, don't blame the contraceptive. They knew there was a chance that it could fail. Yet, knowing this AND knowing the fact that they would not be prepared should it not work, they still had sex. They put pleasure before the consequences and that is their failing.    That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were "irresponsible".   That is an awful analogy. A better analogy would be if the Haitians had placed thousands of tons of high explosives on the fault line and blew them up and were surprised there was an earthquake.   I haven't seen you challenge the definitions I have quoted, so I'll assume you don't have a problem with them.   The definition you gave was not a scientific definition. Yes, there are scientific definitions, but that is irrelevant because you chose to ignore them in favor of an inappropriate one.    Wasn't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged?   Nope. That is a lie. I said serious defect. By that I mean anything that would in all likelihood result in the child's death. It is perfectly normal for a child's brain to develop. That is not a defect, that is immaturity.

So the woman takes the chance, it is her decision, HER RESPONSIBILTY   You really are a sexist pig. The male who has sex with her and impregnates takes half the responsibility for pregnancy. It's not solely a woman.   Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion   Because if a child is going to make her life more awful than what she's already experienced she has the choice to not go through that. I'm not saying you  should  abort in these circumstances but I understand entirely why people do.   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die?    You are possibly the biggest word mincer ever. I personally wouldn't abort a child on these grounds and I'm not saying people  should . But yet again I understand and sympathize with someone who does.   .Hitler had the same idea did you know that?   Stop calling and comparing me to Hitler. It's so rude.   You are making excuses for the killing.   I'm not making excuses. I'm saying I understand why woman would abort in these situations. Stop acting like I advocate death and I'm murdering people.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks   I think that's probably a very selfish reason however I don't know the woman's background maybe she has serious depression and her self esteem is low. Hence I said "life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)" Oh and in response to your question about I meant, I mean personally if someone were to abort because it was the wrong sex or something along those lines I'd probably think it was a bit selfish. But I wouldn't out right deny the woman the right to do so. And don't call me a hypocrite, because I still believe the woman has the right to abort under those circumstances.   What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time   This is coming from the person who believes a woman has no right to abort at all? A woman can abort for whatever reason she likes it has nothing to with me I've never led you to believe that I think only some woman can abort. And just to clarify I've already posted the scientific studies and facts on when a baby feels pain and it's brain is active, and why that is my defining limit on abortion gestation with some exception. If you couldn't be bothered to read it that's your problem.

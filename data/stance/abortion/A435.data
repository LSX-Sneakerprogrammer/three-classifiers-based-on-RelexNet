No, of course abortions should not be banned for you would have them anyway regardless of safety, funding or anything else that might get in the way. We would be back in the days of the butcher shops and that wouldn't be good for anyone. Abortion is not a trivial matter and is one that must be thought out thoroughly by the person or persons involved. I wouldn't like to see us take such a serious step lightly nor would I like to see us take a step backwards in time.

What the hell are you even doing on a site titled "create debate" then?   Correcting criminals like yourself that think a debate justifies your criminal intention!  Silly criminal, debates are for just persons with just intentions, not criminals with crime in the seared conscience!  STFU? Create Debate is not a forum for justifying the unjustifiable. Create Debate is a debating format for rational thought. Killing an un-born fetus cannot be rationalized! So, why do you stretch the intention of debate? I know! You are justifying your intent!  Justifying the undebatable with debate!   You are still a criminal!

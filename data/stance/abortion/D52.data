This is another example, along with gay marriage, where I feel the government should have no say. It's a person's body, their life, it should be their decision. Abortion isn't pretty or good, but life isn't always either, and maybe some of these woman realize they can't and will never be able to provide their child with a good life. Still, I believe abortion is the biggest moral issue in our society right now and one that will be intensely debated for a long time.

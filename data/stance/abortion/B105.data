She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either   Why don't you respond to my posts? I've said this before but woman do take measures to not get pregnant by using contraception. Contraception  fails . I got pregnant on the contraceptive pill which I took correctly, it happens (I didn't abort by the way, but it's just an example). Or do you consider contraception killing of a potential child too?   The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame..   Wow , you're one hell of a sexist! Why does a woman have to take sole responsibility of a pregnancy? How dare you say no one else to blame! The man is just as responsible for the action of sex and creating a life yet he wouldn't get your giant speech on the immorality or creating unwanted life. Not once in the whole discussion have you ever mentioned the males role in creating a baby just how terrible the woman is.   Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube. Other than the egg and the sperm...she did not use any organs of her mothers body   She was  conceived  in a test tube. She didn't spend 9 months on a petri dish growing. Her embryo was placed into a womb and relied on a woman's organs to live. Your statement is all wrong.   If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not   The man is not the issue? Do you realize how many woman get abortions because the person who impregnated them pressured them into doing so? The men often  want  the woman they got pregnant to abort. He is just as responsible for creating the life as she is and if  wants  her to abort then he is just as responsible for the termination.

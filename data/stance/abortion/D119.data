Look at it this way: should a human life suffer because of the mistakes of their parents? I mean, you're saying a human shouldn't suffer death because the parents conceived the child against their wills. My issue is, a) a fetus isn't a human and I have a hard time with people comparing fetus's to a newborn with a brain. b) The consequences of those parens having a child when they can't even afford to take care of it, not just financially, but probably mentally and emotionally, only leads for that child, with feelings, and a current life, to suffer. I think they're two totally different things: fetus vs child. I understand the empathatic thoughts of abortion, but I believe it hurts a hell of a lot more seeing kids abused and abandoned than it does to see a fetus aborted.

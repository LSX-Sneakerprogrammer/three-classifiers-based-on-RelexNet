Unlike you I don't JUST want to have the last say:  Agreeing to disagree means abortions should not be banned. I'll explain what this means to you since you clearly have no idea. So the 2 sides disagree on whether abortions should be banned, which means each to its own: This essentially means pro-lifers can go on having children (regardless of whether they want them or not). Pro-choicers can go on having abortions as an option. Each to its own! To make a law in any democratic society, the majority must agree, if you don't have a majority, then the law will not pass, so the status quo is abortions CANNOT BE MADE ILLEGAL.. get it?  Government's choice, you say? The government represent the people of a nation if you live in a democratic society. Where do you live?

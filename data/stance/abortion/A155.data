To sum up your argument:  Pro-lifers are hypocrites because they oppose the killing of babies from abortions while approving of the killing of babies during war.  I understand your viewpoint, but I disagree with it. I don't approve of war at all, and I am pro-life for the most part. There are other people just like me as well, but you said many, so you are pretty much correct in your reasoning.

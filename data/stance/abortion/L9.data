I'd also like to add..................  If as you declare your question to be specific to medical conditions, may I NSH suggest that you leave the matter to the physicians and the mother. I find it downright presumptuous of you and others to get involved. Surely your life consists of matters over which you legitimately do have control. This is NOT one of them.

First of all it is sad that you would call talking about the life of a human being bullshit. Shows you are losing control...or did not have it from the beginning. One can disagree with something and not use profanity.   I have shown by posting here what SCIENCE SAYS ABOUT LIFE AND WHEN IT STARTS. This has nothing to do with religion. As I have said...one need not even bring God into the equation to see that abortion is wrong.   Now what I find amusing is this....You say the woman has the right that its her body and she should be able to do with it what she wants. Then you turn around in some self-righteous way...and take this away from the woman in the third trimester. LMAO  Is there something wrong with abortion iamdavidh? You must think so or your views wouldnt be like this. Do you know anything about fetal development? You want to enslave a woman to pregnancy....you want to take her right to her body away. Shame on you.   For your information....no child at birth could survive without intervention. And even children born at full term might need medical assistance. What difference does it make whether that medical assistance takes place at 22 weeks....38 weeks or when its born?  If anyone is contradictory, inhumane, compassionless, cold, empty...as far as their worldview is....its you not me. I simply want to protect human life, the human life that is defenseless against people like you who pain a bullseye on their forhead and want them dead.   You are a blamer......you whine and you put the blame places to make yourself feel good about your lack of doing anything for anyone. Why should it be my responsibility to solve the worlds problems? What about personal responsiblity? You're a Democrat aren't you? You are the psychotic one, not me. I work at crisis pregnancy centers and I work at Right to Life and with a group, Silent No More. I do my share. What do you do for mankind besides complain?   I am crusading for life and for personal responsiblity. And if you knew anything about abortion, you would see that your last comment is absurd. Why don't you go to the Guttmaucher site on abortion and educate yourself, so you don't look so silly.

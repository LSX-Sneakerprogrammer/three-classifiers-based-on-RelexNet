So either  1) you do indeed think it is an accident  OR  2) Your analogy fails as it is being compared to a straw man.   You are attacking a straw man here again. I said that the failure of contraception was an accident, not pregnancy.   They knew it is possible and they are at fault for ignoring all the possibilities.   By that same standard, you are also pushing the blame of the damage caused by the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake completely on the Japanese. If you have the audacity to claim that, I would say that you have less knowledge of Geography that my 5 year old nephew.   How does human not equal homo sapien?   I don't believe that was what I said. Homo sapien is a species of animals. To be human, one must also possess personhood. According to Dr. Mianna Lotz from the Centre of Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne, whom I've had the pleasure to meet recently, "Personhood is generally defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self."   I am only in favor of abortion in cases where it would be fatal.   Conversely, even when the effect of an action is fatal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the action itself was wrong.   I have indeed. They new the consequences. They ignored them.   That is an extremely feeble argument. How can someone ignore unforeseen circumstances?

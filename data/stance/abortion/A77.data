Great! another bible basher!  Quoting chunks from the bible isn't going to win you any debates. Wars have been waged on bible material for too long! It's time people stop bashing bibles!  Now the difference between a fetus and a person has been over-explained here but you pro-lifers hold on to your belief that it's the two are the same. It's fine if you believe that, but don't go around forcing that belief on others. I'm sure the bible has a passage somewhere about how you should respect your neighbours.  Women suffer as a result of abortions? Don't generalize because I personally know women who don't.

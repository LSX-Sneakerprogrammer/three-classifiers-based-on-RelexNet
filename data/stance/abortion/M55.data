Wasting the condom therefore would be the same as wasting a child's life, using your reasoning.  That is NOT my reasoning. I have some tests coming up so i won't respond immediately perhaps this weekend I'll write something up summarizing my position. Responding and not stating may of lead to confusion. My responses have been criticisms of the argument from sapience you have been making, not a argument for or against abortion themselves. Instead of being reactive I'll be active, so far this debate has been very helpful. i think i can now put explicitly my objections but i won't have time to make sure their elegant, concise etc till the weekend. I likely won't get on this website till then, or Friday.

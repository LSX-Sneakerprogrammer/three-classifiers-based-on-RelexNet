Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married   Even if they are married it's the woman's decision still so this has no validity.   Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him   No, no, no. If he is considered on ALL grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead.   And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig…to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective?   You also called me a sissy? Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. It's not an adjective. Brush up on your English language. It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp.   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   I'm a fully fledged adult. It is not the truth it's your opinion. And I'm arrogant yet your  feelings  have to be the truth?   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates…when I have not.   Yay another list for me to make. Things you have said religiously to back your opinion:  He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs,  But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion…  But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God…and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws.  But I love Christ more than any other person in the world….and I have faith in Him….more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect….and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved  I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this.   You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts…and makes you look like you have no class.    No, a swear word is a word. It means nothing. Oh look another insult to me. Why thank you very much. And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos!   Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter…..but will leave it with these two   I think a few re reads are in order here. Read their opinion and read mine. It's not even comparible.   Why don’t you do some heavy research on this…not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts.   My education is nursing. I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. My opinion is what  you  think is heartless and cold. To many others it is acceptable and logic. Don't speak for the world  .    Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.   I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that. I don't champion killing, I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself. I just understand why people do.   Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I’m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat…unless he is married and the courts order him to pay   Biology isn't sexist again I study it. The context in which you describe things is sexist. The truth is what you perceive it to be. The truth is never what  you  think. Yes he does. If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support.   They both have sex….blah blah……..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?   My fiance and I weren't married. He took responsibility. He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception. Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion.   Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don’t want to see the evidence.    No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. I use my evidence you use yours. Why does it matter?   Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.   Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated? No, I have educated myself and come to a conclusion. You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. That's the difference between you and I, I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. You're a forcer, you think that everyone  has  to share your opinion or they're a bad person. And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England.   Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least.   So because I believe woman have the right to abortion I no longer have feelings. I feel empathy and sympathy, it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences. Stop word twisting.   My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way   It's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim I want abortion to be seen positively. Consistence in the key in debating. Something you clearly don't have.   Tell me……Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn’t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can’t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed….and I am allowed to change my mind…..are you?   Yes and yes. I never denied this fact so I guess I'll just answer the first two questions. You can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and I never claimed it to be. I'm allowed to change my mind, I probably won't on this topic though.   What you’re saying here….is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don’t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant….. but then you’re perfect remember?   No I'm not. I'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself. Again I'm aware of the consequences of abortion. Are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted? Explain to me exactly when I have judged someone and acted arrogantly? Thanks for calling me perfect all the time. I don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason.   When you make a huge mistake….if you have children don’t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them?   I protect my child and I will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. But I'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset. I won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up. A lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize. If my daughter was ever pregnant I'd help her. If she asks for the pros and cons I will tell her. If she asks me what to do I will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. Why? Because her happiness is the most important thing to me.   Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing….and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated……good should have overcome evil, but didn’t.   People stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared. And people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice. They didn't  let  Jews get gassed. Everyone participated? That's a wild claim to make. Most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that.   Oh my goodness don’t. I was not a child when I had it….   Did I say you were?   I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok.   And I'm arrogant. Stop calling me perfect, I'm blushing.   I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN….and have a blessed life.   Great. I have a wonderful child to. This means nothing to the debate subject. And being with same man isn't an accomplishment. It's a choice.    I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard.   You aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't? Or that they're like Hitler? That they are murderers? Come off your high horse..   Distraught about what?   Having an abortion, derp.   how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip….then go against what your morals tell you is wrong?   It is a horrible experience. My morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances.    Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Abortion is horrible, I've seen many. (The nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). It's not cold, uncompassionate and empty. You yourself said it's emotionless. How can it be empty then? I'm a bad person even though I assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth? Do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save? And because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers?    What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young?    Of course abortion is upsetting for a child. The word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age? I thought that was common knowledge.   I told my kids when they were teenagers. It’s not selfish…its real life and it happens.   So they weren't children....   Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me?    Abortion of a sibling effects someone personally. Watching south park doesn't.   LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with   Well I listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance. Of course I have problem with racism.   You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you’re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch…shows. That’s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life   No you  think  I am pro abortion. I know I'm not. I am neutral if anything. I don't deceive myself into anything, you want to believe I am so you can preach. Even if I was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right. I stand up for life especially those already born. I stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start.   . I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I    No you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours. Because you don't like my opinion you assume I am an awful person.    You condone murder….I never called you a racist   You said I had the same opinion as Hitler and Margaret who are racist. So yes you did.   I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And….you are judging me…   No you're not. You are trying to warp my opinion and claim I am a bad person because of it. Your opinion is not  right  to everyone. Just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth. You just offend people by dismissing anything they say. You haven't exposed me. My opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it. I never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion.   I point out what you say that are untruths    They're not untruths, you believe they are. Just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong.   Why do you quote a book you don’t believe in?   Not once have I quoted the Bible. Perhaps say when? Didn't think you could...   You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period….live with it accept the label take it as your own.   Again your opinion is not fact. You  think  I am pro-abort it doesn't make it true.    I am not however handing my posts in to be graded….so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work….I live a full life and when I get on here….I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper ….it would be correct.   Great, I study work and have a 8 month old. I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly.   You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie….I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know…   I haven't lied once. You constantly lie, I pointed out every lie. All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate. I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. I work in this field idiot. Nurse/midwife mean anything to you?   This is your worldview…and explains what I said all along…why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.   It doesn't explain anything. I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. I certainly would never love you. Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right. Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life.   Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   Huge difference. I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. You tell me I am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. You place no actual evidence just your opinion. Your opinion is NOT fact.   You said two things in your post…………you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks….and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Ever heard of reading? It will do your argument good. They feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and I think abortion should happen before that. Honestly, you liar, I said what about 30 times? 24 week abortions are wrong.   So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain….or 24 weeks when obviously it can’t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.  Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw…you don’t.   Yes it is 12-14 weeks. Like I said all along. What the hell are you talking about? I said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks. I know my position. I swear because I want to. I like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word. Yes I know when. The fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester, again I've said that all along.

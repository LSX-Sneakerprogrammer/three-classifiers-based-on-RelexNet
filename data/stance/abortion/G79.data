Really? Give me one reason why? So are you implying that when you were in the womb of your mother you were unworthy of human rights? We are talking about the "life of a developing human being for your information".   Life is not "a life" intrinsically because it has no proper brain. A mass of cells knows nothing.  Now that I was born, I earned human rights.  Why give an unintelligent mass of tissues or cells human rights?   Why don't you save me some time and read up on that historic case i made reference to?   I don't care about it. The court has little relevance to reality. If it was a scientific journal, I would care.   For your information again we are talking about the cells of the sperm and zygote which when fuse brings about the reproduction of a developing human being. Furthermore scientifically the fetus is referred to as a human organism. Define the term organism for me?   It doesn't matter if the tissue is human. When you donate a kidney, is that kidney "a life" or just "life" Hmm? A foetus isn't self-aware.  Organism is the most inclusive term for life.   That statement you made is full of arrogance and wrongful judgment. Many of my friends who were born out of poverty or unpreparedness are now successful lawyers, doctors, singers etc? Would you say that they should have been killed as a child too. That does not make any sense at all.   What I said was a rational statement. I still support it no matter how you try to appeal to my emotions.  The simple fact is that abortion culls unwanted offspring from the population. A child should be wanted, and prepared for.  Go ahead. Try to make an argument that an unwanted child or a child raised as a burden are both GOOD things for society.

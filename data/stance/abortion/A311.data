Ok, now you're being dramatic and it's not funny at all. If you're not a woman experiencing PMS then you really have no excuse, but if you are then calm down and see my point. It's really quite workable:  Ok, what I mean is make "sex that results in an unwanted pregnancy" illegal. Ok, unwanted pregnancy is the key. Having sex risks pregnancy, everyone knows that, just like driving without wearing your seatbelt risks serious injury. You can risk it if you want, but when the unexpected result happens, you have a choice: You can decide if you WANT the pregnancy OR NOT. If you decide that you don't WANT the pregnancy, then the law kicks in!!!! A hefty fine is a very good deterent. You can build the cost of the fine into the cost of an abortion. This would make the cost of an abortion very very expensive. The proceeds from this could all go into funding educational programs about sex and pregnancy, counselling, etc... You can even build in a jail term for the guilty if you feel that monetary fines aren't enough.  So, as with seatbelt wearing in a car, over a short period, people would all learn to do it responsibly and it will become second nature and not have to be such an issue. Don't make it illegal, regulate it and everyone's a winner.

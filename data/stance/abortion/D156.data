Personally, I don't think abortion should be allowed anywhere. Abortion is a cruel way to get rid of a child. The mother always has choices readily available to them, and many hospitals have programs that give unwanted babies to good homes. I think that for those who consider an abortion, they shouldn't have opened their legs in the first place, whether the guy was wearing a glove or not. Unless there was a life-or-death situation where the mother could die with a c-section or die having a baby. then it's appropriate.

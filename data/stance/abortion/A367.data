If abortions haven't got a feasible reason to exist then why do they happen? Do you think it's a fun past-time for the people who have to go through it? Oh, we're bored so let's go and get an abortion for shits and giggles? Abortions DO have really good reasons to exist, that is why they continue to exist, you just haven't opened your mind to our side of the issue. But that's ok, cos we're not interested in forcing you to do what we do, stop trying to force us.  About killing a fetus, I know this may sound a little heartless to you but I'd still like to see you argue this properly: Why shouldn't we kill fetuses? We can make fetuses all the time (some people can't but this doesn't concern them), the human population in the world continue to grow and if overpopulated, we'd be in crisis mode because of food shortages and environmental destruction. We don't owe fetuses anything! If we want to have kids and give them a chance to contribute to society as well as carry on our genetic heritage then we can keep the fetuses, but if we don't want kids, we can just get rid of the fetuses, we don't need to consider if the fetuses have committed a crime or not, we don't need any excuse at all. Hell, they can't commit crimes.

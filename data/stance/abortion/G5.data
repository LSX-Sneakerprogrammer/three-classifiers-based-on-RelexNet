I think so too. Every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. I am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the U.S Supreme Court in which all of the judges were men.

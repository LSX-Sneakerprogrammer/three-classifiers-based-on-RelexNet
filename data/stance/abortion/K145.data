Dear opponent, let me ask YOU a question.. do you even know how to debate?!  In a PROFESSIONAL debate, you do not attack any opponent but attack the argument.. I suggest you concentrate on attacking the argument instead of attacking the opponent next time..    Don't change the topic.   First of all, i do not follow any religious groups and personally i think that that information about condoms is just ridiculous and built on ignorant opinions..   You identify as Muslim, which is a religious group, and Muslim religious authorities have spread misinformation about scientific issues. The Catholics however are the primary offenders when it comes to issues of birth control misinformation.   Secondly, if i were to follow your "style" of debating, I'd say: You are acting irrationally and a person with no beliefs or morals.   Whether or not I have morals or beliefs is not the topic of this debate. You should be more concerned with my statement about imposing your morals and beliefs upon others.   Third of all, exactly as you said, these are my beliefs and morals and as i said only God decides the fate of all mankind, so i am simply sharing my point of view and debating. I am not forcing anything on anyone and every person is free to follow what they believe...   It is often best to not base a position on beliefs but instead form a position from data and evidence, that way you can form an unbiased solution for dealing with the problem at hand. If you take a random handful of people, and ask them how they feel about abortion, they'll give you widely varying starting times for when it is killing an innocent life, ranging from conception to birth. However there is only one true answer, and this is why science is important here.   Yes i am. In the case where a woman practices unsafe sex and does not want a pregnancy to occur, there are certain pharmaceutical drugs that should be taken between 48 - 72 hours after intercourse.. Otherwise, expect anything..   Fertilisation begins 3 weeks after intercourse. About 50% of abortions occur before the zygote becomes an actual foetus, and about 40% occur before the foetus has a developed heart.   Is she really? As i mentioned in an earlier argument, by keeping quiet she is the one allowing herself to go through all this pain.. She may be scared but if she thought of the consequences of keeping quiet - which is a pregnancy maybe - then she should realize keeping quiet isn't the wisest thing to do.. You speak up, you get help and there would be no reason for abortion anyway...   Yes. Getting an abortion is a form of personal responsibility.  Do you have trouble understanding rape? If a woman is raped, the social stigma of being pregnant is less important than the persistent reminder that your child is unwanted, forced upon you by a violent sexual act, and the offspring of the man who did this to you.  This is why using god as a basis of ethics and morality can lead to some very unrealistic solutions to simple problems.

I believe that abortion is something we should embrace as an option but not as the only solution. I saw an awful interview with a woman who "survived abortion" during the seventh month of her mothers pregnancy. She of course is now a pro lifer and spews misinformation about Obama being a baby killer. Nowadays abortions are not typically done at that point of a pregnancy. If a baby cannot survive outside the womb, or outside of an artificial womb known as an incubator, there is nothing morally or ethically wrong about aborting that said baby. A child changes the lives of many people involved. If that child cannot be brought into a life of happiness and a healthy, stable environment- they really don't need to be brought into the world at all. We're there medically. If, according to an above poster, it is the woman's fault, then it of course is also the woman's choice. There's no point in fighting for something that isn't a living breathing thing- embryos do NOT count

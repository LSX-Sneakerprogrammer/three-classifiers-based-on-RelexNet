Until the fetus can actually survive outside the womb, it's a potential. Fertilization doesn't all of a sudden make an egg or a sperm instantaneous life. A lot of things must be perfect for the embryo to make it all the way to the end. If people drink too much alcohol it might kill the embryo, there's a host of other things that can affect its survival, shall we outlaw them all?  I fully support giving people choice when it comes to other options. What I don't support is making it compulsory. Plain and simple.

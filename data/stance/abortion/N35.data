I'm sorry you regret your decision.  But I honestly believe that it is more selfish to trick yourself into thinking that you can care for a child, when you can't, and end up not giving the child the best life possible. THAT seems more selfish to me than letting go.   Also, adoption is not a choice some people can make, for personal reasons they don't want to do it, but yes, it is an other option, just not one for everyone.

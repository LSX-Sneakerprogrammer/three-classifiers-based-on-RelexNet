Abosolutely no, abortion is also killing and i don't think it should be made legal.  Even though it is used for some reason, a life is at stake.  When abortion occurs for no reason, it is considered as murder.  But if the foetus or baby implicate the mother's life, it''s up to the mother and father decision.

I agree with Kmac. If you think you are old enough to have sex then you better be old enough and ready to deal with the possible consequences of having sex. There is always that possibility of becoming pregnant, so if you have sex and get pregnant deal with it!! Abortion is just wrong. Why kill someone that has done nothing wrong? The baby should not have to pay for your mistakes. If you can't handle having a child then let someone adopt it, don't kill it!

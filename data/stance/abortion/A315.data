I'm attacking your illogical mind and your silly arguments! If that's a personal attack, then I guess that's what it is!  Ok so you're not calling for abortion to be outlawed, why then are you arguing for their side? You should argue for our side or at the very least choose the "it depends" option! I know you want to educate (as do I), so educate, and if that works out well in the future you won't find it necessary to ban abortion!  I'm not defending anybody with my outrageous suggestions. It's a solution to a problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. It has more educational value then a ban on abortion. Hit people where the pocket is and help them avoid a mistake in the future, don't make them pay for their mistake by forcing them to bring up a child. Forcing someone to keep a pet against their will can have dire consequences for the animal concerned, you get my point?  The only reality check here is that a ban on abortion simply doesn't work. It doesn't work to educate, it simply makes it ... what did you call it? ah yes... "the next underground drug".

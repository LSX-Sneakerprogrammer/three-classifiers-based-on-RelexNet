If you are a woman and have a brain you know that any birth control method can fail, unless she has had a hysterectomy. So the woman takes the chance, it is her decision, HER RESPONSIBILTY. It's not always about stupidity...but that does not chance the responsiblity part or the fact that says....a human life starts at conception.   Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion? Is the innocent child in the wombs life less than one in a womb who got there by a mother who was not raped? Do you think that if you walked into a hospital nursery and you were told that one babys mother had been raped...that you would be able to pick it out? Why does two acts of violence make sense? So the woman goes through the rape and then knowing she killed the child inside her. Do you know how mothers would cope with this extra trauma?   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die? Wow...how compassionate and materialist you are. ARe you perfect in appearence? Lets abort babies because they have problems.......Hitler had the same idea did you know that? He believed in killing the weak, the dredges of society. Again you are blaming the unborn for the sins of the parent. I have personally seen drug babies...and while they have a hard time at first...they can be saved and they can lead normal lives. You are making excuses for the killing.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks...the woman who wants to finish school, the woman who does know who the father is, the woman who does not want another child of that sex?   You know it is sad that you feel this way...that you would be so judgemental that to solve a problem you have to kill a living human being. That you would speak for another human who cant speak for themselves, and choose death. You are choosing death...for all the "what-if's"  What right do you have to determine how someone MIGHT LIVE?   What if you were poor....and the government said that everyone who made less than a certain amount couldn't have a child, that if you got pregnant you would have to abort because if you had one it would be a burdon on society. Would you be ok with that?  What did you mean by your comment...."life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)"? What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time?

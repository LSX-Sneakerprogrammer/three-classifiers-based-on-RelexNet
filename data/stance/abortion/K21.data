Why would you ever describe a human as a parasite. Apparently we are nothing but   but a bunch of disease ridden single celled organisms. First of all we cannot be parasites because we are multi-cellular organisms, an unborn baby is still a human, it is okay if it dies by natural causes but on purpose to kill it is just wrong.

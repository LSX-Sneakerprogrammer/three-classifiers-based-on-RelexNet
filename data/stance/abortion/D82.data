Abortion should be legal for it is ultimately the Mother's choice.  Don't criticize just because you're not going to be that poor unfortunate 16 year old girl who can't go to college and pursue her dreams because of a mistake.  Don't criticize because you're not the future father who is stuck paying welfare for 18 years.

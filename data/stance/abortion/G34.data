It is not what you care about. What you think or care about is different from the view of the laws.   I hope you remember this very quote in a few minutes, when I point out  again  that abortion is not considered homicide because the law does not recognize a fetus as a human being, therefor does not extend the same protections to it. The fact that you  think  abortion is murder has no influence on whether or not the law considers abortion to be murder.  As I said, the parasitism issue will no longer be addressed because you continue to ignore very basic evidence and qualified unbiased sources, in favor of presenting me with a page from a pro-life website.   You seem to be forgetting that the fetus not only has a human identity but a separate human identity which identifies the fetus as another human being.   When the fetus is inside the mother, it is inseparable from her system, and its lack of a fully formed or functioning brain prevents it from developing or retaining an identity.   The only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt. So why is it foolish? Organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being?    That is so far from the only difference between a fetus and a six month old baby.In the fetus, the brain does not even possess all its parts. That is where the organ comparison comes in. It has absolutely nothing to do with their potential; it has to do with capacity for awareness. In this case, the organ and the fetus have equal capacity for awareness: none.  Six month old babies are capable of feeling pain, reacting voluntarily to external stimuli, and their consciousness is not contested in any form. I actually think it is kind of monstrous to suggest abortion is in any way comparable to killing an infant, implying that women who get abortions are exactly the same as people who beat their infants to death.   Note that when I use fetus, I am not referring to all fetuses but to fetuses before the stage of viability, well before the thalamus is formed or functioning. A fetus beyond the point of viability is another matter, I think, as the interests of both the fetus and the mother could be preserved through an early delivery or c-section.   What do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America? Last time i had a conversation with a Judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses. And it is still in practice so where are you living in? In Fantasy America?   1. I already said I do not agree with this precedent and I think it is contradictory, again, unless the fetus is past the point of viability.  2. People who perform and receive abortions are not charged with homicide. How could this be true if fetuses were protected under homicide legislation?   It seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey. According to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual, the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity MUST be able to be distinguished from the dead. If this rule exists, then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life.   At no point did I contest any of the things you just mentioned. Why is this the third time you have repeated this? I have never said I think fetuses should be classify as dead. I have said numerous times I know they are alive. The fact that something is biologically classified as living is not what makes it a human life. Where is the disconnect? What do you not understand about this?   I am frustrated with your apparent refusal to understand simple statements, but please understand I am not asking the following question with the intent of being insulting or belittling. We are clearly having a problem understanding each other. Is English your first language?   If a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage, then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion. For an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not, there has to be intention to commit the action itself.   In order for one to determine whether a miscarriage was induced or spontaneous, they would have to investigate. Therefor, if a fetus was given the same rights as every other human, then every miscarriage would lead to an automatic investigation because every miscarriage could potentially be a murder. If it had been determined that the mother engaged in any activity that led to the miscarriage, even through negligence, she would be treated as though she contributed to the death of a human being, with all the legal punishment this entails.

Abortion is a disgusting thing. That's a fact. Performing unnecessary surgical procedures on people is a waste of time and valuable resources that could be put to better use elsewhere.  I don't think unnecessary abortions would be so commonplace if the fact of how disgusting they are wasn't hidden. The sheer magnitude of unnecessary abortions performed these days reflects the gross irreverence for life that is so pervasive. I'm not pro-life in the sense that I think abortions should be outlawed, but I am pro-life in that I see nothing wrong with working to reduce public acceptance of abortion as a form of birth control. I think that someone who claims to be a medical professional who performs procedures that are clearly unnecessary should be ashamed of themselves, and shunned by their peers.

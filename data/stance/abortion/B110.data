Abortion is right because the moral values that "pro life" advocates usually hold is that of religious sediments, most of the time disregarding whether or not abortion is helpful to society. Abortion prevents unwanted children, and or growth in areas where we most certainly wouldn't want it. Abortion increases happy family rates, and higher average level of education among families. A fetus is, for all intents and purposes, part of the women until removed from the women, and before any pro lifers try to mince those words I'll go outright and say yes it does mean I support the abortion of a child no matter the stage of development, an unwanted baby that couldn't be dealt with for whatever reason at one point weeks is no different from a unwanted baby at another. Ignorant religious people argue that such barbaric elimination of human life is evil, but I find it odd that they would object to something that would result in the immediate entry to heaven(by my knowledge Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all believe babies who die go straight to heaven). Why subject them to the hardships of life when they aren't wanted? I also agree with the fact that mothers should have the only say in whether or not she has an abortion( I also believe however that a man who wants an abortion but gets denied should have the right to be exempt from child support) My ideas on the subject go into extremes far beyond normal pro choice standards, but I honestly feel satisfaction in knowing I support something that is beneficial to society. And before anyone questions the lack of "morals" behind my believes just know that in our modern world, "morality" has no meaning, just different perceptions developed from our understanding of religion. Without religion there would be no such thing as "evil". I prefer to live in a world driven by logic, and to that point abortion is a logical way to better structure the family units in the world today.

A human life is not something to ditch. You may consider her an egotistical child but she apparently much smarter than you give her credit for. Show me where in the bible that god forgives deliberate, planned murder. If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation. If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world. When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.

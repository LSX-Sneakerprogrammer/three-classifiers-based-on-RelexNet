Katie, with all due respect, have you ever considered that legal abortions result in thousands of deaths...every week? Far more then when it is illegal. Humans after all come in many sizes....Don't you agree it's time to stop the mass-death-business of abortion? Drs make much faster money destroying life than delivering it. One takes nine mos. and many hours of labor... the other takes only a few minutes. Which do you think might attract the more talented , dedicated and professional Drs ? Can you even call them that when their purpose is to kill very little humans for big money, so people will not be inconvenienced ? "Hit" men might be a better name, based on what they truly do "legally". There are many loving people waiting to adopt, as you can plainly see in most news paper ads and by contacting any adoption agency. Should the innocent little ones CONTINUE to pay, for "life"styles, IE "death"styles?The abuse called Slavery ( which also made life more convenient for the ones in power)CHANGED thankfully, and which situation is really worse ?? So, there is hope that the ultimate child abuse and then killing of unborn babies in abortion will be stopped. Science makes it crystal clear now that this little life is a human being,and not an eagle etc. If however you kill an eagle egg there will likely be a fine !!

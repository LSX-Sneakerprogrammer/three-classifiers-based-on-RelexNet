Ok, the problem with jstantall is his belief system is clouding all of his arguments.  First of all, the fetus is only a potential life and is no comparison to the actual life that is the mother.   Secondly, we don't even need an excuse to get rid of a fetus if we don't want it. It's not as if the world's population is dwindling, we actually don't need any more unwanted babies coming into this world! We've got enough of the babies that are actually wanted and we also have enough of those who aren't wanted and have become a burden on society because of their natural tendencies to commit crimes, so if you want to save actual lives and not potential lives, then make wars illegal, make climbing Mt. Everest illegal, make motor racing illegal.

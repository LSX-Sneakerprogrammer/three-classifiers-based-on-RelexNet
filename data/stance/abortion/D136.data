"Why is it proven? Ah, b/c science says so."   Science relies on logical parsimony. Science does not say it, logic does. Faith is by definition contrary to proof, and thus reliability. Though both prove themselves in a way, Faith does so syllogistically.    "And science doesn't prove that the natural is the only thing, it only can speak about the natural."   There is only one true version of the natural world, however. Any version of the supernatural is speculative and one of many. The right religion could just as well be Scientology as Christianity.   "Besides, every law isn't based on a "proven theory". I'm not allowed to steal from you. What does that have to do w/science?"   The consolidation of public concensus on acceptable behavior is a science. Exegesis is not.  By the way, fetuses can't feel pain until 12 weeks old. EEG FTW

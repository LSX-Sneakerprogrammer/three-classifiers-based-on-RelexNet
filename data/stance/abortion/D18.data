//our Nation should not support such a decision made by a citizen.//  But your nation cannot make a legal decision to determine that a woman cannot form a choice for her own reproductive health. Would it be ok for you if your nation passed a law that stated everyone must give blood to save lives and they have the right to take your blood whether it's convenient for you or not? I mean, after all, you're saving a life, right, why should YOUR rights count?

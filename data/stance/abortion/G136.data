I know the way I would state my opinions would not prove helpful towards this discussion, so here is a quote, in place, by respected novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand. I find that this quote, in the end, sums up my opinions on this matter.  "An embryo has no rights. Rights do not pertain to a potential, only to an actual being. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living take precedence over the not-yet-living (or the unborn). Abortion is a moral rightâ€”which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her own body?"

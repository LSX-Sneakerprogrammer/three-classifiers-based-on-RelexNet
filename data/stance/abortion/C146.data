women have a very upsetting time when they have to decided to end a pregnancy, alot of thought goes into it, its not something that is planned over night. its the most heartbreaking decision you may need to ever make for you. for what ever reason this has to be done, the woman knows..she, her body has to deal with and face the painful descision.some may feel a weight has left their burden shoulders when its over, some can still miss what was growing inside them.some feel extreme guilt. but none jump for joy,some wish they didnt have to be in that position. some men are no support, some men may not understand why the women chooses this path..but remember one thing, judge if you must, but its not your body that goes through the changes, it not your body it is taking over. the women stands alone on this one, its her body her property.. alot of women cantcope with going through to birth. from the moment you find out your pregnant you should no wether or not you want it..birth control does not always work. things can happened, out of your control which can lead to pregnancy. either way it was the right descisian for them.. they have to live with their feelings afterwards.. they need to forgive themselfs, and god will do the same....

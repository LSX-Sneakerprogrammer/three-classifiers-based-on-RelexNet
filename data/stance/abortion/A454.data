They are not children, so stop victimizing the people exercising their rights to keep or not to keep a fetus. You people are exactly the reason why women suffer from depression and guilt!   I propose we outlaw the systematic bullying by pro-life people. We should treat their bullying behaviour with the same disdain and disgust we treat schoolyard bullies. Leave the women alone, they have the rights to determine what's to be done to their own bodies.

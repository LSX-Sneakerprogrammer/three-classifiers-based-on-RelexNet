It's not a sentient being.   I never disputed this. I asked if, on your view, the retarded, senile, and comatose are all in the same boat as fetuses as none of them are self-aware and some are not feeling.   It is the woman's body.   It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body, but it in no way is a part of her body. In the same way a splinter is in my body but not a part of my body. The fetus is not an organ of the mother.   It is none of your business what another does with their body.   It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder.   Only religious superstition.   I haven't once made a religious statement here. I've only given statements from biology.   One of the reasons your religion is so evil and dangerous when weilded by most of you, you cannot even see your own totalitarian views on morality should you be given enough power in any situation to control others, and you will literally make-up bullshit like your argument to justify it.   Cool red herring and ad hominem.   If god doesn't like it let him come tell people otherwise. Until then tell your fellow christians to stop with the abortion doctor death threats and scaring girls on their way to clinics.   Only if you actually answer the one question I've asked and stick with biology instead of emotion.   If god is all powerful he's killing more fetuses than every abortion doctor combined.   You really enjoy ruddy fish.  So can I get an answer to my question up top now?

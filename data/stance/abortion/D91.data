An example of a post by someone who does not understand science.  THE FOETUS (UK SPELLING) IS NOT ALIVE, it cannot be asked on its rights and has no nervous system, there is a greater need in the social aspects and it is inane to suggest that there is murder in something which saves the money, time, and essentially life of the mother.  The mother keeps the rights, not the child.

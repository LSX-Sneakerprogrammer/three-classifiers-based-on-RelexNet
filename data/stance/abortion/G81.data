You got frustrated with Avesked (however his name spelled) and banned him. That is just like abortions. Your were unprepared for Avesked intelligent rebuttals, and aborted him. This is just like abortion, but slightly worse, because Avesked is a human and can tell whats going on. A fetus is neither human (yet), nor can tell whats going on.   I can't wait till I get banned.

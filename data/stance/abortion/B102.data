It has nothing to do my with my  approval . I'm using negative circumstance as an example as to why a woman might abort.  Not a few weeks earlier I do believe the youngest was 22 weeks. I'm not arguing that, which leads me to believe you DO NOT read the arguments people make! I think the latest gestation for abortion should be lowered.  Here you go Mr. Science.  Most scientists agree that pain is experienced in the cortical areas of the brain, which do not develop until the second trimester. Painful experiences result in autonomic (they occur automatically during pain) physiologic changes that can be measured. For example, when we fell pain, our bodies produce endorphins and cortisol to help deal with the pain. One study was conducted on fetuses during blood draws. This study showed elevated fetal plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin response to intrauterine needling early in the second trimester but not before.  So the first trimester is an ideal time for abortion which is when most occur anyway. It's extended mostly for medical reasons as some deformities and disabilities cannot be detected until the second trimester which is a time I will agree the woman has a right to an abortion in the second trimester.

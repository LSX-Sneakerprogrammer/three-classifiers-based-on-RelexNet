But you are wrong…it is you just don't hear about it. And if you are pro-choice then…what is the problem with it? Do you not want to be put on the spot during the Super bowl if someone in your group says wow…who could be for that? Then you would have to say well I condone it…I am pro-choice? Or you could sit there and hide your opinion and just agree so you don't look bad.   I don't have to look it up. Have you ever heard of Tiller…the doctor that was killed for doing late term abortions? He did them like this as do clinics all over the country. YOU DONT HEAR ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY HIDE IT…IT IS ILLEGAL. It is done. Last year alone two late term abortion clinics were shut down…one in LA and one in New Mexico. It is done and you are very naive if you think it isn't. And as I said…..is there something wrong with abortion Saurbaby? If you are pro-choice it should be legal because your position stands on the fact that no woman should have to carry something if she does not want to do it. That would enslave her. So if she wants an abortion say at eight months….it should be ok.   The picture is accurate and true. You yourself said in this post…."Abortion is not done like that ANYMORE." Which….LOL implies that you know it was done and the picture is accurate.  Did you know that in that tiny clump of cells…22 days after conception when most women don't even know they are pregnant…the heart starts beating. Yea…in that blob you think is nothing.  What is the abortionists goal?

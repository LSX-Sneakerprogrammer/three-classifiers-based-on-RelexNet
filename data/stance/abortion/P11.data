I am only saying that abortion involves the killing of an innocent human being.   That is not completely true. You are assuming that the fetus is an innocent human being. Furthermore, even if I agree with you that the assumption is true, there is no reason on your part to suggest that abortion is wrong.   If you believe that it is morally acceptable to kill innocent human beings, that is morality for you. No one can "prove" morality to someone who does not accept certain basic warrants.   That is a lazy answer. This is exactly why I am asking you to provide reasons to support your unasserted claims.

1. Funguses, viruses, bacteria, etc all also take nourishment from mothers (and all humans) so nourishment is a non-point.  2. Just because your a mom doesn't mean you know the feelings of every other mom or would be mom in the world. I know plenty of women who have had abortions and are fine with it. Obviously if you are thinking of abortion as killing a little kid you are going to be against it.  But lets say there are women who consider that thing growing in them for the first 3 months nothing more than a cluster of cells? I mean, there is no evidence otherwise. You may  believe  there is some magic daddy in the sky giving this thing a soul, but she disagrees with you on that and you have no proof otherwise.  She is not  forcing  you to have abortions. Why should you be allowed to  force  her not to?  Seems kind of selfish.

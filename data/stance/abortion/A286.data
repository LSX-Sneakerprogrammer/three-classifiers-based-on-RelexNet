waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justification   It is proper justification for me and a lot of other people. Because with a potential life, we're not commiting murder. Like I said, we're stuck on the "potential" VS "definite" point.  .   If being thick and asleep keeps me from killing innocent humans in the early stages of development and makes me outraged at their slaughter than I'm guilty as charged and wear those names with honor   I hope you're a vegan as well. It would make sense, since eating meat would mean that you're ending lives. If you're a meat eater, you might say "oh it's not human, so it's ok" but others will say "how dare you discriminate towards other species"... but you should be ok living with them hassling you because you hassle others pretty much the same way.

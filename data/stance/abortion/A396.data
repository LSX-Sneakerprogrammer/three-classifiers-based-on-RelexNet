are you suggesting that abortions are already "outside the law"?   No.....I was responding to the post that "people will just get illegal abortions anyway" I was simply pointing out that is not a good reason to keep or make something legal.  "Besides, making certain recreational drugs legal allow certain societies to control it better"  Considering these drugs are NOT legal, you have no proof to back that statement up. Secondly, you cannot compare the 2. Abortions would most likely go down if it was illegal as most people would be too scared to do them illegally.

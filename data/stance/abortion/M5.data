"Life" please specify what you mean by the word "life". technically a fetus is indeed alive, a zygote is alive.   Souls as supernatural things do not exist, or if you would prefer the less strong statement are not falsifiable or observable.  Free will does not exist, it is non-sensical and thus to say a unborn child has never conducted its own decisions only instinctive actions is to say it has done only what any of us can do.   Before conception, during it, after it etc Life never wasn't during a "successful pregnancy". 2 haploids of two different beings came together, forming a third being. keep in mind a being is distinct from person.

Sorry I'm not used to the formatting here. Thanks for the tip.   I think it's quite obvious that once the umbilical cord is cut, it is independent of its host.   Not at all. The baby still cannot feed itself. Left alone it will die, unlike even an older child who could forage for food. Newborns and young children have no such ability.   Well, so will anything. I don't see what relevance this poses.   Not true. Older children and adults can survive on their own. They can gather their own food and water and find or make shelter.   Yes, but it isn't a fetus then. I'm not a 13 year old fetus.   You are, in the same way I'm a 22 year old child. These are just names we give to certain stages of our growth. The point is that while we have different titles for different stages of life, all of those titles are still titles of humans. The difference between a child and an adult is stage of development, as is the difference between a fetus and adult.   But at this point, it's extremely difficult to say that it is truly human.   It fits the biological definition of life and has an individual human genetic code. It is biologically classified as an individual human being.   A fetus cannot do this, thus scientifically, it is not fully human.   Neither can a child nor someone who is asexual by defect. Are they not fully human on your view?   But she can't reproduce asexually, right?   Her cells reproduce like everyone else's. She cannot, however make another human life through sexual reproduction. Think of it this way: She's a human female who has a hormone abnormality such that she has no womb or vagina. She is incapable of ever having a child because she lacks these necessary reproductive parts.   I for one, would be seething if I had given that man perks for doing absolutely nothing builderly-like whatsoever. And I would also be incensed if I had to give full human rights to something that isn't human yet, just "working on it."   Your analogy doesn't represent what's going on. Let's move from redesigning a kitchen to building a house. The same scenario happens, and you come in asking what he's done with the kitchen. He says he's done nothing with the kitchen yet, however he's laid the foundation and started constructing the walls. It would be silly to expect a fetus to make reproductive organs before other things like a heart, skin, etc.   A newborn is independent of its host. A fetus is not able to be until the third trimester.   See first point.   But it's not the mother's fault she was raped. The rapist had no right to harm her.   You're right. However that in no way gives her the right to harm the baby. That's like stealing someone's wallet because someone else stole yours - it makes no sense.   The right to choose what she does with her body.   But she's not killing her own organ. She's not getting an ear pierced or anything. She's choosing what to do with the baby's body, not hers. She's killing the individual life inside her, not one of her own organs or tissues.   The right to choose.   To choose what, though? To end the life of another who has not wronged anyone? Isn't that the very definition of murder? I agree the mother should be able to do whatever she wants with her own body, but the baby is not a part of her - it's just geographically located in her for the time being.   I must say, that was a very refreshing and innovative take on the question.   Thank you.

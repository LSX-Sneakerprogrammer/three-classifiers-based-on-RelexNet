So great .. if a fetus isn't a person, if someone is deemed not responsible enough to raise a child (say a woman convict who wants the child) then it should be fine to force the abortion on her right? It should be like not allowing her to have a car. "Oh don't worry, it wasn't a real life anyhow, off you go."

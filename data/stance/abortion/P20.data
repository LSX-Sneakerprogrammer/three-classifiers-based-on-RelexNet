From my atheist perspective, I can't even catch a glimpse of the logic behind any rejection of abortion. It's simply being humane to rape-victims and families that can't afford bringing up several children, and it may help us to keep the population growth under some control. Prevention and abortion are, ironically worded, a godsend!

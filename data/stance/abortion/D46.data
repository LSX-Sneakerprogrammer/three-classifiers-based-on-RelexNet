I believe it should be legal up to the end of the first trimester, as this is when it is plausible that the fetus will experience pain if it were to be aborted. Before this the "being", if you will, is not conscious nor can it suffer it's destruction in any way, so why is it such a moral issue? If you think it is "human" from the moment of conception then I must assume that you are at least misinformed. A fly is a more complex living thing than a blastocyst (day 3 of pregnancy). It seems to me then that we should make the killing of insects illegal too.  I highly recommend Sam Harris' "Letter to a Christian Nation" For those here that are fully opposed to any kind of abortion.

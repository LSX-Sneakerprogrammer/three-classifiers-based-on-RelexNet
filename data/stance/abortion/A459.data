some ignorant people (mostly men, of course). for women, how would you feel if you didn't want to have a child and an accident happened, with a condom or birth control or anything else. what if abortion was illegal? because procreation is such a burden on women anyway, between periods, pregnancy, and the birth, don't you think that women should at least have a choice? (By the way: if you want to talk about the baby being alive as it's a growing egg, well here's the thing, everything on this is formed with cells and bacteria so think about that next time you shoot a deer or something.)

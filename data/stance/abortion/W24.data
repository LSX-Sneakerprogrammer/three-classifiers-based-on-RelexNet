"I believe we all have souls, completely independent of religion."   Oh, come on. How could you possibly say that without bringing religion into the debate?   "I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting."   We've been over this. The regret could come from not having a kid when she had the chance. But that's no reason to ban abortion. The regret could come from going against the Christian values she was raised with. But again, that's no reason to ban abortion. There are many women who get abortions and feel no regret whatsoever.   "With the populations we have, each abortion does not have a huge impact, but each one takes away a genetically unique individual."   Heh. By that logic, women should be required to pump out as many kids as possible.

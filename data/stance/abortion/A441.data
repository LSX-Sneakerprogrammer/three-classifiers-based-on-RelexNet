As much as I'm against it and think what a horrible feeling and decision that must be for the women, abortion should not be banned altogether. We would go back to the dark ages where doctors and their patients would have "back alley abortions". 3rd trimester should be illegal that's just wrong. It is a very hard topic that I struggle with. Ultimately the choice lies within the women. But what a awful one to make, they will live with it for the rest of their life.

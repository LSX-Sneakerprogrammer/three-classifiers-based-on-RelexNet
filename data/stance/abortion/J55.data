It's just a tad more deep seated than an opinion...   I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics and it's not actually a sentiment I disagree with, but that something is disgusting  to you  only a fact if you specify that. Disgust is subjective no matter how widely it is shared.   Perhaps in the mind of someone considering one when there are better options.   What makes an option better than abortion? Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   Anything we deem to be necessary is representative of a decision we've already made...it's a specific conclusion we've come to in that other possible courses of events are excluded from consideration.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   The only reason abortions are performed is that we don't realize better alternatives...   First, I am willing to operate on whatever definition of necessary you are using. You used it once in one way, and once in another way. If we've established you're not using logical necessity, that's fine.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options. What are you using to support this claim? Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Sorry, I left out "improving". I'm sure you wouldn't dispute that those type of surgeries have health benefits. I think you're straining at gnats here.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.   If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact, but I think this still excludes abortion. Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    I may not be able to convince you, but there are plenty of occasions where pregnancy and childbirth result in a stronger more healthy woman.   As it is a difficult experience, I don't doubt makes some women stronger. It could also break her or ruin her life if she can't deal with it, or if her life simply has no room for the resources pregnancy requires. There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.  I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not. You and I are both in situations that we could undoubtedly complicate by taking on more responsibilities or demands, but we haven't because we're aware that we have our limits and everything will suffer if we overextend ourselves. Is that unacceptable?    If the burden of proof was on you, I suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre-pregnancy level.   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.  The most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness. A negative impact on mental health is rare. It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/3/gpr090308.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/safety_of_abortion.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                        facts/post_abortion_issues.html

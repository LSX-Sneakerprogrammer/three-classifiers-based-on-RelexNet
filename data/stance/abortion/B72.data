"We don't even abort animals like we do our own human children"  As a former veterinary technician, I can tell you that you're quite mistaken. Many dogs and cats are brought into the vets office to be "spayed" in late stages of pregnancy. The pups/kits that are removed with the uterus are usually killed immediately by breaking their necks or by lethal injection. Horrific, yes it is. But beats the heck out of the alternative, having even more unwanted pets in the streets and shelters.   I don't like having to choose a side that says "abortion is right" because I don't think it is. But I do absolutely believe in the right of a woman to choose an abortion if she and her doctor believe it is the best choice for her. Sometimes an abortion is the lesser of two evils - and I don't think anyone but a woman and her doctor should be allowed to make that decision for her.

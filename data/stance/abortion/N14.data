This is retarded.  It's not a sentient being.  It is the woman's body.  It is none of your business what another does with their body.  You want to justify forcing your morality on others, and are reaching for quazi-logic to do it. There is no logic in it though. Only religious superstition. One of the reasons your religion is so evil and dangerous when weilded by most of you, you cannot even see your own totalitarian views on morality should you be given enough power in any situation to control others, and you will literally make-up bullshit like your argument to justify it. "It's alive" - yeah I know, but not sentient. "Human DNA" - yeah, I know but not sentient. "Your changing the argument" - still not sentient "Stick to the facts" - nope, still not sentient.   It's silly.  If god doesn't like it let him come tell people otherwise. Until then tell your fellow christians to stop with the abortion doctor death threats and scaring girls on their way to clinics.   Also you don't make a distinction between killing something and that thing dying of natural causes? Really?   lmao. You're not? If god is all powerful he's killing more fetuses than every abortion doctor combined.

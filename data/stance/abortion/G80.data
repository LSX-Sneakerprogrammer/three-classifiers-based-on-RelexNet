But it is growing into a human being? Am i right or wrong? You should understand that these cells are different from the other cells within our body. Cells that are developing with it's own genetic uniqueness and has its own DNA and blood type. Then why do the laws protects that very mass of cells by recognizing the homicide of a fetus as a separate offense if it is unworthy of human rights according to you?  Well that case i am referring to has a lot to do with this debate because it is a dispute on whether or not life begins at conception and it is a scientific controversy which resulted in the court ruling that life begins at conception after hearing arguments from both sides. So does a person who has Alzheimer is also not self aware which is why they are described as being in the baby stage? Well let us consider adoption instead of abortion and stop making it seem as if abortion is the only way out. Who is responsible for bringing them into existence? Did they asked to be brought into existence or to be related?

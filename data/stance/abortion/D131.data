Maybe the one who referred to the Freakonomics theory of abortion never finished the chapter, because at the end he goes on to compare how many deaths were spared by allowing abortion, vs how many prebirth baby deaths were caused by abortion. Even if you "value" an unborn baby's life as only being worth a tiny fraction of a live human's life, abortion still ends far more lives than it saves!

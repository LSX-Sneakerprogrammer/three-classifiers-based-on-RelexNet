We waste resources all the time in this country - plastic surgery.   That we currently do is no argument that we ought to continue.   It is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child (even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events, let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources)   If you want to represent prenatal care or the rearing of a child as a waste of resources, I'll leave the untruth of that as self evident.   Most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately, this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence, or if it is, it is very small.   I have a different hunch about these things than you, but I also suspect we can only contrast our opinions here sans any kind of statistical evidence.   Saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people.   I don't think so.   A lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences.   I am not arguing against the small fraction of abortions that are medically necessary.   There are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations.    I think I am, considering that most abortions are not by necessity but by choice.   The father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body.   There is no legal basis to support the importance of a fathers right to protect his unborn child.   You cant force people without violating their sovereignty (which i describe as the foundation of morality).    I could argue that a woman who willingly engages in the sort of sexual relations that commonly result in pregnancy should thereby confer certain legal rights to the father. It's the beginning of a shared responsibility so there should be shared commensurate rights. If a woman can legally compel a man to be held responsible after birth, he should have some legal say prior to.   Moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value - this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions.   No disagreement from me there.   Complex ethical generalizations (a theoretically codified moral state of mind [having explicit opinions]) is attained when people are older, but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue - this begins when consciousness is established.   To the contrary...Living beings that don't meet your imaginary criteria, merit protection due to moral concerns. For instance if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents.   A person is not really a person untill they are conscious, otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings - the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness.  Consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious - once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc... This has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value (the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness).    Having morality based reasons to protect a life form, does not depend on the life form in question being conscious. Even if you could give a logically sound explanation of what consciousness is.

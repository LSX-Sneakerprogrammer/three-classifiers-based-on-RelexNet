attn Jstabtall:  do you live in some kinda warped universe  "Abstinence is the only practice that provides 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy, nothing else comes close."  can you show me a culture or a time in human history where society has instituted functional, workable, effective abstinence policy  yes - your proposal works in an ideal world were everyone has exactly the same thoughts and actions but that world does NOT exist

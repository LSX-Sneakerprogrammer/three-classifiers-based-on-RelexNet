Iâ€™m not defending myself nor my viewpoint, I am boldly declaring the implications of the pro-abortionist. You must understand that if I am truly anti-abortionist, I will not waste time dancing and playing with individuals who promote the killing of human fetuses. I did not come for a fight as you have claimed, what I came for was an intellectual abortion of anti-fetus rhetoric.   The undebatable? There's no such thing.  Every issue is debatable.  (Self-refuting argument)  I am not God, the creator of the heavens and Earth. Would you care to debate or find someone to debate that proposition?   Again, No man is a woman.  Again, No horse is a dog.  Again, No debate is a fetus.  Again, 1 is not 4  Again, 1 and 1 is not 7  Again, 2 and 10 is 2 less than 14  Again, Man is fallible.

it's a living organ like any other organ inside the woman's body.   Then why does it have it's own unique DNA? And what's the point of the fetal sack? Why all the complex systems to isolate the fetus from the mothers body? No serious doctor holds this position; the data doesn't remotely support it.   Once it reaches the stage   I did have it right when I said your view decides when a life is worthy of life and when a life is unworthy of life. You just said it right there. And here is a list of all the words you use in making this distinction; Until, Once, then, before.  And about this notion of "potential life!" by all the standard definitions of life, it's alive and has been throughout, potentiality is a farce.  And finally were do you get this arbitrary standard of survival and person hood? You see I don't discriminate; If it's human, and it is, then it deserves our full protection. The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be the womb.

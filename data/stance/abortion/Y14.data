Of course it should be banned. Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation. At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life. But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children, it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion. It equals genocide - on a massive, massive scale. My position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal.

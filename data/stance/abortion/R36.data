Well hey, it has the potential to do all those things. You can't know it wont. Why is a sperm suddenly too precious to let die just because it meets an egg? Especially when any other sperm can do the same damn thing.   Sperm and fetus are the same, the only difference is a fetus is a few steps closer to being birthed. You're older than me, probably a few steps closer to making your own children than I am. Is your life worth more than mine? Surely you must think so. A fetus is closer to being born than a sperm, just as you are closer to creating a fetus than I am. You're one step farther on the chain, so, is it alright for people like me to die en masse as long as you get to live?  And furthermore, I am farther along the chain of life than a fetus. I am much more capable of creating life than a fetus. I have much more potential at this time. Sure, the fetus has the potential to one day be like me, but right now it is not. That means it's worth less right? Is it o.k. to abort millions of un-born children but not o.k. to kill me?   No? But at the same time, you say it is o.k. to let millions of sperm die, but wrong to kill a fetus. Why? Because one is farther down the road of life than the other? Or is the life of a fetus worth more than any other conceivable form of life?

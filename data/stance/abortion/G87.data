Really? Then if it's about a woman's right to control her own body, then why is it that the laws forbid her from controlling her own body when it comes to prostitution or the use of drugs? How come you guys are saying that a woman should have her own right to control her body but yet the laws prohibits us from committing suicide, the use of drugs or even prostitution? Doesn't these have to do with everybody's right to control their own body too?

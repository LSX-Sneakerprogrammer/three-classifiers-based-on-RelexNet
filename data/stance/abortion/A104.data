I would just like to add one more thing. Everyone who is for abortion seems to insist this should solely be the woman's decision. Why is that? What about the father? Why should he have no say in a child that he would have to bear legal responsibility to if it were born?  Suppose, a father says he does not want the child and she has it anyway. He is still legally liable to this child. Now, suppose the opposite. He wants the child, is willing to raise this child without any financial support from the mother and is willing to bear all financial burden of the mother while she is unable to work. He should not have this right?

Women have a right to do what they want with their body.   Yes they do, but the child inside of them is not part of their body it is a separate living being.   What if a women is raped and gets pregnant? so she just has to live with a messed up child?   This scenario does happen, however, it is much rarer that most believe, most abortions are from irresponsible sex but regardless it is still no reason to kill a human.   The fetus is not really sentient until it comes out   It is arguable that they are not conscious, however, just because they aren't does not mean they are not alive or do not matter.

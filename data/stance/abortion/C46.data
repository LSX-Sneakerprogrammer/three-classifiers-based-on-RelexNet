Utter unsubstantiated nonsense.  Or Bullsh t as you americans say.  Unless of course you know something most neurologists and other medical scientists do not? *  What does it mean to feel? Beyond simple taxis and kinesis what is there to the experience? There are emotional consequences for the stimuli, there is introspection towards the stimuli, there is the actual feeling itself, and there may be long-term memory of the event.  I do not believe it possible that a foetus has developed all of these aspects of feeling yet, when an infant appears to lack them except in the most rudimentary stages.

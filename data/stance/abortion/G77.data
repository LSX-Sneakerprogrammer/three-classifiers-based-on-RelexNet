Well yeah you are right but read up on the case which The U.S Supreme Court ruled that life begins at conception.   Life does not mean "a life" as in a person worthy of human rights.   I think that is wrong in the whole to take a life.   Don't scratch yourself then, you kill life in the form of skin cells.   How many of us would even be here today if our parents had chosen abortion for us regardless of poverty or unpreparedness.   A lot fewer, and we'd have less poverty, slums, crime and overpopulation if people aborted rather than raise a child unprepared.

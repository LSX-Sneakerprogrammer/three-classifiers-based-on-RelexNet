" With the exception of red blood cells... EVERY SINGLE LAST CELL IN THE HUMAN BODY has all the chromosomes in human DNA. "  And sex cells. ;) But besides that, that wasn't my point. I know how many chromosomes are in a human somatic cell. My point is that and arm is not a human being because it is part of the whole. And tongue is only a  part  of a human as well, not the whole thing.  So even though each of these body parts is not a human, the organism that they make up is a human being. Your toenail clippings might not have personhood, but that's because your toenail clippings are not complete bodies, merely parts.

Abortion invleves killing a living human being, so it is definitely wrong. But I don't think the penal law is the most efficient way to keep the number of abortions down. We should do more to help young and/or poor women and girls whon get pregnant instead. Welfare queens are a lesser evil than killing innocent human beings.

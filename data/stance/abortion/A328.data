Taking the life of another person   . . . is not what happens in an abortion, because a fetus is not a "person."   Roe  didn't strip any class of "people" of rights, because a fetus is not a person.  Nothing about the abortion right is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a fetus is not a person.   Never  in the history of U.S. law has a fetus been a "person," and a fetus is not a "person" under the law of the EU either.  Are you getting the part where you went wrong yet?

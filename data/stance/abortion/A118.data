That sounds like YOUR solution to a minority of people. Don't you dare make everyone abide by the minority's rules. If it was a simple answer, it wouldn't be such a huge issue.   Abortion isn't a form of birth control like condoms or the pill, for those directly involved it's a difficult choice that they have to make because bringing a human life up is no easy task. It's not like having a pet (and even that is a big ask because not all pet owners are responsible).  Again, it's the choice of those directly involved. It doesn't affect anybody else's life, so leave it alone.

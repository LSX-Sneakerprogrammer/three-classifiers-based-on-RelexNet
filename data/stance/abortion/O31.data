I suppose some conjoined twins should be able to kill each other at will with impunity...   With conjoined twins, the ownership of the body can be disputed. They share bones and organs; it is not a clear-cut case of one separate but dependent organism residing in another. I know there is physiological variation with conjoined twins, but take Abigail and Brittany Hensel as an example:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Abigail_and_Brittany_Hensel    How can one sister make a claim to the shared organs at the expense of the other sister? They own them equally. I don't believe a fetus can be said to own any part of the mother's body  at all , much as less as much as the mother does.  Also, parents are often given the option to separate the twins even when it will almost certainly kill one of them. They can make a decision, on behalf of one child, to kill his/her twin "at will with impunity."    Should parents have the right to kill their infants, toddlers, teenagers and etc because parents must labor(perhaps at an unenjoyable job) for their children? What about the children's physical autonomy?   If a parent wants to end their commitment to an infant, toddler, teenager, etc., why resort to killing them? They can disown them, and the commitment is terminated without impinging on physical autonomy.    Rather, if mandatory organ donations from the living were passed into law, the goverment would be saying that the sick has a greater physical autonomy than the healthy.   Yes, I did mean mandatory organ harvesting from living individuals.   To dispense with unnecessary health qualifiers, it would be saying that one person's physical autonomy is less important than another person's life. I do not see how this is distinguishable from abortion; both are cases where, if one party's physical autonomy is removed, another party's life could be preserved. Except, in the case of abortion, the benefiting party is not a person yet.

People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society.   But prior to this, they can. Besides, we know that they are human beings anyway. They are independent of a natural host, and would be able to do the things I specified if they weren't afflicted by a condition. My concern is that I doubt a fetus could do those things regardless of condition.    is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance.   Not until the third trimester, in which abortion is illegal anyway. A fetus cannot do any of the things I specified maximally, if at all, prior to the third trimester. It is, by definition, a parasite until about 20 weeks or so.    how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?   Because I obviously disagree that a fetus can do those things.   It's not sexual reproduction, no, but that's not what the definition refers to.   I know that. But when we are talking about defining  human  life, the sexual one is the only definition that matters.    Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive.   I'm not disputing that they are alive. I'm disputing on the grounds that asexual reproduction is not human, which is all that needs to be considered. Thus, a fetus does not have all the biological features you or I have from the moment of conception. It also lacks many other things, but those aren't necessary for me to disagree with your premises.   I am against abortion in all but life-or-death cases.   A few hypothetical scenarios then..   1.  A mother has been raped. Yay or nay to abortion, and why?   2.  The mother will suffer serious health problems if she carries to full term. Yay or nay?   3.  The baby will suffer serious health problems when birthed. Yay or nay?   4.  A train is heading down a track. If not diverted, it will kill a fetus (hypothetically speaking). You can divert the train, but if you do, it will kill a woman. You know nothing about either subject. What do you do?

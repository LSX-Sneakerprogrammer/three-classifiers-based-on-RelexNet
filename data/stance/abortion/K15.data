so what if it doesn't have a brain yet still is going to get one and still has a whole future in front of him/her.     No brain = no life. We don't care about what might happen, we care about present reality. By the way, why do you care about preserving life? You're a Christian fundamentalist. Shouldn't you be out burning witches, nonbelievers, and homosexuals?

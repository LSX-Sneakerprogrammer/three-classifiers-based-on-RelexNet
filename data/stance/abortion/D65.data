The only real advocacy for pro-life is the thought of killing a child. It's living tissue I'll give you that, but would you have a C-section at 2 months and call it a birth? No. Because it's not truly a being yet, is it?  And if you're going to make the argument that stopping a child from existing is murder, in that case, sex without procreation is murder, or for that matter, not deciding to have a child at any point is murder.  The only event horizon would be life at conception. That's purely a religious claim. A conscious human being cannot be contained within 2 cells.

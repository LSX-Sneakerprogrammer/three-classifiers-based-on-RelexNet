Friend, it has nothing to do with you unless you can keep it alive yourself. Before the fetus turns at least 20 weeks old, it has no chance of survival outside of the mother's womb. This means she alone should have the choice. You should not butt in just because of your own feelings. Consider other people's feelings, consider the people who are directly affected by this. They should have the choice to keep the pregnancy or not before it turns 20 weeks. If you can't keep it, then butt out! It's not an infant, it's merely a POTENTIAL life, which is in the same category as an egg or sperm on its own.

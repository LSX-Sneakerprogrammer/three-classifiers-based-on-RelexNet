Abortion is the killing of a child. No one should be willfully killed, be it at 1 week or 100 years. When I had my first ultrasound with my son, I was 5 weeks pregnant, which means I had become pregnant 3 weeks prior. My son had a heartbeat. How can anyone anyone anyone stop a beating heart on purpose? Your decision should happen BEFORE you find yourself in this position. If it is ok to abort, why do those who do so end up so destroyed for the rest of their lives? It's because they know they killed a human and that will rest on their hearts for life. If only their child had such an opportunity. For those of you who wrote that there is no God, and were angered by such a defense, I will pray for you. Because without faith, you really have nothing.

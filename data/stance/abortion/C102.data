I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    I am sure everyone who is capable of making that choice would make the same decision as you. Fetuses are incapable of making decisions, therefor they have no say in whether or not they get aborted.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.   The choice to engage in sexual activity is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term in the same way that the choice to engage in smoking is not synonymous with the choice to allow lung cancer to proceed without treatment.  PS: This is really sanctimonious and judgmental. Try to work on that.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it.   Sure, she can. Or, she can get an abortion, and they can adopt a different baby from the overflowing foster care system.   yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her,    How does any one person's ability to perform a medical procedure influence whether it should be permitted? Do you have the will or education to perform brain surgery? If not, should we make brain surgery illegal?   if it isnt alive then why bother?   Why do you and other pro-life advocates insist on thinking anyone is claiming a fetus is not alive? Clearly it is not inanimate or dead. It is just incapable of consciousness, therefor does not deserve the rights of a conscious individual. Under the law, killing a fetus does not count as taking the life of a person.  Alive  and  a person's life  are different concepts.   Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.   Since you later refer to abortion as the act of cutting a baby from someone, I am assuming you are one of the ones who considers abortion to be synonymous with the act of murdering a helpless infant. If so, this statement equates to 'Murdering a helpless infant is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.'   This doesn't sound right to me. Is it wrong, or not? If the end result is no different for the fetus, why would motive or circumstance make a difference?   I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.   Would you still laugh if the orchestrator of the largest genocide in history were to be aborted?

Sure the law protects you to have your own beliefs, but what gives you the right to force your beliefs on others? What if others hold different beliefs, should they still be influenced by your religious decisions? How about if it was the other way around and you were legally forbidden from doing ceratin things because someone of a different faith beleived that their god thought it was wrong?  No one is saying you don't have a right to your opinion, but if you don't want your views challenged, don't come on a debate website.

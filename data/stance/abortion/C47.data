Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Plant cells of a fruit are alive but they are not part of an independent & unique multicellular organism.  Fruits are not multicellular organisms, in the traditional scientific sense...they are a part of an organism...my testes are composed of living cells that respire and excrete but i do not consider them independant animals of their own right...  This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...  Now do you realise how illogical your absurd argument is?

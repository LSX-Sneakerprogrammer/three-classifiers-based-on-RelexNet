I am 100% pro-abortion for reasons outlined in my previous argument. I have not been disputed and therefore the winning position is pro-choice. Clicking a button to raise a point counter is a shoddy voting method that by no means reflects winning vs losing positions.   To summarize, only when you view reincarnation as untrue does abortion mean death. Otherwise it means denying one of many chances to be born. I will support the pro-reincarnation standpoint (prove it wrong I dare you) and say that stopping a rape-baby or a 15 year old mother- baby from having a real chance at life is a crime against humanity perpetrated by fundamental extremists who have nothing better to do than bitch about the lifestyles of others.   -If you care about human life so much, protest the war in iraq you ignorant tools spouting off the memes your parents instilled.   -A fetus doesn't have the same rights that a fully developed human does, but that doesn't stop religious fanatics and "humanists" from bitching a thousand times louder when it involves a being only arguably alive.   -If you view anything with a heart as important, why do you enslave and beat and choke collar and shock collar your pets YOU HYPOCRITICAL MORONS.  -If every pro-life woman was raped and impregnated, the female pro-life support would dwindle.  Dispute me.

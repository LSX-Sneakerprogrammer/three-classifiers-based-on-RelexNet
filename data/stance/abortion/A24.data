Since I disagree with you so often I will snip out some portions of what you typed that I do agree with:   I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union    the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good.   See I don't disagree with you completely.

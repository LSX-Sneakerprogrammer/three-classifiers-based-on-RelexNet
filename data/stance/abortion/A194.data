This is what I derive from your argument:  "We should not outlaw abortion, we should outlaw unprotected sex. This is because we want to prevent children from coming into this Earth, or kill them off should accidents happen."  This system is complete and utter BS, and would do more harm than good.  If we wanted to prevent children from being born, we should educate, and provide more condoms and help encourage abstinence among teenagers and couples. This way, we can eventually move past outlawing unprotected sex and stop abortions for good.  What you suggest does nothing to promote any form of childbirth. It doesn't give a single solution that doesn't cause more problems.

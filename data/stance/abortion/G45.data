For your information why don't you read up on an important case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services which upheld that life begins at conception and this view was also supported by doctors. Isn't the fetus referred to as a developing human being?   I'm more interested in science, I.E. knowledge of nature, than legal rulings which are a matter of politics.  If you don't have a functioning body that can exist on its own, it follows that you lack developed organs, and even more importantly a developed brain. This means you lack awareness of your own life.  It would be nice if you researched the developmental stages of fertilisation through foetal development, and birth. Then you might appreciate the fact that while a fertilised egg is alive, it isn't a life, or at least not worthy of being granted the rights of a born human life.  The whole issue that you are so passionate about is actually over the killing of fertilised eggs and tiny, unaware foetuses.   The whole concept is that the fetus posses life and if the fetus comes from the family of homosapiens which in other words is referred to as human beings then don't that make it a human being also or a plant?   If you're going to grant something the rights of a human simply because it is Homo sapiens sapiens, then this would extend to tissue cultures and blood as well.

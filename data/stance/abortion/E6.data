To be honest, abortion is murder, as admitted by many scientists. However, the most common abortion is resulting from people being careless and stupid, not rape. Even in the case of rape, abortion should not be done. Even if the fetus is not alive, why terminate it? Who knows? What if the baby would have been born and developed in to a legendary scientist with an IQ of 200? My friend's mother was advised to abort her unborn child because it was very likely the baby would be born with a defect. She refused, and he was born without any defects and actually is a gifted learner in very advanced classes. So by your logic, if someone runs into your yard and plants an oak tree seed, you should take it out of the ground and dispose of it because it was a mistake? Ridiculous.......

Who cares what you call it??   Doctors. Scientists. You know, people who understand the developmental cycle of an embryo and realize that the different stages have different capabilities. An egg is not a chicken and a fetus is not a baby.    A baby/fetus/embryo is living inside the mother.   So is her liver, her heart, and her lungs. In quite a similar way, in fact; they are a part of her system and depend on it to live. If removed from her body, they will die.   Abortion terminates that life or the process of becoming a life.   The law should not protect a potential human life at the expense of an established one.   Ya know what else terminates life?   Stepping on a spider?    Murder.   Oh. I guess stepping on a spider is the same as both abortion and murder, since they all terminate life.

Life doesn't begin at conception. A pregnancy is a PROCESS of creating a life. This process begins with CONCEPTION. So conception is merely the beginning of a process.   Before the fetus can actually be kept alive outside of the mother's womb by society, then the mother alone must have the choice. Society should not take away her choice unless society can keep it alive without her.

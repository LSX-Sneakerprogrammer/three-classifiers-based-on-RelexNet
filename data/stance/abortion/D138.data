Ok, first let's get some terminology straight. Until the end of the eighth week after fertilization we have what's called an  embryo . An embryo is basically just a clump of cells with the potential to grow into a person. I think it's wrong to give it the same status as a fully developed human. I think abortion of an embryo should be legal, although, once it develops into a fetus it become more objectionable.   "You could get the procedure before even giving the idea much thought. It shouldn't be an option. It should be illegal."   You would have plenty of time to think about it. It's not like a woman can just touch her stomach and kill the baby. She would have to go the clinic, consult a physician, make an appointment, and then show up to the procedure. She could change her mind at any time.  And if this isn't enough time, it  still  isn't necessary to make abortion illegal -- we could simply enforce a waiting period of a week or so. This would avoid the sort of "impulse abortions" you seem to be worried about.

Because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society.   We have executions. We execute murderers. These are actually not kids but adults. So we do kill people and I fully support it.  .   Gassing six million Jews was wrong even if the Germans thought it was good   Well, arbitrarily exterminating a race of people goes against human survival.   .   If you were to see someone gunned downed I seriously don't think you are saying to yourself; Hey, we as a society need that person you therefore shouldn't do that. No I think not, your gut reaction is; Whoa! that's not right...what the...   You're absolutely right. But you fail to see that our  gut reaction  is our subconsciousness and in its own language, it's saying "hey, survival of the species is at stake here!"  .   Level of development   You're exceptionally thick, so I'm not hoping to get through to you at all. I'm simply hoping you'd one day wake up... How is a fetus not the same as person in the park? Well let's see... if the mother suffers a heavy fall or gets a bad virus, the fetus may well be naturally aborted and may no longer be, hell, sometimes it simply takes a little bit of stress felt by the mother for the fetus to be aborted naturally. A person in the park however, takes a hell of a lot more to end.  .   why are there still laws against murder? And why are there hospitals? Why did the President just pass a massive health care reform bill? if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about? If our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions? It can't be survival of the human species, were doing that quite well. So what then is it if it's not survival of the human species? Maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong, maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it.   Yes, human lives are valuable, but like I said, we're in no danger of extinction. All these measures such as laws against murder, hospitals, national health care, etc... are preliminary steps. Laws to mandate the saving of every possible human fetus would probably be the last thing to do... This may be necessary if something all of a sudden killed 90% of humans on Earth, for example.

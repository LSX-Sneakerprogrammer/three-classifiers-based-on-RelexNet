Why does a single cell "deserve" a chance to live? A single cell is insignificant. It will not suffer if it is destroyed. Life will go on without it. If I were killed as a cell I simply would not exist. No big deal. It would not have bothered me because "I" did not yet exist. A single cell has no consciousness and thus destroying it is no big deal.

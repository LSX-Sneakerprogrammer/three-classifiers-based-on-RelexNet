And that is wrong? Atheism is a religion. Listen when I debate I rarely if ever bring up religion, I don't have too. Science is clear about when human life starts.   Although I think you are unbelievable in what your post says here...again, I think at least you have the guts to spew what you feel and stand by it. The content is well...cold, inhumane, compassionless,empty....I could go on....  I believe in the saying keep your friends close, but your enemy even closer. I want people like you close.  I believe in free speech...so I am going to address and comment on the things you say here in the most honest way possible. Your views mirror Hitler and Margaret Sangers on life so it seems. Not totally, don't know if your a racist....but on the issue of abortion and many societal factors I think your pretty close. They thought killing certain segments of the population for the good of society was right. You feel the same way...only those you want to kill are in the womb. Do you also feel that people who are already born who are handicapped, mentally challenged, poor, those under a certain IQ should be eliminated? Maybe you do I don't know. Your worldview is simply one of the coldest I have seen.   Abortion prevents unwanted children.....Well first off there is no such thing as an unwanted child. There are people that adopt children every day.  Abortion increases happy family rates....Well if you think murder and killing make you happy then, that alone says a lot about a character of someone.   Abortion tears families apart. Abortion can affect a woman mentally for the rest of her life. It can cause shame, anquish and psychological trauma not only for her but for the father, children even grandparents if they know about the abortion. Most women who have had an abortion never tell anyone because of the stigma, because they know what they have done. If you think living with abortion is easy then you have another thing coming. We will never know statistically how many women suffer because most do not get help, most do not come forward and share.   Studies show that what I am saying is true. If you would like a list of many studies would be happy to fork them over.  Where are you getting the information that abortion increases the level of education? LOL Could you site that study would love to read it.  The fact is Guttmaucher says this...which does not make sense with what you are saying.  "Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 15-17 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 18-19 obtain 11%, and teens under age 15 obtain 0.4%."  " Women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 20â€“24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 25-29 obtain 24%."  Now this age group would be out of high school and college, most are not even in school.    "About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children."  This group is not going to school....most likely because they have multiple children at home. And if they are going for multiple abortion using it as birth control, they are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Abortion is not cheap and they obviously didn't learn by the first abortion.  " Forty-two percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level ($10,830 for a single woman with no children)."  Not the highest education group. You think by having an abortion these womens educational level will go up? LOL  Most abortion clinics are in poorer neightborhoods because it was set up that way. Sanger was a racist and she though blacks were inferior (Hitler admired her and agrees which history can attest to that)so she targeted them specifically. She talked at KKK meetings encouraging its members to target blacks. The Negro Project, Eugenic plan for Blacks....read them they will tell you all about her racism.    http://www.dianedew.com/sanger.htm   "The most merciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it."   Margaret Sanger, Women and the New Race   (Eugenics Publ. Co., 1920, 1923)   On blacks, immigrants and indigents:  "...human weeds,' 'reckless breeders,' 'spawning... human beings who never should have been born." Margaret Sanger, Pivot of Civilization, referring to immigrants and poor people"  On the purpose of birth control she said:  "The purpose in promoting birth control was "to create a race of thoroughbreds," she wrote in the Birth Control Review, Nov. 1921 (p. 2)"  On the rights of the handicapped and mentally ill, and racial minorities:  "More children from the fit, less from the unfit -- that is the chief aim of birth control." Birth Control Review, May 1919, p. 12  "The marriage bed is the most degenerating influence in the social order," Sanger said.  "Criminal' abortions arise from a perverted sex relationship under the stress of economic necessity, and their greatest frequency is among married women." The Woman Rebel - No Gods, No Masters, May 1914, Vol. 1, No. 3.  "I cannot refrain from saying that women must come to recognize there is some function of womanhood other than being a child-bearing machine." What Every Girl Should Know, by Margaret Sanger (Max Maisel, Publisher, 1915)   She was about forced abortion and mass sterilization for blacks. She was an inspiration to Hitler...and obviously her views still guide PP and others like you today.  Your thinking is dangerous to society. You presume to know what is good for society...and that good has all to do with killing. Both Hitler and Sanger believed what you are saying. Look where Hitlers worldview took him.....and the others he mass murdered.  I find what you say about men and abortion commical. I am certainly praying at this point you have no children and won't. I can only imagine how they would be raised.   You say the woman should have the say.....and then you want to be excused from parenting if its your sperm that impregnated the woman and you dont want the baby. Ahhhh you poor thing....not included.   Libertarian worldview.....all about themselves, nothing about anyone else...a cold cold unliveable philiosophy of life. Liberty for your kind is slavery, killing those they think are unworthy to live. Freedom of expression for you people is the gun....pointed at someones head. No absolutes....people just doing what they want to do even if it hurts society, even if it hurts their own family.   Your views are radical and your right you dont care about anything moral...that speak to your conscience and lack of one. For you rape could be good in some circumstances....and well we know your all for killing those that you dont think deserve to live. God only knows who is in that group.  Your worldview is not logical at all in fact I find it hidiously evil and dangerous. It strips away the preciousness of life and living. What a sad world you live in. Which is why those that value life....need to keep you close.

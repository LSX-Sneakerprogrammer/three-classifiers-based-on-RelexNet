Because it's wrong to destroy  innocent  human life regardless of intelligence. If you're saying it's perfectly fine to kill non-intelligent human life, then where is the cut off? Comatose patients? The mentally handicapped? I'm going to guess you'd cut the line just after the comatose (making euthanasia moral), but even then, it's  human life , which I believe is worth saving, not losing.

You haven't brought anything new to the debate at all... Still the "it's a person" argument. It's been rebutted many times. Many pro-choice people have agreed that in the third trimester abortions shouldn't be allowed unless it's absolutely necessary to save a life. If the fetus was going to experience a life of mainly vegetative state or the mother would certainly die, then I say save the mother cos she could at least have the chance to have another baby.

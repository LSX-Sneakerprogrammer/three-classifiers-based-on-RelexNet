As a woman who does not hold a religious stance on this but rather a personal experience stance, I think my argument holds a lot of water.   I had an abortion. I regret it deeply. I am older now and realize how selfish of a decision it was. I think because we can't see or hold or converse with the life, it is easy to dismiss but, I ALSO, almost did it again, 3 years later. I had two children already and had been basically tricked into a pregnancy I did not want. My boys were older, I had my life together and did not want another child. The issue was pushed by my partner and I was given an ultimatum. I got pregnant and he left 8 weeks into it. I was backed against a wall, scared, confused. How would I care for 3 children alone? I made an appointment and drove to Las Vegas ( hours and hours from where I lived. ) Once there I broke down in the parking lot and drove all the way home. I went through with the pregnancy and gave birth to a gorgeous little girl, met a guy that has been her dad for the last 5 years and I am reminded everytime I look at her, that the only thing that separated her from death was my unwillingness to walk up a flight of stairs. She almost wasn't here... so close. She also reminds me of the who isn't here because of a selfish decision I made. I like how so many people forget about adoption as an option...just like I did. Denying life a chance...

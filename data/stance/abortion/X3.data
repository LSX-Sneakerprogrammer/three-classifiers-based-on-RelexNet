But isn't it?   It's not. The popular positions are, but the clear answer is not.   Being for abortion in the case of rape or incest is completely inconsistent. Why would a pro-lifer be for killing an innocent baby in an incident of rape, whereas if the woman conceived a baby with her consent, she is absolutely forbidden to abort the baby because it's murder.   Because pro-life and pro-choice are idiotic. People can say they're pro-life because they don't know what else to say, but if they take a neutral stance they're better off then being rigidly pro-life.  I'll admit it's silly for them to call themselves pro-life when they are not, but they're still being smart to try and go for a middle man. It's not necessarily their fault culture requires that they pick a side.  Being neutral can be hard.   Why the double standard and inconsistency?   I'm not saying it's perfect. If you start with a flawed, rigid, one-sided position you're likely to not get much of anywhere. That's why I will never label myself pro-life or pro-choice, honestly. But that's also why these two extreme should at least have a middle man for middle-man opinions. Saying that we should pick pro-choice or pro-life, which this debate forces, is ridiculous. It encourages ignorance.

" I agree that unsafe sex is irresponsible, but people can be taught responsibility in other ways. We should handle this problem the same way we handle other acts of irresponsibility. Give the offender a fine, for example. Force them to attend safe sex classes. Maybe even have a prison sentence for repeat offenders. "  I kind of like that idea. It's creative and could be efficient. However, the main reason I have always disagreed with you is the because we have different answers for "When does life begin?" You believe a human fetus is human at some later point in pregnancy. I believe that it is human life at conception. And that's the main reason we disagree.

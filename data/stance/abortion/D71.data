I do not morally agree with getting an abortion, but there are good reasons sometimes for the practice. if a 13 yr old girl gets raped and gets pregnant then she should not have to risk her own life and have a kid she originally did not want. although i do not think people should go through life and have as many abortions as they want to just because they can. people should be sexually responsible and wear condoms/use birth control if they do not wish to have a child.

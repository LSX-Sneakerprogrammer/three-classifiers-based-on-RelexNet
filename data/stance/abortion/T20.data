god isn't real. the bible is just a fricking book written thousands of years ago to entertain a bunch of dimwits when they weren't out hunting and gathering or fighting in wars. it's just a series of letters written between a bunch of crackpot "saints" writing in code to try to fool the romans. so if your basing your opinion on abortion because you love to read the bible and follow god's word, your sadly mistaken... abortions are right up my alley. ROCK ON!!!!!

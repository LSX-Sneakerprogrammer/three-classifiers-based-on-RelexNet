This argument has already been covered, so I don't know why you're repeating it. But since you have, i will reply again:  Protective sex is the act of preventing life from happening in the first place. You're preventing fertilization from happening, some view this as on the same level as abortion so since abstinence or condoms are not outlawed, neither should abortion.  I get you're trying to make people realize the consequences of having unprotected sex, so what you should argue for is that UNPROTECTED SEX SHOULD BE BANNED, not abortion should be banned! Abortion is dealing with the aftermath, so let it be dealt with! If you want to PREVENT, then outlaw UNPROTECTED SEX. Make it illegal! Just like riding a bike without a helmet! It's illegal to ride bikes without helmets (at least in some countries).

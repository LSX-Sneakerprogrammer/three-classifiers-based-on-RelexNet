Sigh  yes all of your cum that gets wasted in your dirty sock is potential life. That doesn't matter though it has nothing to do with the issue at hand. What is being aborted is going to be a child, your cum can't be a child it's wasted. Killing the baby after a certain amount of weeks is painful to the baby. If a man kills a pregnant women he is charged with two accounts of murder. It seems that your "group of cells" becomes whatever you want it to be when it is most convinient. A born child effects a mother just as much as a baby. should all the mothers who think their children are to much of a burden be allowed to kill them? What if humans layed eggs and all children were born out of an egg. Would it still be okay to kill them? Your way of thinking would say no. It would no longer be okay because it isn't in her body. The issue doesn't seem to be whether it is a life form or not, but rather where it is and who it is effecting. Killing someone is wrong.  That baby is someone.  Abortion is wrong.

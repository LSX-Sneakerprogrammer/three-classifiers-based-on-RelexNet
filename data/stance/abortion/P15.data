The short answer is "yes", the long answer is "no". You are misconstruing the ideas of being a Homo sapien and being a person. An unborn fetus is not a human. That is like trying to say that an acorn is an oak tree. If one can claim such a thing, that is delusional.  It certainly is worthy of life. But that does not mean that abortion is morally wrong or it should not be legal. All you are doing here is throwing out pointless questions.

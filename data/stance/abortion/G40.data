If it is isn't murder, then why is that when a person murders a pregnant woman, whom is carrying a fetus, is charged with double homicide? How can that be? Where is the justice? Shouldn't it be only homicide? The person did in fact murder only one person because the fetus is not human   It's probably because a pregnant woman is seen as being more vulnerable, and motherly, so killing such a person is especially heinous.

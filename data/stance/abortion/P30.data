We waste resources all the time in this country - plastic surgery. It is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child (even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events, let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources)  Most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately, this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence, or if it is, it is very small. Saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people. A lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences. There are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations.   The father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body. You cant force people without violating their sovereignty (which i describe as the foundation of morality).   Moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value - this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions. Complex ethical generalizations (a theoretically codified moral state of mind [having explicit opinions]) is attained when people are older, but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue - this begins when consciousness is established. A person is not really a person untill they are conscious, otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings - the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness.   Consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious - once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc... This has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value (the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness).   Morality only applies to the parent when there is an abortion because the fetus is not yet a person - moral actions are between people and about the responsibility to actual people. Fetuses have not met the necessary requirement. This has to do with intrinsic vs extrinsic value - the fetus has no intrinsic value (no value from within).  The fathers rights are always categorically less than the mothers. he can express a claim but this claim can be superceeded by the mother.

You keep throwing around that word "unique" as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome. Bananas are asexually propagated, they bear no seeds, so they share the same genome for all members of a cultivar.   I think you have missed my basic point.  A human foetus is nothing like a fruit or a banana...so your comparisons are utterly absurd.

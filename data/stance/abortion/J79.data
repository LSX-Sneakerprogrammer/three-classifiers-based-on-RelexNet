They don't use, the only word I can think to describe them, tongs. They use a vacuum now.   A vacuum? oh that's alright then. Much less barbaric ;)   it's a burden   If having a child would be burden, then having sex is a terrible idea. Just sayin'. There is no way to be 100% sure that sex will not result in impregnation, so (assuming conceptuality), both parties should be prepared for all possible outcomes. Don't ya think?    usually a complete accident   Haha. It would take massive amounts of illicit drug use to be an accident ;) (I don't know that from personal experience so don't you be gettin' any ideas). Sex is intentional. In nature, it is meant to result in fertilization. It is not an "accident," it is what is supposed to happen.

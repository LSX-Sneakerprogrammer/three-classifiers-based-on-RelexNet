Ok, really?  You could have just kept this to yourself. I say these types of things in my head when I read some debates but, I don't post it.  Alright, let me put it this way. Once a human  "organism"  is made it is alive. Whither people like it or not it is fact that it is alive.  It moves, it eats, it grows, it thinks.  Are these not all the contributing factors of how our bodies are alive?

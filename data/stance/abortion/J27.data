I would be more than happy answering this question.  1. Rape is a violent crime, a violent act. The rapist should be caught and serve punishment. The woman is the victim for sure. And the child she might be carrying also is a victim. ESPECIALLY IF SHE THINKS TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT AND DECIDES TO KILL IT.   There is always adoption. In most communities there are Crisis Pregnancy Centers that help women in situations like this. Free medical care…etc.  2. What right do you have to presume you know how someone will life and what quality of life the person might have? You have no right. Oprah came from a household that was poor, she was also a victims of abuse. Look at her now. One of the most successful and rich women in the country, in the world.   There is no family…that does not suffer bad things. There are families with drug and alcohol users, families who are poor, divorced…no family skates through life with no trials. Support is an excuse…because there is adoption and there are services that help women who have no money.   How dare you imply that all mentally challenged people be aborted. Wow. Hitler had the same mentality and views as your imply here. My brother in law is mentally handicapped and he brings joy into our lives. ARe you perfect? Maybe you should have been aborted…????? ARE you good looking, a millionaire….problemless? I doubt it.   What you imply here is outrageous. If babies would be better off dead…because they will be in heaven…then lets kill all children…there would not be a population problem is we did this…we would go extinct.   Let me ask you this. Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?

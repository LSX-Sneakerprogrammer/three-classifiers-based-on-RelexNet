First off, finger and toe nails (along with hair) are not made up of cells. They're made up of a protein called keratin. Therefore, your toenail clippings do not have 46 chromosomes.      http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC334371/?page=1    Your fingernail clippings have all the DNA any other part of you has.     A fetus or an embryo of a human being has 46 chromosomes in each cell      With the exception of red blood cells... EVERY SINGLE LAST CELL IN THE HUMAN BODY has all the chromosomes in human DNA.

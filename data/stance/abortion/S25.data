Fuck No, how can you possibly think that it's the women's right to choose, the fetus is a living being that is growing and was created by God what right do you have to destroy what he has made good. You just should not have had sex in the first place why don't you be a little more responsible next time you go out and act like giant whore you stupid bitch. What the hell is your problem it's a human life, it's your own child for gods sake da hell. May god have mercy on your soul because I sure as hell wouldn't just consider your self lucky that there is a god that is more forgiving then I am.

"Atheism is [the inmate's] religion, and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being," the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said."  In this instance the inmate argued that atheism was a religion SOLELY for the purpose of being allowed to start his study group.   "The court decided the inmate's First Amendment rights were violated because the prison refused to allow him to create a study group for atheists"  "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."  "no law respecting an establishment of religion"  Establishment =something established; a constituted order or system.  Therefor, by actually forcing atheism to be considered a religion is in violation of the law because it institutes that a study group for religion is allowed more so then a separate kind of study group. Not to mention that atheism has always been a kink in the census system. Harder then you think to put atheism into that "other" category.   Religion=a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects.  Atheism is not a set of beliefs. Atheism is not a practice. Atheism Is not a religion.  Atheist=a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.  By your logic, believing in ghosts is a religion.   So by all accounts, this is a mistake by the Supreme Court that will undoubtedly be fixed in the foreseeable future. Also, the supreme court does not have the right to categorize any believe except in legal matters, so they can say that agnosticism is a religion but that REALLY isn't true.   Try again.

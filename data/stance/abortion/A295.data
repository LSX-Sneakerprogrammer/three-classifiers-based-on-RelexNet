Looking at the world in black and white is called moral clarity. Somethings are obviously wrong like theft, rape and murder. To say otherwise would be foolish and be to deny the obvious. Now you may use your intellect to justify those acts but then your intellect becomes complicit in the act. Not a place I want to go.   Of course no one wants to get an abortion   If that were true no one would get an abortion. People get abortions because they want to.  In regards to "feel something" and "the suffering that unwanted pregnancies causes" You seem to miss the greater suffering and depression women feel after an abortion, a suffering that last a life time. That suffering is far greater than that of finding out you got pregnant. That's the suffering I want to end. Not to mention the trauma of the child which just lead Nebraska to ban abortions after 20 weeks. It's called The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.   Because it is wrong to base the value of another human on subjective terms like those. Adopting subjective standards makes it possible for the strong to exploit the weak and that's exactly what your standard does. You ought to be protecting the weak and innocent, not using your intellect to come up with ways to justify their killing. For example you said  a viable fetus should be considered a full human being . So those that are not, are not human? You've just stripped them of their objective humanity by your subjective definition of humanity and now you feel justified in killing them, I'm sorry but that's not proper justification. I do hope you can see how dangerous your point of view is because it puts even your life in danger if logically followed through. All I have to do is be more powerful than you and determine that your life is not viable by my standards and then I'm free to kill you; might makes right.   That's why abortion should be banned, because all human life is valuable by the fact that it is human. If we move the value from the objective to the subjective than no one is safe and we have turned the law on it's head because laws are meant to protect people. But who is a person is subject to the opinion of another. I don't know about you but I never would want to be treated like that.

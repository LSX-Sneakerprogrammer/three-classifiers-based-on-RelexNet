Abortion isn't killing babies like most people think. A fetus in the early stages of development is really just a soup of cells lumped together in one spot. It doesn't have the ability to think or feel pain as it doesn't have a brain yet.   Sometimes abortion would be the best option for the mother. If a woman had been raped and got pregnant as a result of that, she has all the right to abort if she wants to. If a woman doesn't have the economic resources to support the child, abortion is also an option. Sure, some people say adoption but a lot of kids spend their whole lives in a shelter because nobody adopted them. Can you imagine how much mental pain they go through? How much they've suffered? If this situation is bound to happen, the best option would be to abort the unborn fetus before it has the capability of suffering.

Even the devil can quote scripture for his own purposes.  You do not have the original, therefore everything you have written could completely botched up. It's just like a long game of telephone.    You just precluded your ability to quote scripture for this debate.   I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    The point is that it isn't a choice that you make. You are able to process the decision now because you have a mind. A foetus has no mind. It isn't complete, it cannot think like you can.   Killing a foetus is like killing a doll, really? since when did the world become so insensitive to teach someone to refer to an act such as abortion, as killing... a.. doll.    It's basic biology. A developing brain is less sophisticated than an adult one, or child one. You take for granted this fact, that the brain develops in stages and each stage has limitations before the progression to the next. An infant cannot understand abstract concepts. A child cannot understand sexuality. A foetus is not aware like we could consider it. It isn't a child agonising over death.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.    If you have nothing well-thought-out to say, then do not speak. This is a debate and thoughtless statements are not appreciated.  Also, learn your place. You have no possession of the female gender. Theirs is not your body to command over and their life is not yours to play fate with.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it. yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her, you be the one to watch it as it dies, if it isnt alive then why bother?   A child needs love, attention, and it needs to be wanted. Children who are neglected and abused may become criminals. They become broken so they resort to crime and display emotional problems.  Family planning allows us to prevent unwanted children from entering the world.  I feel nothing towards foetal death. It isn't a baby. A baby's death is lamentable because of wasted innocence. A foetus dying has no bitterness because it isn't a person, but a thing which may only be doted upon by those who are not educated enough to know better.   We can only see thing's as human if they breathe talk and walk? Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable. I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.   What defines humanity is a philosophical question which I assure you has few absolute answers. Biology suggests that we form in stages, with our minds truly mature in women at her late teenage years, in men at his early twenties. This suggests that you are not fully human until that point, for you are still growing into adulthood. A simpler definition would be that what defines humanity is our identity. We form an identity as we gather memories in this world and reflect upon them to grow. In either definition, a foetus isn't fully human because it is still growing and unable to have identity.

Lots of parts in the Bible are literal but there are that have a different meaning then what stands out. Jesus said a lot of parables that contained a specific meaning. A lot of science is correct except evolution, the big bang, etc... Your are not a Christian at least for now so your understanding of the Bible is not as great as mine.

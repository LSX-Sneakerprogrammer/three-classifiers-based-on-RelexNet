Since you haven't disputed my other arguments on the other end, I shall simply respond to this one.   Which ones?   Which says absolutely nothing about abortion is morally right or wrong.   Why should someone be killed for anther person's mistake?   Thus, your idea of whether sex is intentional or not would depend on whose perspective you are taking.   From either perspective (with the exception of rape). Thus, people should be held responsible for their actions. In this case, that means raising a child.  The entire purpose of sex is for fertilization to occur. It isn't an "accident" at all. It is deliberate and intentional.    An earthquake could be natural.   An Earthquake isn't the fault of the people liven near it. That is a terrible analogy. They are not bringing an earthquake upon themselves as they are with sex.

Then you are psychotic.   (Laughs)   The United States.   I care not about the laws of the United States, I am not american (thankfully) thus subjective parochial american laws mean nothing to me and have no bearing on the comparative ethics of abortion.   Apples are multicellular. They are communities of plant cells. They are living organisms.   Such ignorance...do apples breed?  Do they feed?  Do they excrete?  Do they react to stimuli?  Get a science education before you post.   I have as much emotion for a foetus dying as an apple or plum being consumed. They are on the same level of self-awareness (or lack thereof).   You are psychotic...and I feel the same way about anyone who harms the defenceless... ;)

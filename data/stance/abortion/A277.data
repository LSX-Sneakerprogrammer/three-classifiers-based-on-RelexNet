Don't compare people to the Nazis.  Nazis think they're superior to other races when in fact they are not.  The fetus is not a person. And don't say it is because this has been argued too many times.  I'm tired of see this argument: "Abortion would have killed YOU!" No it wouldn't. It wasn't me because it was a fetus. My mother would have killed a fetus, not me! My mother had an abortion before me, but I'm here now so how do you know if it wasn't me that she aborted initially? Are we going to take this debate into the realms of fantasies and reincarnations?

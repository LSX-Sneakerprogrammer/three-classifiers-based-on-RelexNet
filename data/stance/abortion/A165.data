Well I'm sorry (not literally) that you feel so categorical towards the development of human life. Some of us, who actually believe in a reproduction with effort, look at a fetus AS HUMAN LIFE. While it may be a scrambled cluster of cells, it is already developing beyond the category of "potential," regardless of self-awareness. Any scientist will tell you what reproduction means the world to the human race.  Maybe it's a parasite to you, but it's something completely different in the end isn't it?  Look, I don't care about all this BS with "what is a child and what isn't," it isn't even the point of my argument.  My point is that a child cannot voice an opinion, and that sometimes, to prevent the worst, someone has to voice it for them. If we were all like you, saying that it should be completely up to the mother, then there'll be no need to second guess how the population will be affected.  For all you know, you could be aborting the next 'potential' President, or the next 'potential' anything! No-one can say how that'll change things, after all, the only means of comparison has just been scraped out of a woman's womb.  So Mr. Potential, have a nice day, and have a hard, long think about the 'potential life' that isn't even given the chance to survive!

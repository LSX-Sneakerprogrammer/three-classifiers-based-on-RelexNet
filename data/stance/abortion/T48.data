"Murder is an act which is committed upon persons. A fetus is not a person. Have you ever accidentally cut off a sliver of your skin? You've just killed more cells in that act than the typical abortion."   This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being. Therefore, to terminate this human life is murder.   "However, you are self aware of this journey. A fetus isn't even aware that it is alive. It is a mass of cells with minimal brain tissue if any exists at all."   This is rather dangerous thinking. Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity. I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia, possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.   "Life for us legally begins at birth. Practically speaking it begins when we are first self-aware, which is well beyond the mere fetus stage."   What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.   You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.   "Taking your argument to extremes, every skin cell is a potential life, ready for propagation through activation of totipotentcy and cloning, or enucleation of a host zygote, insertion of your purified DNA and implantation into a host uterus. Every time you shed dander you are a mass murderer, congratulations."   The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference.    "It's a womans' rights issue because to be a part of a free society means having ownership and jurisprudence over your own body."   Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.      "you are overstepping your boundaries and effectively hijacking her reproductive organs for your own moral agenda."   And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.   "Maybe you would have empathy for women on this topic if political activists were campaigning to take control of your ejaculations, arguing that a single sperm is a life"   When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).

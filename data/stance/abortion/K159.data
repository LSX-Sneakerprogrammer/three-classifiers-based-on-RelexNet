So just because it hasnt fully developed, it isnt worthy to live? You had to develop, so you would have been happy if your mum had been like "Fuck This, Its not even fully developed DIE BABY DIE!"??     I believe I said that an undeveloped human isn't worthy of the rights bestowed upon developed humans.  Do you even know what this debate is about? Have you seen images of what is aborted in 90% of cases?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ File:Baby-06.jpg     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ File:6_weeks_pregnant.png     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ File:10_weeks_pregnant.png    It's not a baby, not even close.

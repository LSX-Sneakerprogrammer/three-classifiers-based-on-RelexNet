What about an ectopic pregnancy? It happens when an egg is fertilised whilst still in a fallopian tube, and if left unaborted, will rupture the woman's internal organs, and kill the mother and the child. Surely, even if you take the (rather outdated) stance that abortion is equivalent to killing a baby, it is better to abort the foetus and save the mother than allow both baby and parent to die.

This gets murky, because each person differs in DNA. Then at what point does something stop being animal and start being human? We currently investigate how animals reason and communicate in order to determine their degree of 'humanness' for want of a better word. By your definition, we should give a chimp 98.6% of human rights. Why shouldn't we judge a person's worth by their skills and aptitude, indeed, that is how modern society judges a person's value, their salary and place in society is largely determined by how well they predict and manage obstacles. And to an extent, we do shun those who are incapable. That is how our Laissez Fair paradigm works.

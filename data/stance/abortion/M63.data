First off, finger and toe nails (along with hair) are not made up of cells. They're made up of a protein called keratin. Therefore, your toenail clippings do not have 46 chromosomes. But that's not my point. My point is that although parts of your body, like dead skin cells, have 46 chromosomes, they are merely small parts of a large organism. A fetus or an embryo of a human being has 46 chromosomes in each cell and each cell helps to be part of a body! An entire body!

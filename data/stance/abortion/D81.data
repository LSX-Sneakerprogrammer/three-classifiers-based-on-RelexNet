It is allowed to kill to save your own life.. it should therefore be okay to kill a fetus if this saves the life of it's mother..   But I dont think it should be allowed to kill unwanted fetuses, those can be given to adoption..  its hard to tell if it's the child of a rapist though, I don't think I would want to give birth to the child of my tormentor if I were a woman..

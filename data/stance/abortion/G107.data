In a debate either you are for or against. Ask anyone that and they will tell you. Are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion. If i recalled my opposing team was pro choice. Why? Because they are against abortion. You seem to be lacking common sense. Really? As far as i am concerned whatever a person say portrays the idea of that person as in reading a book and trying to figure out the idea or goal of the writer. Again you don't care. That to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge. Your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence. Please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you, you are a person of science. You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts. Please, you are a person of science one day you will stand against an opposing team face to face and then you will understand what i am talking about. When you say that i am retarded lets say that a woman who intentionally has unprotected sex aware of the consequences but now goes to the extent of killing the fetus, are you implying that there is no innocence or good in that fetus? Are you saying that there is nothing wrong with that? To me that is just selfishness. Well in order to debate a topic you need to know the origin of that case and then identify the weakness in that origin. If it was a speech called informative speech and lets say you were referring to reasons why abortion should be made illegal then the origin would have been completely different as my professor advised me last week. Well Actually you do not need to say who is worst or not because i have friends in pre law on here and have already taken a look at this debates and has already given me a response.  Why are you running from the truth? Point out to one statement which you made that had an authoritative reference? Exactly. When you think you know everything or do not want to know then your perception might be wrong. Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy. Believe me and my team comprises of at least 25 members who are excellent at debating. I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.  You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance. You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey. Maybe you are better off in science. When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.  And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.  There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute. Check up on your book again my friend. And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense. You need people to explain everything to you. And furthermore, this is not a debate this is selfishness.

oh and further more, all my arguments i had proof for aveske and if his arguments were indeed intelligent, then how come i had evidence to support my claim and i brought up every important point that he avoided?  And i am never unprepared because i am a student in criminal law again. These debates are nothing new for me. One thing i hate on here though is people give all sorts of opinions without evidence and expect them to be true.

im sorry but i would much rather have my baby in heaven then on earth if i couldn't take care of it. i don't understand why we feel that we get to dictate what other people can do with their bodies. different people have different morals and we can't tell them what to think or feel. it's not right to tell people what to think or feel then they aren't who they are anymore.

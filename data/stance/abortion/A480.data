I think it should remain as a choice for the mother. What if the child is the result of a rape? What if the mother's life is in danger? What if the child is to be born with a life-threatening illness? I think the quality of life should be taken in to consideration and not necessarily the quantity. If the child was going to live perhaps twenty/thirty years with a debilitating disease is it fair to allow him or her to suffer with no prospect of ever being fully healthy?

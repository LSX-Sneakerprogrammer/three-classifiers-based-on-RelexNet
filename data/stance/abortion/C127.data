Presently actually means "soon". Thus the sentences are practically the same.    Presently in my recollection of English means at the current moment. However, even if we borrow your meaning to read  "It doesn't matter what it could become. It only matters what it will be soon."  It follows from context that I don't care for the near-future but the more distant future, since that is when birth happens.

I repeat for the benefit of the poster of this link.  PLANTS DO NOT POSSESS CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS.  You seem to have some difficulty accepting this simple premise...so please shove your link up your unscientific behind.   So you know better than experts in biology who study plants for their career.  How arrogant.  You might notice that I'm not wasting time typing long replies. This is because you are too emotional to argue anything of substance. You are too easy to dispute.

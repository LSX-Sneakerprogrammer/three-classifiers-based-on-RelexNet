I think there is an underlying definition inadequacy here. What pro-abortionists deem lives seems incompatible with what anti-abortionists believe in. I myself do not believe that life begins at conception, but rather at birth. That is why I cannot cede to the 'thousands of deaths'. I do not define them as deaths, but rather as a treatment for what essentially is a parasite, until birth. And just because you call this treatment by emotionally evocative names dosent make it any less right. See blamo in regards to your comment about science.

Any creature with a nervous system has "feelings", what I am referring to are thoughts and emotions.   Are you saying that a new born does not have thoughts and/or emotions?   It is both, humans maybe parasites for the first nine months of their existence, but they are still human.   I did not say that the fetus is not a Homo sapien. No fair minded person will accuse me of saying such a thing.   Thus killing a human being.   So? You have not shown that this is morally wrong in any way.   You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human, but rather parasites. Unborn babies still fit the definition of "parasite" regardless of what trimester they're in. Do you contend that the unborn baby can be both a parasite and a person at the same time?   I said that fetuses are parasites. But I did  not  say that they are not Homo sapien. Get your facts right. For example, a tick can both be considered an arthropod and a parasite.  In any case, you still haven't shown that abortion is morally wrong.

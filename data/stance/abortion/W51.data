How can we differ ourselves from murderer if we ourselves are cold-hearted enough to kill an innocent child...one who has not even get the chance to see the world? Mothers should have the love for children...and when you had a child whether born or not, it is your responsibility to raise them up, to guide them to their future. These should be the characteristic of a mom...to raise the kids up and not to give up on them.

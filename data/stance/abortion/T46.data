Yea, christians aren't perfect. But is anybody else? If you were responsible you would have done the right thing in the first place, but obviously if you are in the abortion state, you weren't responsible. If you aren't prepared for what might happen due to your own actions, then don't do it. If you don't risk mistakes then you wouldn't be put into the situation.

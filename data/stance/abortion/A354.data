So the woman's decision means killing a child, and that should be ok?  How is the fact that the child was conceived through rape, the childs fault? Would you treat this child different after it was born? So, why treat it any different before?  Finally, abortion is NOT the only way to escape raising a child that would remind that person of something horrible. They can put the child up for adoption. There are thousands of families waiting.

Then why are you even debating a topic that you fail to research on?   I did research it.   Legal rulings has nothing to do with politics. If that was the case then why is political science different from law.   Law IS a form of politics. It's about appeasing many different voices on an issue by creating legislation that they can all agree on.   Laws are formed out of the decisions made by politicians i agree but at the same time amendments to the laws are also made by the supreme court as well. Whether you are dealing with science or business etc at some point you will have to abide by the instructions of the laws.   Which at some point are influenced by those with a voice in the matter.

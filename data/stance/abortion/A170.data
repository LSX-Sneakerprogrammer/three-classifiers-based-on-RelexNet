You demand logic? Try demanding some sense out of yourself!  Did you actually read the whole thing? My whole argument? Or did you just skip a few lines along the way through???  My point overall was that this debate is biased and complex, and that no sound amount of "logic" is going to convince anyone.  This topic demands what a person "thinks" and "feels," not how he pulls out a statistic or two and calls a problem an "effect." The correct answer is that an abortion is both, and yet you fail to see how I have clearly solved the problem for both sides.   Rape is illegal, and yet it still happens.  Think about that.  If you actually "pieced" my arguments together, you would actually notice that I am actually not calling for an immediate ban on abortions. With the right plan, an abortion will no longer be necessary, and will be naught but bad memories.  I give you educational examples and you deny them without giving them a second thought. Wow, that shows a lot of character. Clearly you are the most biased debater on this site.   "If you continue to argue with a belligerent disregard for logic, I will have no choice but to think you an unworthy debater and disengage."   Wow, you've shattered me, that makes me reconsider everything, knowing that in your vision I am some f#cking pro-creationist who only gives a damn about his own f#cking opinion! You know what? I'm done with this BS, I shouldn't have bothered replying to you. You clearly show little respect towards me based on my beliefs. Do I make you sick? Good, I hope it lasts for a long time.  You know something, if it wasn't for your 4th paragraph, I would have thought that you could never learn.  Regardless, you clearly are too biased to see my point, and that is why I am done trying to convince you. I'll do my usual and just present more speeches and win more awards, after all, people in the real world actually think my ideas are worthwhile.

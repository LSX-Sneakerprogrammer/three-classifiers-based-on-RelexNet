A baby can't survival outside of someone's care for long. Generalizing your argument, killing anything and any one isn't murder since in some way they are dependent on others and are nothing but a collection of cells.   Should abortion be limited to only being allowed before the 24th week, if not then what is the relevancy of it to your argument? If so or if not, what is it about being inside of a person's body that makes it so different from being dependent on it?   Why do both sides of the abortion debate have terrible arguments?

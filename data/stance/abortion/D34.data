It should be legal because it is an action on someone's body and that person has a right to do what they want with their body. Obviously the person should make an educated decision if to get an abortion or not(adoption is a viable option)but in the end it is their choice.  If the person considering abortion lives in poverty(or other adverse conditions) and does not feel or know that she can properly care for the baby once it is born and give it the foundation of a good and healthy life then an abortion should be legal so as that the suffering that the child would endure could be prevented.   Making abortion illegal denies one's freedom over one's body and no institution should be able to make such a claim or action.

What amazes me is that iamdavidh has the patience to put forth logics to argue against your stupid feelings and belief system. The question is never whether the fetus is a human! We all know it's human! It's a human sperm and egg so ofcourse it's human.   The question really is "is it a person?"... and it's clearly not. Leave your beliefs and bible at home please.

A human life is not something to ditch.   That's why we advocate abortion. There are enough orphans in the world who will never have a whole, loving family.   Show me where in the bible that god forgives deliberate, planned murder.   Did you read another post I made on this debate?   Hosea 13:15-16  “I will have no compassion,  even though he thrives among his brothers.  An east wind from the Lord will come,  blowing in from the desert;  his spring will fail  and his well dry up.  His storehouse will be plundered  of all its treasures.  The people of Samaria must bear their guilt,  because they have rebelled against their God.  They will fall by the sword;  their little ones will be dashed to the ground,  their pregnant women ripped open.”  1 Samuel 15:1-3  Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord. This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’”  Deuteronomy 21:18-21  If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.” Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.    If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation.   They are not children. Words have a distinct meaning. Children are born, and have minds of their own. A foetus has no mind. It is incomplete, unaware. I think that you need to come to terms with your nature, that like all life we are mechanisms which are built in stages. A foetus is a stage of human without a mind, or awareness of itself. Killing it is like killing a doll.   If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world.   That's what orphans are for.   When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.   A foetus isn't a child. A foetus cannot be murdered. You need to learn your place, let women make their own decisions without sticking your nose into it.

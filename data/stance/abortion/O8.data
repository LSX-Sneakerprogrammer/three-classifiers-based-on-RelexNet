Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg. Therefore, when a woman's get pregnant, it is the woman's fault only.   You know that sperm doesn't ask permission before it fertilizes an egg, right?   Why not say, "The man allowed his sperm to fertilize her egg?" and blame the man?  Why not blame them both equally for engaging in consensual sex?  Or why not blame anybody, because that doesn't help anything? Accidental pregnancies can happen to anybody, no matter how careful they are. To think a woman must carry out a pregnancy just because she dared to have sex is vindictive. Pregnancy should not be used as a form of punishment.

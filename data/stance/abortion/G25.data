How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus? You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well. If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence. And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.

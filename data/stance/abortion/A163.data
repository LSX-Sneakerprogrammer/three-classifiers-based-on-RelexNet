Ok.  You're now officially making ludicrous points. Congrats.  Gargantuous isn't even close to the word which is used to describe the difference between a sperm cell and an unborn fetus: A sperm cell has not yet entered the fertilisation process; a fetus has.  You said it yourself: There are thousands of sperm. There are also many eggs in a female. If you masterbate, it isn't the end of the sperm world! There are still going to be thousands upon thousands more and ready to be concieved! So please do not BS this debate and say that sperm = fetus, because it is completely wrong.  Lose a sperm cell, no big deal; lose a fetus, there is something to be concerned with.  No need to over-explain, your whole argument was wrong anyway.

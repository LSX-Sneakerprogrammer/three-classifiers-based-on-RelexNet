You've not mentioned a single stat or study, just your self-righteous bullshit. There's nothing wrong with abortion before the third-trimester because it's no more alive than mold or an amoeba. And it's also none of your business. More people die of starvation or war than these clusters of cells from abortion anyway. Why don't you and your psychotic ilk try doing something about that instead of crusading against teenage mothers and rape victims. It seems a bit cowardly that with all that is wrong in the world you can only pick on little girls.

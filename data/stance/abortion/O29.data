Is it not wrong for a person to decide if another's life is worth while? I would of reckoned that is for each individual to decide.   If someone is using your body as a life support machine, don't you think you should have the right to decide if they continue to do so? Even if that person is your own offspring, even if that person is a completely self-aware adult, your body should not be used for anything against your ongoing permission. If physical autonomy is less important than another human's life, then the door is opened for things like government mandated organ donation.

It is true that women who choose to engage in sex should think about their future before they do it, yet it is their body and freedom do with it as they please, and they have the responsible of making a decision, so if they choose sex, then at least, choose safe sex; otherwise, abortion is the real only option because society then will be paying through welfare. What is cheaper? Welfare or Abortion...?

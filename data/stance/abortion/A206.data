Listen, you want to believe it's a living thing based on that video, fine, I'll trust science. If science says it's a sentient being, I'll be against it.  In the meantime, don't make these poor girls feel worse they they already do about the whole thing.  So you're against it, but obviously a lot of people think that "silent scream" is rubbish.  You know what, beatles make a noise when you squish them. They're not sentient though, and they actually have more brains than a fetus before the first couple weeks.  Meanwhile, these poor girls, half the time they were raped, or their still just kids them self,  and you get these nuts calling them nazis and killers and everything else,  you know what, they're not killers. I don't know what a fetus is, you don't, but science does, and science says they aren't people yet.  It says they're people after the third-trimester,  before then, leave these girls alone until you have some scientific proof beyond,  "I really really really really  feel  it's a living person."  And to the last ridiculous paragraph. Had I been aborted I would have never existed, and so no, I would not have been killed. So there. I was a sperm once too, should guys stop ejaculating?

Being alive is the most valuable and precious thing on earth, and I don't see why people take death lightly. Anyone could walk out of their house one day and get killed by a bus, or any vehicle. Life is too short. If a person decides to have sex unprotected, they should be able to make this choice with the consequences in mind. Everybody who has sex is old enough to know the consequences and with sex education being compulsory on the national curriculum there really is no excuse. The NHS will give out free contraception so there is no way that you can say it isn't available in this country. If you value life, then you would never have an abortion, abortions in my opinion are given out too freely and are an easy way out for someone who was so stupid enough not to take contraception. During childbirth, so many drugs and forms of giving births are available so there is no excuse why (except medical conditions) that a woman wouldn't be able to give birth.

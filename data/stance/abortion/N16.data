I never disputed this. I asked if, on your view, the retarded, senile, and comatose are all in the same boat as fetuses as none of them are self-aware and some are not feeling.   Not even close. The retarded are sentient. Comatose may wake up, senile are sentient. You refuse to accept a fetus is equal to what I've compared it to accurately. Instead making incorrect comparisons to support a misguided view.   It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body, but it in no way is a part of her body. In the same way a splinter is in my body but not a part of my body. The fetus is not an organ of the mother.   In that sense. And in that sense aborting it is morally equivalent to removing a splinter as well.   It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder.   No it isn't, because it is not sentient.   I haven't once made a religious statement here. I've only given statements from biology.   No, you've given statements from the religious (specifically christian) mis-representations of biology and propaganda campaign. These ideas are only found on religious sites.   Cool red herring and ad hominem.   It's neither. It's an observation of a trend, one which this debate highlights perfectly.   Only if you actually answer the one question I've asked and stick with biology instead of emotion.   I've answered all of your questions then some. When I make a valid point you reply (as I notice christians do often in debates about abortion ) by claiming I've not answered some question. You're not the first to do this.   You really enjoy ruddy fish.  So can I get an answer to my question up top now?   I've answered all of your questions then some. When I make a valid point you reply (as I notice christians do often in debates about abortion ) by claiming I've not answered some question. You're not the first to do this.

1. Just as my fingernails and hair do not make up the whole of a human, so too a fetus does not make up the whole of a human. They do have equal feelings, emotions and understanding on the matter though.  3. It is in every way part of the mother. It is a cluster of cells with no feelings, emotion of ability to be self-aware growing within her. And wether it is alive is not the point at all. It is not even close to the point. The point is whether it is self-aware and capable of feeling, which it definitely, without any doubt, is not.  4. No, you're imagining a human where there is none. I'm giving you fact you're giving me your personal misguided feelings.  5. My claim is not based on genetic code or whether it's living. It's based on being self-aware. Gentetic code and living have nothing to do with the matter as I clearly showed in the examples of hair, nails, insects and moss.  I'll make you a deal, when you have the omniscient ability to know exactly what every female and fetus on earth is thinking and feeling and you can prove to me you have this ability, then if fetuses stop dying of natural causes all on their own magically, I'll agree with your self-righteous nosy bullshit.

//Abortion should not be legal for the simple reason that the baby that they are killing, is a person//  This argument is void because: 1) Abortion kills a process only; 2) A baby is the end result after the process has been completed; and 3) Personhood is a status that one is given upon birth (example: it's a birth certificate not a conception or fertilised egg certificate.)  //how would you feel if you were aborted//  If I were aborted, I had no consciousness to form a thought. To truthfully answer your question, I wouldn't care.  //...and dont say fetuses dont have feelings//  Ok, I won't, but let's see what the experts say:  "there is increasing evidence that the fetus never experiences a state of true wakefulness in utero and is kept, by the presence of its chemical environment, in a continuous sleep-like unconsciousness or sedation. This state can suppress higher cortical activation in the presence of intrusive external stimuli."  http://www.rcog.org.uk/ fetal-awareness-review-research-and- recommendations-practice

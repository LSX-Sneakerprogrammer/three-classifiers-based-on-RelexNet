So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people?   The short answer is "yes", but the long answer would have to be "no".   What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.   No, they don't. According to the OED, autonomy is defined as "a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws, and not subject to any higher one. b. Organic independence." A baby that is born do have autonomy.  Self-consciousness is defined, according to the OED, as "Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc." As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing, he/she is said to possess self-consciousness. A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness.   2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.   It between "a rock and a hard place" is not the same as moral neutrality. Furthermore, morally permissible is not morally neutral. You are contradicting yourself here.   3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.   Yes, it seems like I have misread your statement. I apologise for that. And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality.   4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.   However, you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible.   5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.   First, the fetus is neither a "child" nor a "baby". Thus, your entire argument is moot. Second, while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else, you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother. As I have said, since the fetus is not a person, it would be fallacious to accrue the same rights to a fetus as you would any other person.

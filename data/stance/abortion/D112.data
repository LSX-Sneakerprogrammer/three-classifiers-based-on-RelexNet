Actually, about 50%+ of all women who have had abortions end up regretting it later in their lives. So, now we're killing for the greater good? "Yes, because this baby might make our lives slightly more stressful, lets kill it, even though it had no choice as to become a fetus, it was me who was having sex." Is the attitude we should have? Plus, what if you're NOT killing for the greater good? What if that child had grown up to be the next greatest president? Or a great scientist?

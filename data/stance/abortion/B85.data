What is the difference between a viable fetus (and many so called viable babies die after being born after 24 weeks) at 24 weeks and a fetus at 23 weeks? Do you know for a fact that one at 23 weeks would not survive? My neice was born at 23 weeks. Most pro-aborts here would say it is fine to kill them at that gestational age.   And tell me atypican....what gives anyone the right to kill a human being at any gestational age?  Do you know much about fetal development? Take a look at this website...if you click on the date it will show you an actual 3-D picture.   http://www.babycenter.com/ fetal-development-week-by-week    This one is 16 months....   http://www.babycenter.com/ fetal-development-images-16-weeks    Baby can show facial expressions and can hold head erect. The baby pumping over 25 quarts a day. Unbelievable. All this is happening well within the legal time a woman can abort. Tell me why this is not human.............    http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/ video?p=fetus+at+16+weeks

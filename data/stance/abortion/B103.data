Nobody has the right to another person's body. A woman has the right, for lack of a better term, evict. It is her body, she does not have to gestate for 9 months if she doesn't want to. Arguments about having sex mean you accept pregnancy are ludicrous.  Look at it this way. We don't require parents to give up their organs, or their blood, or their extra kidney, or even their bone marrow in order to save the life of their 1 year old child. If that child needed a transplant or it dies, we do not force the parents to donate. even something like Bone marrow, that will not kill them. We don't force anyone to undergo a medical procedure they don't want to.  So why would we force a woman to keep the fetus alive. It uses her kidneys, blood, lungs, etc. Pregnancy can cause health problems and complications worse than being a bone marrow donor, or even a kidney donor. Why would the law force a woman to go through pregnancy until the fetus is born, but not require the parents to keep the born child alive? Why does the fetus get special protection that a child does not?   The woman needs to choose to gestate for 9 months, and accept the risks that go with it at every stage. She has the right to change her mind if the risks become to great, or even her awareness of the risks become too great. When she becomes pregnant, she should have the right to research and evaluate the risks of carrying to term consult with her doctor and accept or reject those risks.

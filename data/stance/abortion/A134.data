I think that abortion is absolutely wrong in all ways because it's killing a innocent life. For all you know, that baby could've been the one to make a cure for cancer or AIDS. I think that in a situation such as being raped, that the baby is innocent and the baby had nothing to do with whoever raped you, it's not the baby fault. There are all kinds of options in the world like adoption that you could choose if you don't want your baby. Unplanned pregnancy is no reason to have an abortion because I feel like if you had sex willingly then you knew what the possible outcome could be. I AM 100% AGAINST ABORTION FOR ANY REASON. NO BABY DESERVES THAT!

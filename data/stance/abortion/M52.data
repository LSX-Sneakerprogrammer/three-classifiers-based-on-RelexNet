Should not the philosophy behind laws and Laws themselves be consistent? If abortion is justified by the lack of sapience. Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies, killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth, even during a temporary period like sleep?   Dumpster babies have a level of self-awareness, as noted by their ability to respond to stimuli, that they have a nervous system, and that they have a memory. Sleeping babies are the same.  I personally approve of euthanasia for the severely mentally handicapped, and people who are in comas long enough that their recovery is nonexistent. Provided that the mentally handicapped are violent, and/or completely unable to function.  But this is all besides the point: laws are never consistent in their philosophy.   which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience   We don't base laws on the potential future ramifications of a choice. This is why disposing of a used condom isn't considered abortion, for example.   The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience. If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems. Sapience is not always active, consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything?   This is because sapience comes from the brain. If a foetus has none, it cannot be sapient. Sapience in this discussion is an umbrella word for independent thought, some level of consciousness, an ability to make decisions and so on.  We don't apply it to organisms with developed brains because those organisms are already capable of individuality. At this point, losing consciousness doesn't disqualify the individuality, unless the organism has transitioned into a state where they can not recover their consciousness, such as in a coma.   If someone came to me and needed one of my organs. I would not be the cause of them needing my organ. I would not be liable for their situation. A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation. She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it.   This is why abortion is made available. In those cases where a woman becomes pregnant, she can abort before the foetus is even a person, before it has a brain. By illegalising abortion, you remove a woman's right to abort the process that creates a human life, you force her to either have an illegal abortion, or to accept that pregnancy automatically leads to a human being born.   In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us, not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.   The laws allowing abortion do so because it suits the women. They don't parade themselves as some sort of philosophical and moral beacon. It's mostly pragmatic.

i think it depends on the circumstances. if you were raped, and then got pregnant, would you still keep the child. Certainly it shouldn't be a form of birth control, but in some cases it should be allowed. besides if your argument is that we would be taking a life then wouldn't we have to stop anything that takes a life such as war, the death penalty, and meat production?

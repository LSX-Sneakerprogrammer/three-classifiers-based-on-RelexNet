I am 20, polyamorous and a virgin. Our society is not sex crazed.   It is at a minimum 16 or 18 years to raise a kid(possibly less), at most a life time.   A teen mother is dependent on her own mother. she is in no economic situation to even raise herself. She is burdening her network of support, but given proper support can indeed get a education and a wonderful life.   my dad is more of a provider then a father. At times it seems like he might as well not even be there. Good friends of mine have grown up in motherless houses, split between parents and in fatherless houses. A nuclear family is not proven to be best. All my friends are quite well as am myself. Many of my friends came from backgrounds which should of lead them into being crack-fiends according to you; they are not.   It should also be noted a teenage mother is only a teenager for so long. One of my best friends girl-friends was a teenage mom(and now just a mom), another one of my best friends ex-girlfriends became pregnant by another man shortly after they broke up and is either 16 or 17. I have seen these women and their situation and i fully believe that they still possess every opportunity in the world if not more then they would have not being a mother. Neither of them have rich parents by the way. they are actually on the lower end of the economic spectrum.

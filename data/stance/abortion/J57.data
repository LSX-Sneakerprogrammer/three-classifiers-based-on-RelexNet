Go back to my previous post and find the part where I said something to the effect of the following: "No woman has ever experienced any negative emotions after getting an abortion."  If you can do that, your response won't have been mostly a waste of time.    How do you know what women feel after abortions? You have no clue whatsoever and neither do the professionals.   You wouldn't have to ask this if you read the source I provided. How did researchers reach the conclusion that most women feel relieved after an abortion? They asked them. They administered surveys to women who underwent abortions and asked them to explain how they felt about the process. 76% said they felt relieved. The data doesn't agree with your stance, learn to deal with it.    http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/ Phil%207570%20Website/aAdler1990.pdf     I talk here from experience, one who knows who has gone through this.   You know people who have regretted abortions, so it's impossible that most abortion patients are okay with their procedure? This is blatantly biased. Your subject group is heavily skewed: women who are happy with their abortions obviously won't come looking for abortion healing so they're not nearly as visible to you. It's fallacious to assume your experience is representative of everyone's.   For the women who do feel guilt or depression: how much of that is owed to the prevalence of the idea that they  should  feel terrible for getting abortions? If family and/or society is unsupportive or hostile to women who choose abortion, or if they're even perceived that way, doesn't it make sense for at least some of them to be negatively impacted by that?  I really hope you don't bring your accusatory and condemning attitude to your interactions with women who are struggling with their abortions.

TO ALL PRO-LIFE SUPPORTERS OUT THERE  Well, of course, I would be very happy if an anti-abortion law was passed...on one condition. Since we passed an anti-abortion law, why don't we pass a law similar to, say, the  buddy system . This way, all pro-life supporters who really really really wanted to take away the rights of Americans should have to pay 118,590 dollars over 18 years (average expenditures for a child in a low-income single-parent home). I'm sure when they are finally frustrated with paying for that child  unnecessarily  (like a mother who could have had an abortion), the pro-life supporters will stop denying the rights of others.  Because, you see, not all Americans are as rich as you are and many can't afford one or more child to take care of, especially teenage mothers. Forcing a mother to have a baby will, in most cases, exacerbate the economic conditions and welfare of the child as well as the parent(s).

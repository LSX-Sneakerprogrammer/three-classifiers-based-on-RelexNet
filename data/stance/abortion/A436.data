So you would say that it is better that 45 million + children die through abortion than a handful of women through a botched abortion. That doesn't sound like progress to me: That sounds like serious moral confusion. Go check out the stats on abortion rates through out the years and you will see a staggering peak after Roe vs Wade.  And yes, we would still have abortions, they would just be a whole lot fewer of them. Again, check out the stats on abortion rates before and after Roe vs Wade.

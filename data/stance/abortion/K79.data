Furthermore,, the verse in the Qur'aan that u referred to has got nothing to do with abortion.. it has to do with Christians..   Both the Koran and Bible verses support killing, in a manner that is illegal and therefore murder.  This contradicts your statement of   There is no religion that approves of murder! And it does involve a life that God and only God created.. so who are you to take away this life?!    Yes i did read the Qur'aan.. unfortunately though, when i came to read the Bible,, i didn't know which to believe because they each said something different even though they were supposed to be the same verses.. How can you have a New International Version(aka New Testament) of a HOLY book that was written by God in the first place and there are no messengers left in the world to reveal it??!   They are translations from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek or Arabic depending upon the verse. Those languages are not divine, however, they are human.

Even the devil can quote scripture for his own purposes.   You do not have the original, therefore everything you have written could completely botched up. It's just like a long game of telephone.   I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.   Killing a foetus is like killing a doll, really? since when did the world become so insensitive to teach someone to refer to an act such as abortion, as killing... a.. doll.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it. yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her, you be the one to watch it as it dies, if it isnt alive then why bother? We can only see thing's as human if they breathe talk and walk? Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable. I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.

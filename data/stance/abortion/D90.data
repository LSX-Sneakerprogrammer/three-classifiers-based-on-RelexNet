Abortion should not be legal. It causes massive deaths, and every human life has unailinable rights endowed by their CREATOR among these are LIFE, (FIRST) and liberty (SECOND) ... Abortion is always a sad and bad choice. I recently got off a flight from Beiging, China, where I met a VERY happy couple who waited 3 years to adopt the 8mos. old beautiful baby girl that they were finally bringing home with them. What a special occasion! Too bad it is so difficult to adopt here, because there are so few babies available, or they would have. The point is; life matters, and adoption is a positive, and very possible answer where BOTH the mother and baby can have bright futures. There are crisis pregnency centers in most towns with helpful people who care deeply about the mother, and baby. Wouldn't YOU prefer adoption over death for YOURSELF ? What CHOICE do you think the unbornbabies would make?? Who will give the baby, it's choice and chance ?.......Can we unite now? What kind of a society sentences these innocent unborn babies to DEATH, ...and gives LIFE sentences to guilty massmurderers ??? Thankfully, Virginia just voted to stop funding abortions with your taxes through Planned Parenthood ( see Wash. Post 2/28/08). Did you know that Planned Parenthood which sounds so good, is the number one provider of death by abortions ? It is also in approx. 180 other countries offering abortions with America's ( your tax ) money. Imagine forcing people with religious and other beliefs against abortion to pay for them through their taxes. That is what the government now does if not stopped. Lets not support Planned Parenthood, who is pro-abortion/death. Let's support the heroes at crisis pregnancy centers who can then better assist mothers in crisis before and after the babies birth...and lets vote pro-LIFE together from now on... God bless America,fathers, mothers and All size babies, unborn as well as born!   FYI, see:  Birthright, Lifeline,   Bethany Christian Services, Catholic Charities,  Prolife orgs.

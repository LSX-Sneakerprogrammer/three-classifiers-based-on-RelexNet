"if you were a baby, were going to be born and were aborted, you probably would care" this statement is all about "if". In reality, the fetus has no mental capacity to care about anything. Before it could survive outside of the mother's womb, it should be entirely the mother's choice, not society's. I believe this is about 20 weeks into the pregnancy.

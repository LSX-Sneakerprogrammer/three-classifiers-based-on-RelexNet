If you and your spouse have no STDs and you have sex with no one else how could you possible get an STD apart from a mishap at the doctors? The only safe sex is that in a monogamous marriage.   there is no question to when life begins: it's life throughout. The question is what kind of life?  So, if I make the choice to kill my neighbor using my own moral judgment; it's ok?

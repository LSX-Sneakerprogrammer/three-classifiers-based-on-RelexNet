Abortion is going to happen. Its been going on forever. People that are against it do so for moral reasons. I completely understand, but you are failing to realize that it will happen regardless of the legality of the procedure and in some cases is completely warranted. For example, what if your 14 year old daughter is raped and becomes pregnant. Does that not constitute a valid reason for the termination of a pregnancy. What if you are going to give birth to a child with a severe birth defect or extreme retardation. If it wasn't for new advances in medicine these people would never survive anyway, so how is it any different? It sounds harsh and heartless but it is reality none the less. Its like people that are against stem cell research because some of the stem cells come from aborted fetuses. Ok, you object on moral grounds, I get it but what if you're paralyzed and the researchers say a dead baby will help you walk again are you really going to tell me that you're not going to give the green light. The child was aborted regardless of what decision you made, at least let the horrible process have some good that comes out of it.

AGREED WITH ARY11 with everything!!!!!!!!  Educating our sexually active youth is vital! Perhaps if we actually took the time to properly discuss the consequences of having un-safe sex, then abortion wouldn't even have to be an issue. nonetheless, regardless of the consequence the decision is still the ONE person's. Which is the woman deciding to have/not have the abortion.

I've seen these videos. If it's not self-aware it's not a human yet, no matter what it  looks  like.  You're talking about  you're  feelings and what  you  believe because you're a typical self-righteous self-involved christian completely incapable of understanding that what  you  think and feel is not what everyone else thinks and feels.  The laws put in place on abortion take into account what  science  finds to be true  not how you  feel  helliom or what you think some invisible daddy in the sky wants you to feel.  Abortion is illegal after the third trimester except in extreme circumstances. Before then it's not a human yet, it's the specific woman's body and not yours, and it's none of your business.  That's how it is and that's how it should be,  no matter how many of you right wing nuts highjack this site and serial downvote us sane and logical participants on the site.

It would really suck to have to go through that. (giving birth to your rapists child) while I agree that there could not be many things worse than that, one of the things that would be worse, is death. Why should we force that death onto another party, who has no say in the situation, and is not at fault in any way? It is not right to ease the emotional suffering of one person, by killing another.

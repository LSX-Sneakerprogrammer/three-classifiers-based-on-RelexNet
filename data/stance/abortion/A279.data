Allow me to explain: I do believe that at a certain point in the pregnancy, abortion should not be legal. Where this point is, is what we should be debating. Clearly a single cell cannot think, see, etc... and therefore it is silly to consider this when an embreo has person status. Clearly you think that it should be illegal early in the pregnancy, but do you at least understand why it shouldn't be at conception?

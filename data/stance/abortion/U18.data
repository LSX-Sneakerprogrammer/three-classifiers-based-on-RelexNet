This whole 'pro-life' bullshit is mostly coming from religious fanatics who have been born and raised to repress women. They never had a chance to form their own independent thoughts because their parents shoved their opinions down their throats when they were too young to understand what was going on. I don't care what gender you are, what I do with my body is none of your business. Stop trying to take away my common human rights and actually do something useful, like EDUCATING OUR SEXUALLY-ACTIVE YOUTH!

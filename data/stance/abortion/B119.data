You make several erroneous Assertions in your post.   Atheism is not a religion. It is the rejection of religion. It requires no active belief. If there were no theists there would be no atheists - we'd all just be people. Atheist is a rejection of Theism. Much like no believing in unicorns or leprechauns or anything else people claim exists but can't prove exists. Not believing in something is not a religion or else we all belong to hundreds of religions.  Abortion does prevent unwanted children. There are 1.25 Million abortions performed in the US every year. Currently there are less than 200.000 families trying to adopt. You do the math. We'd vastly outstrip the adoptive parents in the first year alone.  Women ages 20-24 are not out of high school adn college. a 4 year degree means you graduate when you are 22, some may never go but some also get higher degrees or go part time, or take a year off - so many 20-24 year olds are not out of college.

"There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it? If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.  Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law. The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it.   Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide. But if a doctor kills only one of those persons; no charge.   The Supreme Court by their ruling overturned the law they were supposed to uphold. The right thing to do would be to overturn this erroneous ruling and restore our rule of law.

"People often try to personalize their pro-life argument by saying ""imagine if YOUR mother had aborted YOU! YOU wouldn't be here!"" Well, to that I say I wouldn't have cared, I wouldn't have had the capacity to care! But people believe in reincarnation might say that I'd be somebody else! Another person! Probably still to the same mother! Who knows.... But if at the time, she really didn't want to have me, then I say it's her choice.

"I've lost everybody in this thread... can we just say that:  - stabbing a dog anywhere is kinda sick and is not ok (unless you eat dogs like in some countries).   - abortion should not be outlawed until week 20 into the pregnancy.  - people who are pro-life should keep their point of view and not force it on others and make them feel like they're murders, cos it's not like killing a person.

"I would just like to add one more thing. Everyone who is for abortion seems to insist this should solely be the woman's decision. Why is that? What about the father? Why should he have no say in a child that he would have to bear legal responsibility to if it were born?  Suppose, a father says he does not want the child and she has it anyway. He is still legally liable to this child. Now, suppose the opposite. He wants the child, is willing to raise this child without any financial support from the mother and is willing to bear all financial burden of the mother while she is unable to work. He should not have this right?

"When the man has sex with a woman, he knows he is potentially creating a life. He must be prepared to accept whether the woman wants to keep it. It's inside her, not him.   Consider you taking your child over to a neighbour and asks him to babysit the child while you go out for dinner. The neighbour shouldn't have to babysit just because you asked him. He has to look after the child, so he has the choice to do it or not. You are responsible for this child whether he wants to babysit or not.

"The father doesn't have to carry the baby for nine months and then have it wreak havoc on his body while he pushes it out of a hole four sizes too small. If he does make the offer to fully support the child without the mother being around, good for him, but he still can't force her to carry and birth it.

"It's a moving story, yes. However the boy is now a life! Before it became a life, it was only a potential life attached to its mother and is completely dependent on her. Only she should have the say in whether it should be kept or not.

"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.   Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:   Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.   This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.   Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.   First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.   There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.   Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.   In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.   Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong.   My own mother has 6 children and has never had an abortion!!

"Life doesn't begin at conception. A pregnancy is a PROCESS of creating a life. This process begins with CONCEPTION. So conception is merely the beginning of a process.   Before the fetus can actually be kept alive outside of the mother's womb by society, then the mother alone must have the choice. Society should not take away her choice unless society can keep it alive without her.

"There is a VERY simple answer to the abortion debate:  Abortion should NOT be a form of birth control. It should ONLY be allowed (as a final solution) in the event of a pregnancy resulting from rape, incest, or other sexual crime.
",0
"That sounds like YOUR solution to a minority of people. Don't you dare make everyone abide by the minority's rules. If it was a simple answer, it wouldn't be such a huge issue.   Abortion isn't a form of birth control like condoms or the pill, for those directly involved it's a difficult choice that they have to make because bringing a human life up is no easy task. It's not like having a pet (and even that is a big ask because not all pet owners are responsible).  Again, it's the choice of those directly involved. It doesn't affect anybody else's life, so leave it alone.

"Of all the arguments I have made about this issue I think it comes down to this simple fact; Abortion should be banned because the most dangerous place in America shouldn't be the womb.  I say this because statistically speaking more human beings are killed there everyday than anywhere else. That in my opinion simply should not be.

"I would like to offer some clarification on the question ""can I kill it"" and the follow-up question ""what is it""  As I have stated before; the taking of human life requires a high level of justification. No argument that I've seen for abortion rises to the level of proper justification. Please note what I'm discussing; the taking of human life, not any life but human life in particular.   So what does that have to do with the question ""can I kill it"" That question needs to be clarified; hence the follow up question. What I want you to notice is what kind of question ""what is it"" is. It is an ontological question. We're asking about the very nature of the thing in question. And that's important because it determines how we answer the first question. But notice this is a strictly ontological question; it is not a question about level of dependence or development. Why is that important? Because if the thing in question, ontologically speaking, is human then it requires a high level of justification to kill it. If it's not human, no justification is necessary. I'm not saying if it's human you can't kill it, sometimes you can and must but you must properly justify your actions. This is were abortion fails because the only reason it gives for the most part is because the mother just choose to. And yes I'm sure she went through some tough decisions but bottom line; she wants to. Because the fact is she doesn't have to; she has other options.   But what happens when you kill without proper justification? You have to find a way to justify the act because your conscience is smitting you. This is always done by making the victim less than human or not human at all. Because after all if it's not human, no justification is necessary. And this is were I have seen all the arguments for abortion go. They leave the ontological question and move to other areas that are more easily justifiable. Most of them are framed like this:  can I kill it? What is it? it's just a..... Well of course you can  They all answer yes by qualifying the object by something that is easier to justify; a standard that is lower not higher. But let's answer the question head on and notice how the gravity of the question changes when we answer the follow-up question correctly. And by correctly I mean answering the question according to the kind of question it is, an ontological question.  can I kill it? What is it? It's a human, one at the very early stages of it's development......   So let's take the question of this debate head on; Should abortion be banned?   What is abortion?   The taking of a human life at the very early stages of it's development.   Why would you want to do that?   Because I don't want the inconvenience of a child.  Does that sound like proper justification for the taking of human life, especially the weakest and most vulnerable human life?  I have reduced, intentionally, all reasons for an abortion to a matter of convenience because ultimately that's what it comes down to. If a pregnancy, regardless of how it came about, stands between you and what you want it's an inconvenience; and we all know what we do with inconveniences. But this one is a little sticker because it's human. But if we can take away or cloud it's humanity then it will be easier to do.   So should abortion be banned? Of course it should, for obvious reasons.

"The fundamental issue regarding the abortion debate is not women's rights or other factors which concern personal autonomy, but over the status of the unborn child. Variants of the personal choice argument presuppose that the unborn child is not a human person, for if the unborn child is indeed a human person, then no amount of freedom justifies its elective termination. Henceforth, variants of the personal autonomy argument beg the question by presupposing their conclusions: they are valid if and only if the unborn are not human persons.  First premise is that it is prima facie morally wrong to kill any person. Jane English makes an interesting point that this is not always the case. For example, would not self-defense be a legitimate example of when killing a person is justified? However, the abortion opponent could also claim that fetus' are innocent entities, but even then prima facie it would seem that self-defense would still be legitimate.  A fetus is a person because it posses ""intrinsic potentials"". However, before that he admits that an argument that shows unborn are persons because they have the persons to become persons is absurd...

"A fetus is not a parasite. Its an undeveloped human. No skin cells, hair follicles or any other bunch of cells. A undeveloped human. A woman has eggs for reproduction. These eggs have to be fertilized to create a fetus. If left unchecked as long as the fetus is healthy a human being will be formed inside the womans womb. If a woman doesnt want a child its her responsibility to prevent it from getting started. Women have plenty of ways to prevent unwanted prgnancy. Killing a fetus is wrong. Its a very young human. You can argue details but bottom line is it will one day, if all goes well,become a functioning member of the human race. Terminating this is murder. The question we need to ask is why do we have this problem in our ""advanced"" civilization. Most abortions are from unwanted pregnancy not rapes or medical conditions. Are women not ready for their rights? Mass murder of undeveloped humans because of irresponsibilty. We shouldn't condone this behavior as a womans right. WE should condemn because its a womans responsibility to be a mother when she decides to create a fetus.

"Abortion is a terrible thing. Abortion dosn't make you un-pregnant, it makes you a mom of a dead baby. Have the kid and put it up for adoption. Just think, that child could find the cure for cancer or do something extremely great. Abortion is horrible and should be banned ASAP!

"""I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.""  So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby? I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.  Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.  I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.  Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human? I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks. It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane?  If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement. I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant. If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.  You're view seems to be very black and white, and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists. Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned

"Let me clarify my position, since I misstated it. The first question that needs to be asked is "" what kind of life is it?"" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.  I find it rather disturbing that we want to have sex without commitments so badly that we are willing to kill the result of that sexual union.  But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire. Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed. But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good. We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt. But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces, guilt and death. With God there is forgiveness, but not without great cost.

"Yes, abortion should be banned. What about adoption? They need to stand up for the mistake they made and have the baby, and if it is unwanted, put it up for adoption. Just don't kill it. I understand that the baby really isn't a baby yet but if a baby isn't wanted, then the person needs to have safe sex. It isn't the baby's fault.

"I think that abortion is absolutely wrong in all ways because it's killing a innocent life. For all you know, that baby could've been the one to make a cure for cancer or AIDS. I think that in a situation such as being raped, that the baby is innocent and the baby had nothing to do with whoever raped you, it's not the baby fault. There are all kinds of options in the world like adoption that you could choose if you don't want your baby. Unplanned pregnancy is no reason to have an abortion because I feel like if you had sex willingly then you knew what the possible outcome could be. I AM 100% AGAINST ABORTION FOR ANY REASON. NO BABY DESERVES THAT!

"You are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity, which can't happen because God gave man free will. Of course it is not morally right if you are a Christian, but not everyone is a Christian and you have to respect their rights as well. Did not Jesus command, 'love your neighbor as yourself'? Your neighbor could be a Christian, atheist, wiccan, whatever, could they not? It is not up to you to judge someone, leave that to God. No matter what you do or say, people will continue to have abortions in the world. It is an unfortunate fact of life, similar to war, similar to racism, similar to obesity. You see them committing a sin and loudly call them out, but you are being hypocritical because you also sin. You are saying that you are perfect and never sin, which, unless you are Jesus coming back down again, is impossible. I am a Christian as well, but I realize that it is wrong to judge and criticize someone for sinning when I do the same thing as well, albeit a different type. Like I said earlier, leave the judging to God.

"So let me see if I understand you. Killing children isn't actually wrong. It is only if you believe it is. So what Hitler did was good because he thought it was. And it would be good, by your logic, to kill you so long as I believed it was right. Since when does right and wrong depend on what one believes? This is certainly not the view of right and wrong that Jesus of Nazareth held. To be a follower of Him means to hold the same worldview has he does.  About loving: To love someone means to seek the very best for them and protect them from what harms them, You can't say you love someone and then stand by when they are being harmed when it is within your power to do something. Humans in the early stages of life just happen to be your neighbor. Go back and read the passage on the Good Samaritan. Your position is the one the Pharisee took and the one Jesus condemned.  about judging: The passage of scripture were Jesus deals with judging doesn't condemn judging nor forbid it. It does condemn judging hypocritically however. It then goes on to say "" first remove the log from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers""   If judging is wrong for you? why did you judge what I wrote? are you saying that you are perfect and never sin? I guess you don't leave the judging to God do you.

"No, you are way out in left field. Stop the red herrings and keep it to the topic. What does Hitler have to do with abortions? As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself. Let me ask you, what did Jesus believe about abortions, since you feel that my interpretation is not right? What is the view of right and wrong according to Jesus of Nazareth?  You stand by and watch people kill each other during war. What kind of love is this? Yes, you can do something concerning abortions. Judging them as a murderer however does not encompass this. That is the main point of my argument. I am saying you cannot judge someone to be murderer and that they are automatically going to hell because they have an abortion.  What do you mean by 'judging what I wrote'? Judging to me is calling a male gay because he wears pink, calling a person retarded because they fail a grade in school, and calling a person hell-bound who has an abortion. Apparently you did not read the last part of my statement concerning sin. Also, I need to know what your definition of judging is, since you disagree with mine.

"Lets see Hitler killed people. abortions kill people. Wow your right, no correlation at all, a true red herring.  Want to know what Jesus taught about abortion, right and wrong and judging people? Go get your Bible and knock off the dust because it would be wise to ask Him not me.  Final thought; We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of God, all of us are going to prison for a long time for comic treason. And since the one we offended is infinite in worth, the debt we owe is infinite also. So consider what infinity minus 10 thousand is, infinity. That's how long it will take to pay the debt.   But that's not the question at hand is it; it's about abortion. And for that there is only one question; what's being killed? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. No one needs justification to remove a tumor do they? But if it's a human being killed in an abortion then no justification is adequate.  So if you think abortions shouldn't be banned, please tell me exactly what is being killed in an abortion,

"Hitler was a murderer for having abortions? Like I said, keep it to the topic.   Hmm, lets see...You dispute me, I ask for evidence as to why you dispute me, you come up with ""go check the Bible."" I'm still waiting for the evidence. I ask two simple questions. What did Jesus say about abortions? What is right and wrong according to Jesus? I mean, if you want to cop out and not answer them, you shouldn't keep the debate going, since you were the one who disputed me.  We are all lawbreakers. So how should one type of sin get emphasized over the other? God looks at every sin the same way, except for blasphemy against HS. A person who commits a murder commits the same sin in the eyes of God as someone who lies. Why are you trying to deny it? You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours, because you are not God, and God does not judge sins that way except for one, blasphemy against HS. ""Go get your Bible"" if you think I am wrong.   I can't keep arguing with you if you continue to take the debate off topic. We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion. I have said this throughout my past statements, yet you want to keep diverting the topic to something you feel comfortable with. I put my first statement under the 'abortions should be banned' view for a reason. The question is not about what is being killed in an abortion. Obviously it is a human being imo. Again, stop cop-ing out and keep it to the topic. Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?

"The funny thing is you say that I say a whole lot of things that I can't find in the things I write. Maybe you could help me out and tell me were I said such things like: ""Hitler was a murderer for having abortions""  ""You have no right to tell someone that their sin is worse than yours"". I said that?  ""Should you judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?"" Were did i do that? I thought the question was; Should abortion be banned.   And help me with this one: ""We are talking specifically about whether you should judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion.""  Who is judging someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion?  Please show me were I said that.  Just for the record; my view is that everyone of us, apart from the grace of Jesus Christ, is hell bound for the high crime of cosmic treason, aka idolatry. Romans 1:18-25  Romans 1:25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.  If I remember correctly you responded to a post I made quoting Greg Koukl who i thought made a very good point regarding the question of this debate and you responded with, you can't use that, it's Christian. How very judgmental of you.  Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches. I'll help you out. And note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here. That's an objective standard, not a subjective one as you suggest. And he says in the last passage that all men will be judged by this law. That means it applies to all men, at all times and in all places. that is the polar opposite of what you say.  So one of you has got to be wrong.  Matthew 19:17-19   17 So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”  18 He said to Him, “Which ones?”  Jesus said, “ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ 19 ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”  Matthew 5:20   For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.

"infer (v)- to derive by reasoning; conclude or judge from premises or evidence  -----  I have stated in my previous arguments that you should not judge someone as a murderer and hell-bound if they have an abortion, and you disputed my argument. Therefore, I can infer that you are against what I have said.  ----  I can see now that we have been arguing two different questions. The question is not about whether abortions should be banned or not. I already answered that they should, with there being exceptions for special circumstances. One of those special circumstances I mentioned was rape, and you disputed me on that circumstance. That does not mean that I am against abortions being banned; I would like for that to happen. I think you got mixed up when I said that and inferred wrongly.   -----  Practically all Christians are against abortions, because it goes against what the Bible says. I am against them too, however I do not believe it is right to judge someone in a negative manner if they do have an abortion. The same goes for gays as well concerning harassment. You shouldn't judge someone, period. When you judge someone, it eventually leads to hate, and God will not forgive you if you do not forgive you neighbor for what they have done. People make bad decisions every day. Their (people having abortions) sin should not be ridiculed upon or emphasized as one of the worst sins, because we also commit sin, and God looks at every sin the same way, except for the one I mentioned in my previous statement. You should tell them that what they are doing is sinful and pray for them, but I don't believe you should harass them and look down upon them for what they have done.  -----  I am inferring that you are a Christian, although I may be wrong. Could you specify what religion you follow? I am a nondenominational evangelical.  -----  I get what you are saying with Romans 1:18-25, but what you fail to realize is that although a person has an abortion, that does not mean that they cannot be forgiven of it and become Christians later on. The only sin in which you cannot be forgiven is blasphemy against the HS (Mark 3:29). You should not degrade them for what they have done, but encourage them to turn to God so that He can forgive them of their past wrongdoings.   -----   How very judgmental of you.   You took it out of context. Read the entire paragraph and you will see my response. I also put in in bold in response to your other statement.  -----   Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches.   Wow, and you are calling me judgmental...  -----   note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here.   Jesus condensed them into two commandments for Christians to follow. See Matthew 22:36-40. They revolve around love, not murder.  -----  Hmmm...so let me see here. According to the verses you mentioned, you believe that you must follow the Ten Commandments in order to have eternal life? I want to make sure I understand your point of view, because I disagree with it if it is so.     Romans 10:9,10  ""If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.""  Ephesians 2:8,9:  ""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from youselves, it is the gift of God-- not by works , so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do""  I can't go on until I know which religion you follow, but it is clear from these two verses that if you are a Christian, you are saved by faith in God, not by obeying the Ten Commandments. Paul touches on this in his letters. I don't have the time right now to look them all up, but I will list them later on if you would like me to.

"You are correct in your assessment of me. Doctrinally I consider myself a Reformed Baptist, but primarily a follower of the historical Jesus of Nazareth. I also think we agree for the most part, however I took exception with several things you said because I found them to be inconsistent with a Christian World-view. Primarily your statement that Christian morality applies solely to Christians. That is known as moral relativism (for a full discussion of this please see the book by Francis J. Beckwith and Greg Koukl titled: Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air ) The scripture I quoted was to make the point that morality, according to Jesus, was objective. I was very explicit about that; to infer anything beyond that is to read into what I said something that is not there.   I also took and take exception to your insistence that we are commanded not to judge. The only thing I can find is a command not to judge hypocritically and then a command to judge once we have dealt with our own sin. I do agree with your sentiment of judgmentalism and the holier than thou attitude I think your are trying to address. If we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone then we have nothing in which to boast. Even the faith I have is a gift from God Ephesians 2:8 I am by nature a murderer and hell bound sinner and deserving of the wrath of God, but I have received mercy and I 'm now commanded to go and show mercy as I have been shown mercy.  But I ask how are we to fulfill the great commission if we first don't judge that people are murderers( see the sermon on the mount) and hell-bound? If there is no peril, there is no need of a savior and no need to warn people. And that means that Jesus died in vain. But Jesus made a judgment, people are murderers and hell-bound and it matters not how they got there, only that they need to be saved. And He asked me to go for Him and seek and save that which is lost. If I'm His follower than I'll do what he commands me.  “If you love Me, keep My commandments"" John 14:15   Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen. Matthew 28:19-20

"No, as a Christian, I believe the morality that God gave and still gives applies to everyone of every race, regardless of religion. There is no such thing as another religion, for they are committing idolatry. Either you interpreted my statement wrongly or I misspoke. I don't believe morals are relative to peoples of a certain religion or a certain culture. If I did, I wouldn't be a Christian because I would be contradicting myself and my beliefs.   I think it is important that we go over the verses in question and see the meaning behind it.  Matthew 7:1-5  ""Stop judging others and you will not be judged. For others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged. And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? How can you think of saying, 'let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from your own eye; then perhaps you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.""  My interpretation of these verses are that Jesus is warning you from judging someone else for their sin when you sin even worse, in other words being hypocritical. Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20). You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching. You see what I am saying? You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur. To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone. We are to judge the  sin  as murder, and always with the goal of helping the  person  see that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin. Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve? It doesn't solve anything. This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7.   On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus. Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved.

"There is a difference between refuting and ignoring. I addressed every point you made and didn't keep bringing up topics that were irrelevant to the debate, such as Hitler.   Abortion for Rape Victims?  By Gregory Koukl   You are assuming from a Christian article that everyone in the world must believe in Christianity,  which can't happen because God gave man free will.    So what Hitler did was good because he thought it was.    What does Hitler have to do with abortions?    To be a follower of Him means to hold the same worldview has he does.    As I said earlier, one of two commandments to adhere to as a Christian (that Jesus said himself in the gospels) is to love your neighbor as yourself.    We are all lawbreakers and apart from the grace of God    We are all lawbreakers.

"Well, once it is a child, it already is illegal to kill it.  Before the first tri-mester it's a cluster of cells with no more self-awareness than a kitchen table.  So that wouldn't be ""killing a child"" at all.  And don't start with the potential bs. Because by that logic you would also have to outlaw masterbation, and save every ejaculation in a cup separating out the thousands of sperms representing ""potential"" life and finding female eggs to inject them in.  ...

"I would go as far as saying that before the fetus can digest milk (which means it can be sustained without direct connection to the mother via the umbilical cord), it is a dependent part of the mother like any other organ and she should have the choice to remove it.

"Hmmm if you were a baby and were going to be born and you were aborted, you probably would care.   We wouldn't care. We couldn't.  As a fetus the natural drive humans have for survival really isn't there. The mental capacity just wouldn't exist to care.
",1
"Yes, you are absolutely right, it is illegal to kill a child, but just because it a simple ""cluster of cells"" in the early stages of pregnancy, does that give us any further right to destroy it? Not convinced? Perhaps this example will help my point:  You are walking through a farm one day, and you stumble upon a chicken egg that has been freshly laid. You step on it, and guess what? You have commited murder!  I instantly know the reply to that statement, after all, it's just an egg, so therefore there isn't any developed life growing inside... yet! It doesn't matter how far the stages of development have gone, because there is ultimately going to be a child, and forcing an early abortion is the prevention of life, and in my eyes, is nothing short of an abortion at say the six month stage of a human pregnancy.  By the way, if I may add this, then I would say that your view on the ""potential bs,"" and how we should ""outlaw masterbation,"" is either incredibly misguided, or incredibly stupid. Need I remind you that there are several billion sperm cells in each male. So, how many sperm cells are produced during the process of masterbation? I certainly wouldn't think billions, millions, or even several thousands!

"Oh jeez,   I don't know where you and that J whatever guy came from, but your critical thinking skills are absolutely awful on this topic.

This is every time a guy cums. Look it up. There stored in you, if you don't jack it or screw they're dissolved in the body or come out in your sleep. But it's a sperm holocaust literally everyday within our bodies.  And I used that example to show J whatever exactly how silly the ""potential"" life argument is.  Potential life is not a legitimate excuse against abortion. Because, exactly... like... I... said... we destroy thousands of potential lives every single time we masturbate, or don't masturbate, or even when we do have sex.

Any scientist will tell you what reproduction means the world to the human race.  Maybe it's a parasite to you, but it's something completely different in the end isn't it?  Look, I don't care about all this BS with ""what is a child and what isn't,"" it isn't even the point of my argument.  My point is that a child cannot voice an opinion, and that sometimes, to prevent the worst, someone has to voice it for them. If we were all like you, saying that it should be completely up to the mother, then there'll be no need to second guess how the population will be affected.

What about unchecked reproduction like in China and India where the one child policy has created more problems and actual murders then is necessary?

"""You all keep telling us that it's murder!""   Murder is not the word that I would use.  I see an abortion as an unnecessary decision, one which could have been prevented but instead has been inconsiderately acted upon.   Instead of hitting the problem on the head, we are circling the issue. By this I refer to the fact that an unwanted pregnancy is the source of the problem, yet we do nothing to stop this issue; instead, we are nailing the leaf and not the stem by aborting the unwanted child. So, while unwanted pregnancies climb, so do the rate of abortion.  Were we to actually decide that we should perhaps try to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies, we would finally be making a difference. We just need to make certain that education finds a way to influence the minds of all teens and couples, so that an unwanted pregnancy becomes a thing of the past, as will abortion. Then we simply push abortion to the side, as we will have finally killed a major weed in the garden of life.  In another argument, you stated that we should instead outlaw unprotected sex, which is the  biggest amount of BS that I have heard in this debate!  Think about it: suddenly we are no longer able to freely create as we please, pro-creation becomes a thing of the past, and the rate of childbirth drops in the high thousands. And as for 'fining' unprotected sex or using 'jail-time' as a punishment; that is  just plain stupid . The Government  can  have a say in education, but they  cannot  examine each and every couple for a condom each and every time that they have sex. It would be a full time job with prostitutes.  So, hopefully I've cleared up a few things, and hopefully you finally understand where I am coming from.

"Ok, if you really want to ""hit the problem on the head"" or ""nail the stem"" then what you want to do is deal with unprotected sex! That's where the source of the problem is, a pregnancy is the result of THAT! You don't see that?  You go on and on and on about education, which I'm not opposing at all. I'm all for education. What you've failed to do is come up with any feasible educational solution at all, then you even reject my best suggestion to deal with the problem at hand, and you reject it with your BS logic that makes no sense.   Your only answer to this thing is making abortion illegal, that's a great solution pal! Way to deal with everything! Let's just make everything illegal, even if only a portion of the community FEELS it should be!... You people make me sick!

"Ok, I see the problem now (and it's not the fact that you're 15 because I don't care about your age or gender), it is: you are unable to form any comprehensible form of logics in any of your arguments. Initially I thought I was debating with someone of fair intelligence with the ability to make clear logical arguments, but that opinion has simply dissipated. It scares me that people like you could be in parliament affecting lots of lives. Here's why:  You say ""abortion is a problem, not a solution"" - ummm this is YOUR VIEW. My view is that it's NOT a problem but a RESULT of unwanted pregnancies (which is the real problem (and you admit this in the next couple of sentences. Your point is now out the window, so let's see you actually rebut that directly with something else. Alas you probably will, but not with logic.  An episode of Maury Povich? Is that a fictional TV show? You're using that as a basis for your educational system? FYI, the guest speaker tactic has been done to death everywhere. But its impact is still minimal, it's not reaching enough people. Again, my suggestion of putting a hefty fine on unwanted pregnancies would have more impact.  Ok I'm not going to chew your ""making a law on abstinence"" to pieces, it's essentially dealing with the problem of unwanted pregnancies. We may have some common ground here. I've actually moved past the ""banning unprotected sex"" arguments to now suggest ""making unwanted pregnancies expensive and coupling it with something rehabilitative like a compulsory education on the whole thing.""  The problem of rape has already been dealt with. It's called ILLEGAL and includes a jail term. No need to discuss that here.  Banning abortion wouldn't be necessary if you're actually dealing with the problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. So you say that you're not one who push their belief on others and that you're ""educative"". Then you should stop calling for a ban on abortion. You say you do a lot of research and self-educating on the topic, how come you think banning something will make it go away?

"You are incorrect in stating, ""if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide."" You would only be charged with two counts of homicide if the prosecution can prove the baby could have survived outside of the womb.

This topic demands what a person ""thinks"" and ""feels,"" not how he pulls out a statistic or two and calls a problem an ""effect."" The correct answer is that an abortion is both, and yet you fail to see how I have clearly solved the problem for both sides.   Rape is illegal, and yet it still happens.  Think about that.  If you actually ""pieced"" my arguments together, you would actually notice that I am actually not calling for an immediate ban on abortions.

So logically, if abortion is banned, so should (by pro-lifer logic even) all those things listed.  There's no way for you to escape that. Not that your arguments have ever been bound by logic thus far.

"great, another one.  I've read it. I've read it a million times on this lame debate alone. You're not saying anything new, there's no great revelation anywhere in your arguement.  None of what you say in any way points toward any kind of self-awareness. Science says it's not a baby, and nothing you said will stop a single abortion from happening.  So stop, find another cause. Abortions have been going on since the beginning of time and all this foaming-at-the-mouth zealous ignorance has never stopped a single one. Every time in history you zealous foaming-at-the-mouth looney tunes have gotten your way and made abortion illegal it has lead to nothing but a bunch of dead little girls from botched abortions, and still not a single abortion is ever stopped.  If  you  don't want an abortion,  you  don't have to get one. But if some poor young girl thinks that's her best option, then that's  her  choice.  If god or whoever doesn't like it, then he can come down here and tell her himself.  Stay out of it.

"I find the fact that there are instances where women think that it is right to abort the birth of a child is incredibly outrageous! To think that people would rather cut of life in its entirety than to take wiser options, such as setting their child up for an adoption, or even personally entrusting the baby to someone close to them. If I could 'personally' define the word 'abortion,' then it would be as follows:  'ABORTION: The term refers to the irrational decision to KILL the child before it has been birthed from the womb'  I am not going to sugar-coat abortions, because it's true, they are nothing short of murder! 'The children are killed before they can even process the thought' is one term that I have seen a few times in this debate (of course they have been worded differently, but again, I am not here to sugar-coat this sort of thing), and I can say that the mother/father has STOLEN the right and privilege of thought from these children by killing them. They have also denied them of love, care, protection and most of all, they have denied them of a life.  As I have stated previously, I cannot even begin to understand why so many pregnant women do not consider putting the child up for an adoption rather than simply cutting the child off completely! Surely the majority of you all would agree with me that a child has its rights even if it cannot understand them! But the second that an abortion begins, you have stripped that child of it's rights, and there is no way that you can ever make amends.   And no, I am not trying to send anyone on a guilt-trip, but I would be glad to know that some of you have come to realize what exactly an abortion does, and not just to think of the process as ""stabbing someone in the vagina.""

"Before it's able to survive outside of the woman's womb, it's only a potential life, not an actual life. Society cannot keep it alive so society should not interfere.   As a potential, it is in the same class as a single egg or sperm. Of course, once birthed the child still has no guarantee of life due to SIDS, diseases, etc... but at least it has a better chance of survival. So, before the period of 20 weeks, it has no chance of survival outside of the womb, so the woman should have the choice of keeping it or not.

"A fetus is a stage of development. The genes are what determines what kind of fetus it is. So when a human being has an abortion she takes the life of a human fetus, not the fetus of a dog or cat, a human fetus. About the condom. Using a condom is what you do before fertilization to try and prevent fertilization. An abortion is what you do after fertilization has occurred to stop further growth of the product of fertilization. And when done on humans it ends the life of a human in the early stages of development. Them are the facts; abortions on humans ends the life of a human, using condoms prevents the fertilization of the human sperm and egg.
",0
"Well, if you read my argument towards iamdavidh's argument on potential life in regard to sperm cells, you will understand that there are major differences to what is potential and what is actually fertilizing as we type.  The fact that women consider an abortion as the first choice (or for that matter any choice) is too weak for some people, this includes me.  What individuals fail to see, and admit, is that there is always another option, whether it be putting the child up for adoption or to leave the child in the care of a friend or family member, so that the child has a life and it is still able to give a couple what they actually want.  People are so financial these days that they forget about human rights, something that a child deserves. We can all look at what science determines is a child and what isn't, but it is but some of us, who actually believe and support human life, will look as a fetus as a child, regardless of its understanding and capabilities.  If someone isn't fit or capable of having a child, have safe sex, or if it is too late, give the child to someone who is. Everybody wins.
",0
"Until the fetus can actually survive outside the womb, it's a potential. Fertilization doesn't all of a sudden make an egg or a sperm instantaneous life. A lot of things must be perfect for the embryo to make it all the way to the end. If people drink too much alcohol it might kill the embryo, there's a host of other things that can affect its survival, shall we outlaw them all?  I fully support giving people choice when it comes to other options. What I don't support is making it compulsory. Plain and simple.

"As I have already mentioned, several times, other choices are avaliable, and yet, many couples/individuals choose to ignore these choices. What I suggest is that protective sex must come into play, this way, we can completely forget about the possibility of an abortion.  The only exception that I could possibly see to this is with the case of rape, and this is only covers 1% of all abortions.  If abortions are outlawed, the world may finally smarten up when it comes to sex and childbirth, and then, just maybe, we can start worrying more about the future of the child rather than the beginning.
",0
"This argument has already been covered, so I don't know why you're repeating it. But since you have, i will reply again:  Protective sex is the act of preventing life from happening in the first place. You're preventing fertilization from happening, some view this as on the same level as abortion so since abstinence or condoms are not outlawed, neither should abortion.  I get you're trying to make people realize the consequences of having unprotected sex, so what you should argue for is that UNPROTECTED SEX SHOULD BE BANNED, not abortion should be banned! Abortion is dealing with the aftermath, so let it be dealt with! If you want to PREVENT, then outlaw UNPROTECTED SEX. Make it illegal! Just like riding a bike without a helmet! It's illegal to ride bikes without helmets (at least in some countries).
",1
"This is what I derive from your argument:  ""We should not outlaw abortion, we should outlaw unprotected sex. This is because we want to prevent children from coming into this Earth, or kill them off should accidents happen.""  This system is complete and utter BS, and would do more harm than good.  If we wanted to prevent children from being born, we should educate, and provide more condoms and help encourage abstinence among teenagers and couples. This way, we can eventually move past outlawing unprotected sex and stop abortions for good.  What you suggest does nothing to promote any form of childbirth. It doesn't give a single solution that doesn't cause more problems.
",0
"You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?  Just compare it with many other things that are illegal: riding a bike without helmet, not wearing a seatbelt in a car. Most of the time, the cops don't know if you're wearing your seatbelt or not! But they certainly would know if you crashed your car!!! So if unprotected sex is made illegal (outside of a committed relationship) people can risk it if they want, but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!!! Then you'd be fined lots of money, or the fine should be built into the cost of an abortion!!! That should be a deterent, wouldn't you say? Eventually people will learn that it's not good to have unprotected sex, they won't have to be told any more. Like wearing a seatbelt in a car, it's become second nature to people now.  ""Promoting childbirth""? I'm sorry but this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population? That's just dictatorship, pure and simple. You want more people, so you force people to give birth? Go live in a country run by a dictatorship, that's should suit you perfectly.
",1
"""You don't think making unprotected sex illegal is a workable option?""   That's exactly what I think!  Riding a bike without a helmet is not a good comparison when comparing it to sex. Sure, it shows that the consequences could be fatal, but with the case of pregnancy, one life is certainly at risk, and that could easily become two.   ""...this sounds like you're trying to increase the world's population?""   Again, you are making assumptions, and they are wrong.  I am all for childbirth, it keeps the system moving. I am against overpopulation. I suggest that rather than kill of a mistake, we educate to prevent the mistake from occurring. Overpopulation is way off the point; my point is that childbirth keeps the population where it should be!   ""...but if the girl is pregnant and you seek abortion, then the authorities would know about it!!!""   Then it is too late.  You have just admitted something that I have stated in a previous argument:  ""unprotected sex will become the next underground drug.""  And guess what else? Then you see STD's creep back into the problem, in fact, potentially much worse than it was before! And sure, perhaps  some  people will learn, but not  all.   You need to admit that banning unprotected sex is a failing system with too many flaws to test. We need to educate productively if we are going to get anywhere with this problem!
",0
"Ok, if outlawing unprotected sex makes it go underground like the drug scene, you don't think the same will happen to abortion if you outlaw that? So many people have brought up the point that outlawing abortion doesn't make it go away, it simply makes the practice unsafe and much riskier.   You're contradicting your own points, so just leave it and relax your views a little bit.   You also agree that we should educate to prevent mistakes from occuring. That's already happening so we're not arguing about that.  You say it's too late to find out about an illegal activity after the consequences? How else can you find out about an illegal activity? Something must happen to bring it to the authorities' attention, duh! How does anyone know if you're wearing your seatbelt when you drive? They don't!!!! But if you have an accident, it becomes apparent, then the law applies! Is it too late? May be it's too late for the driver, but does it serve to educate? YES!!!

"""I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.""  So a thirteen year old girl gets raped, and you're saying that the govenrment have the right to force that girl to keep her unwanted baby? I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.  Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.  I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion.   Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human? I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks. It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane?   If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement. I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant. If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.   You're view seems to be very black and white, and you seem to dismiss the huge grey area that exists. Abortion exists for a reason and should not be banned

We have all heard about how traumatizing foster care can be for a lot of children who end up having a lot of mental issues and distress when they are older. Yeah you may be keeping a child a live but when you think about what they have to go through as children in the system is it really worth it? And not to mention if they do get adopted young and find out when they are older it is going to be extremely hard for them. When people get abortions the baby cant process it or know!!

No one is for abortion once the child is self-aware. A self-aware human should not be aborted.  That is  not  a self-aware human, no matter how cute.

Why not err on the side of life?   If we don't know, and this debate demonstrates that, then why not use caution and restraint? It's seems to me that if this issue of abortion is ""debatable"" then it would be unwise to throw open the gates of permission.   What if we are wrong and it turns out that we have actually snuffed out the life of over 45 million children? I think the guilt of that would have a more profound affect on our nation than thousands of women who die from back ally abortions. See, in abortion we as a nation are complicate in the act because we as a nation sanctioned it. In the back ally abortion we have no guilt because the parties acted contrary to our law.

But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire. Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed. But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good.

"Well, the question is what makes us a person, and what makes us special above those beings which are okay to kill (most animals, insects plants etc...). I would argue that it's our ability to think and feel at a higher level.   An embryo cannot think, feel, see, hear, remember, or do any of the other things that distinguish us as people and therefore must be put into a separate category then a fully formed person.  Considering your ignorance on the topic of biology that you demonstrated in the evolution debate, I would not be surprised if you were unaware of this, but if you don't believe me I would be happy to provide evidence (or you could save me the trouble and trust me).  The question then becomes: at what point does the unborn embryo/fetus gain the rights of a full grown person? There are two extremes:  1) The moment after conception.  2) The moment of birth.  My problem with number one is that a single celled organism shouldn't have rights that are equal to those of a person, and my problem with number two is that mere physical location (outside rather than inside the womb) shouldn't dictate whether we have rights, so I propose that the embryo/fetus gains rights over time as it develops. How early these rights are given is obviously something that is going to be debated, and, in my own opinion, should be debated because it will be a much more fruitful debate than the current ""all or nothing"" one that is all too common.

In my personal opinion, once the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb (which means society can theoretically take care of the baby without the mother's input) then society can intervene.

Are sperm, hair, skin, and spit also human beings in their own rights?  About ""thinking, feeling, seeing and hearing"" -- you conceded that an fetus slated for abortion is not capable of doing these things in your post above.  ""By your logic . . . if they can't think, feel, see, hear, or remember than by all means, kill em.""  So this new argument that ""Silent Scream"" contradicts your earlier premise that the fetus does NOT ""think, feel, see, or hear"" is simply logically inconsistent.

"Ok, so it's better to kill 1500 children a day than a handful of women periodically  DNA proves humanity, that's all  Um whoops, you took that out of context. Go back and read what I said. Notice how that quote starts.  by your logic  it doesn't say  by my logic

"But you posited the ""can't think, see, feel, etc."" You supplied that and you endorsed it by posting it. Notice how you did that. Can't get out by saying that your characterization was part of a criticism - it was still   your  characterization.  A clump of cells in utero is not a ""child."" That's why medical science has words like ""zygote"" and ""blastula"" and ""embryo"" and ""fetus.""  If you are asking for my personal opinion on abortion, which you seem to be, it is that abortion is a highly imperfect solution to a very real problem; but that until we have developed and agreed as a society to disseminate a completely 100% effective, safe, and pragmatic method of birth control complete with age-appropriate sex education AND eliminated rape and abuse or coercion of children, then the societal costs of limiting abortion access much further than it already is (and it IS limited; states can regulate it after the first trimester and can ban it completely once the fetus reaches viability, and can also determine which procedures will and will not be permitted) are simply too great. Rather than banning it, we need to be working towards making abortion pretty much unneccesary. This is much harder to do than simply banning it, but does have the advantage of actually solving the problems posed both by allowing and by prohibiting abortion rather than just ignoring them.

"I don’t care to debate nor discuss your convoluted justifications for destroying a human fetus or embryo. My question to you: Why did your mother not destroy you while you were nothing but a cellular glob?  Answer: Because your mother, and probably your father, loved you more than they loved themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hypocrite! You are ready to justify the killing of human fetuses, while at the same time ignorant of the fact that ‘your’ bullshit argument is possible by reason of your mother’s refusal to kill you while your were nothing but a cellular glob!   A female like you who is willing to justify the most cowardice of crimes against her own would-be progeny will commit any manner of crime against her own offspring. So, I think you should make certain that no cellular glob that is human in nature should ever be allowed to grow within your womb, for any child that is born of your matrix will most likely be sacrificed for your own selfish benefit.  This is no argument!! Why, because, you have confessed to the innocence of killing your own would-be progeny.   Down-vote all of my arguments! It still will not change the fact of your willingness to advocate not only the killing of all human fetuses (yes, all human fetuses), but the killing of your own would-be children.   Go ahead! Justify yourself, for your response is nothing more than a self-justification via the state agreeing with you that should kill your un-born progeny.   Oh, I can say much more about females such as you. Please, provoke me!  BTW, how many children have you given birth to?

"As I said, some debates have much stronger arguments to one side.   1 is not 4.    I agree. If both numbers refer to the same kind of thing, 1 is not 4. 1 banana is not 4 bananas. One could argue that, if it's not specified, 1 could be 4... For example, 1 family might have exactly 4 people in it. In this case, 1 (family) is 4 (people). But if the numbers are just shown without ""units"", it's usually implied that they are probably referring to the same thing. Therefore, 1 is not 4.   If you have your arguments in order, every issue is debatable. It's just that some are closer to a consensus than others...

The proposition is not an accounting statement. It is a proposition that asserts that 1 and 4 are not predicable of each other. In fact if that proposition is debatable then the law of mathematics is without a foundation.   Your arguments fail to debate the proposition, 1 is not 4 , but yet argues distinctly different propositions.

"I think that referring to mathematical rules as ""laws"" is the kind of misleading argument religious people like to use when implying that when using mathematics you require faith. Mathematics are not the ultimate truth about anything, neither should they be treated as unchangeable laws of the universe. Mathematics, as well as physics, chemistry, etc. are a set of tools invented by humans in order to explain phenomena we observe around us. We made sciences up, and it's up to us to upgrade them in order to improve our knowledge about the world.  Here I didn't go as far as to point a flaw in mathematics or something that should be changed, I actually agreed that in most cases 1 is not 4, and I know how useful that is in our daily life. My point is, we can and should question and debate everything, even the foundations of something which has been working for us all along, because we can never know when old explanations might fail us. This is specially valid for the question of abortion, since our old conceptions about when life begins might be wrong.  Anyways, if my semantic discussion of 1 not being 4 was not mathematical enough for you, here I got another one...   ""1 is not 4""   Wrong, this is not always the case. When dealing with binary numbers, when 1 is in the third number from the right, as in 100, 1 represents 4. In 111, 100, 10100, and so on, the third 1 is always 4 (as in the decimal system).

"I think you are misunderstanding what a logical proposition is. True, we can pretend to debate everything by use of fallacious thoughts, but when an argument is illogical nothing is debated.  However, in a sense we can irrationally argue everything! Agreed!  You have claimed that “all issues are debatable” while at the same time failing to support your proposition. The fallacious arguments you have submitted fail to refute my proposition and consequently indicate that only my proposition, i.e. not all issues are debatable, is axiomatic.   There is not one axiom you have affirmed that is evidence of your assertion, “All issues are debatable”.  The only logical and axiomatic proposition of  this debate  is simply: Some issues are debatable.

"The first question that needs to be asked is "" what kind of life is it?"" If it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate. Therefore no further questions are needed.

"So going back to abortion... you say that an illogical argument is not-debatable. So could you explain what is illogical about debating abortion?

It seems to me that you are just going around the issue without proving that killing a non-fully developed fetus is the same thing as killing a 3 year old child.

"The principle of pro-abortion: Human fetuses and embryos are sacrificial.   Welcome to a self-evident truth.  1. The pro-abortionists could dispute the words of the principle, but in doing such the pro-abortionist must necessarily contradict the pro-abortionist view.   2. The anti-abortionist has no reason to debate the principle because the truth of the principle is self evident.   Don’t make the mistake of thinking that anti-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born offspring. And furthermore, you will not be mistaken if you think pro-abortionists will sacrifice their un-born progeny for themselves.

I suggest you save some of that energy to debating the topic. So far, all i've heard in the hundreds of arguments against abortion is that ""it's a person, don't commit murder""... which has been rebutted many times.

"Ok let me clarify,But let me say I'm not sure why you are pushing this point, but my guess is that it has something to do with authority and you want to make a point about that.  So let me modify what I said; the reasons commonly given for abortions are in adequate.   In the case that the mothers life is endangered, it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child, Abortion should never be considered as an easy out, quick fix or money saving option, But if it comes down to it, I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else.   So even in this case I would still maintain that it should not be an option and I think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child's life should be taken and not the mothers. I think this maintains the sanctity of the child's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas. And the Husband and Wife should make the call, if circumstances necessitate it.

If not, you certainly will once you realize the terms ‘logical’ and ‘illogical’ are not predicable of emotions.)

"The question is not what makes us a person. The question is; what is it?  Genetics tells us that it is human, although in the early stages of development.

But in this day and age with 3D and 4D imagining it is simply naive.   But let's say your right and we don't know at what point the unborn embryo/fetus gains the rights of a full grown person. Why not err on the side of life? If we don't know it would seem wise to use caution and restraint. Therefore to allow abortion on demand would be the height of folly.

"Yes I do, because I think clarity is more important than agreement and I'm trying to be precise in my thinking. I don't find ambiguity or equivocation very helpful in debates. I ask the question because it is an ontological question and we need to know what it is that we are taking the life of. Asking the question of personhood doesn't get us very far because it is a characteristic of the thing in question just like the word fetus is. They tell us something about the thing but they don't tell us what the thing in question is. To know that requires an ontological question and that's why I ask; what is it? And you are correct, it is human although in the early developmental stage known as fetus just like you are at the stage known as adulthood, assuming your past puberty and if not you are an adolescent and yet still fully human just like a fetus is. And humans are the sort of things that have personhood; it's not what they are but a characteristic they posses.  Now I think the question, what is it, is one you would ask instinctively. What do I mean. Assuming you have a child, what would you say to that child if it came up behind you and asked; can I kill it? I'd bet money that the first question of your lips would be; what is it? And if it was the fly that's been bugging you, you would say yes and if it was the kid down the street you would say no. You see your answer hinges on the question; what is it and no other question. I hope you can see that. And the reason you would say no to killing the kid down down the street is because you know, instinctively, that humans aren't the sort of thing you just kill flippantly, it requires proper justification. That's why I oppose abortion. Killing humans for the sake of convenience is unjustified and evil.   BTW insult is not an argument, it's what you do when your position is unsound. You try and discredit your opponent to make yourself look good. But notice my character is unrelated to the question at hand, it has no bearing on it. That my friend is known as a genetic fallacy and an Ad hominem. You don't actually answer the question, you just obscure it and that's the opposite of clarity.

"Ad hominem? Nice one! I gave  lawnman  a load of ad hominems a little while ago as well! In my book, it's fully justified to discredit the character of the opposition if they prove themselves to be logically unsound and are showing obvious character weaknesses. By doing that, you're showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgements.  Now, I think I've read this story of the boy coming up to his father and asking ""can I kill it?""... why? It's because you've written it already in a different post! Recycling is acceptable when it comes to milk cartons, but i find it tedious here. Now I've already answered this but i'll gladly do it again: Killing a grown kid is murder! Why did society make a law to try and stop murders? Because society benefits from having its productive members alive and contributing! Now at the end of the day, morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species. Don't believe me? Thou shall not kill... thou shall not steal... thou shall honour thy parents... etc... all designed to foster a peaceful productive society with the end goal being survival of the human species.  Now, a kid has made it all the way through the whole process of fetal development, which is not easy to do because miscarriage statistics are quite high. That kid has earned its right to be a part of society. Killing that kid is wrong. A fetus on the other hand, can be created very easily and can also be lost just as easily too. The point here however is that the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct, so society hasn't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership. This is the way it should be. Maybe one day, we'll find ourselves in the position of an endangered species and guess what? I bet there'll be a law in every country that abortion is illegal! That's why societies make law. If it has nothing to do with the survival of society, society should stay out of it.

Now your free to use them if you like but they don’t carry much weight with me; I really am much worse than you think.   Now at the end of the day, morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species.   If that is true, then you are mistaken when you said  Killing a grown kid is murder  Because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society. But who decides what is good for the species, how do you define good, good for who?  But to my question ""can I kill it"" Your answer tells me that you instinctively know that there is something inherently wrong with murder and that it ought not be done. You recognize that there is something about murder that makes it wrong. And that wrongness is a characteristic of the act and not the peoples opinion of it. Gassing six million Jews was wrong even if the Germans thought it was good. You know that and so do I. But if that is the case then your premise of morals and righteousness being about survival of the species would be false because the wrongness of the act proceeds our perception of it and is independent of us. It is objectively wrong.   And further more how did it come to be that survival of the species was the good to be obtained? Because in your scheme it could have been otherwise. In your scheme it would appear to be that there really is no such thing as the good or the wrong. Because if your correct, like I’ve said, we could have just as well decided that killing grown kids is a good thing. But when we see kids butchered or any other injustice in the world something cries out within us that what we see is wrong. And we know it’s wrong because we know there is a good from which it deviates. And your definition of that good ( survival of the human species) is woefully inadequate to account for that kind of reaction. Because If you were to see someone gunned downed I seriously don't think you are saying to yourself; Hey, we as a society need that person you therefore shouldn't do that. No I think not, your gut reaction is; Whoa! that's not right...what the... We don't make laws to make things wrong, we make laws because we know that somethings are inherently wrong, they are wrong in and of themselves, like murder, theft and disrespecting people; especially our elders.   But what I think is more telling is the way you discriminate on the basis of level of development. Notice how you use the phrase “grown kid” So I ask you what’s the difference between a human in the womb and a human at the park? Level of development. The terms fetus and grown child describe the stages of development in the life of a human in this case. So when the life of a human is unjustly taken be it at 1 month after conception, 1 month after birth or 10 years of age it is wrong, that’s called moral clarity. That’s why the question “can I kill it” is so clarifying. It’s the last word, it, that makes all the difference. What is it, is an ontological question. I’m not asking the question, what’s its stage of development. That would be absurd to answer the question that way. You would never answer your kid that way. Hey daddy, can I kill it? Well son, how old is it, you know the younger the better. But that’s how you try and answer the question of abortion. I keep asking, what is it that we are killing? And you keep telling me how old it is, well it’s just at the fetus stage. OK, so what is it? And like I’ve said before; a question not properly answered doesn’t go away, it keeps getting asked. So I will keep asking the question, what is it? Till I get an adequate answer. But honestly you know as well as I do what it is and the only reason you would answer differently is if you were trying to justify something that you instinctively know to be wrong.      Final thought on showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgments. You said;  the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct, so society hasn't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership.   This statement from you destroys your whole argument. If this is true, why are there still laws against murder? And why are there hospitals? Why did the President just pass a massive health care reform bill? if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about? If our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions? It can't be survival of the human species, were doing that quite well. So what then is it if it's not survival of the human species? Maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong, maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it.

"Because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society.   We have executions. We execute murderers. These are actually not kids but adults. So we do kill people and I fully support it.  .   Gassing six million Jews was wrong even if the Germans thought it was good   Well, arbitrarily exterminating a race of people goes against human survival.   .   If you were to see someone gunned downed I seriously don't think you are saying to yourself; Hey, we as a society need that person you therefore shouldn't do that. No I think not, your gut reaction is; Whoa! that's not right...what the...   You're absolutely right. But you fail to see that our  gut reaction  is our subconsciousness and in its own language, it's saying ""hey, survival of the species is at stake here!""  .   Level of development   You're exceptionally thick, so I'm not hoping to get through to you at all. I'm simply hoping you'd one day wake up... How is a fetus not the same as person in the park? Well let's see... if the mother suffers a heavy fall or gets a bad virus, the fetus may well be naturally aborted and may no longer be, hell, sometimes it simply takes a little bit of stress felt by the mother for the fetus to be aborted naturally. A person in the park however, takes a hell of a lot more to end.  .   why are there still laws against murder? And why are there hospitals? Why did the President just pass a massive health care reform bill? if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about? If our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions? It can't be survival of the human species, were doing that quite well. So what then is it if it's not survival of the human species? Maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong, maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it.   Yes, human lives are valuable, but like I said, we're in no danger of extinction. All these measures such as laws against murder, hospitals, national health care, etc... are preliminary steps. Laws to mandate the saving of every possible human fetus would probably be the last thing to do... This may be necessary if something all of a sudden killed 90% of humans on Earth, for example.

"Thank you for making my point so well, you are correct. Taking human life requires proper justification. However waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justification. It's a unique human life and there is no way around that without ignoring the obvious. Declaring it to be something else and equivocating on terms may salve your conscience but it doesn't change the reality of what it is. It's reality is not dependent on you, it's determined by what it actually is.  If being thick and asleep keeps me from killing innocent humans in the early stages of development and makes me outraged at their slaughter than I'm guilty as charged and wear those names with honor

"waving a magic wand and declaring a human life only potential life or something else is not proper justification   It is proper justification for me and a lot of other people. Because with a potential life, we're not commiting murder. Like I said, we're stuck on the ""potential"" VS ""definite"" point.  .   If being thick and asleep keeps me from killing innocent humans in the early stages of development and makes me outraged at their slaughter than I'm guilty as charged and wear those names with honor   I hope you're a vegan as well. It would make sense, since eating meat would mean that you're ending lives. If you're a meat eater, you might say ""oh it's not human, so it's ok"" but others will say ""how dare you discriminate towards other species""... but you should be ok living with them hassling you because you hassle others pretty much the same way.

"Saying something is proper justification doesn't make it so. You first have to prove that it is and that you haven't done. You've only dismissed it's humanity. . If it is only a sperm or egg it is indeed alive but not fully human seeing it lacks the full chromosome set. But once it fertilizes and the chromosome set is complete; it's fully human. Either it's fully human and alive or it's not. I don't see any other option and the potential life argument doesn't factor in at all.  Again we are talking about the proper justification of taking human life; rabbit trails don't interest me.  About hassling; I will defend the innocent at my own expense; even if it cost my life because that's the right thing to do and it's always right to do what is right.

"Proof that aborting a fetus is proper justification of killing   It's potential life. There's nothing to prove. It doesn't have any rights.  .  No doubt you'll disagree and all I can say is that I respect your point of view. The question is: Would you be able to say the same?

"I've just responded to this notion of potential life so I will answer your questionin in regard to respecting your point of view.   Your are free to hold it. Although I disagree with it strongly I would never use the force of law or anything to prevent you from holding it and expressing it, that is true tolerance.   However, ideas have consequences and some ideas are deadly. So I would say that some ideas are vastly superior to others. What Mother Teresa did was a superior idea than what jihadist are doing. But jihadist are human and therefore are valuable human beings worthy of dignity and respect. So as humans I respect them but it's their ideas that I don't respect. So all that to say that I'm egalitarian regarding persons and an elitist regarding ideas. So as a human I will treat you with dignity and respect but I can't say I will do that with all your ideas, only the ones that are good by objective standards.

No one likes getting an abortion, and everyone would be happier if there were less abortions; however, in the very early stages when all there is, is a clump of cells, a woman should be able to choose whether she want sto conitinue with the pregancy.  In addition, we already have systems in place that grant increasing rights with age, so I don't see how this case is any different.

"Looking at the world in black and white with complete disregard for reality is intelectually lazy, and I'm not at all shy to say it. The world is complicated, and when you look at it through an uncompromising moralistic lense you end up oversimplifying problems and giving simplistic answers. Calling abortion murder is simplistic and misses the point of the debate. I am doing my best to discuss the issue as rationally as possible but when you make statements like  Well if I'm intellectually lazy because I can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong, than I'm guilty as charged  it makes it really difficult to continue.  Of course no one wants to get an abortion. Whether you believe it to be murder or not, it's still a sad event and you'd have to be heartless not to feel something. What I am arguing is that banning abortion is not the best way to reduce the suffering that unwanted pregancies causes. Instead we should concentrate on improving sex education, and helping increase the standard of living of the poor (a group that is disproportionately more likely to have unwanted pregancies and get abortions). I know this is difficult for you to understand on your moral high horse, but stop and consider that there might be more to the issue then the oversimplified version that has been hammered into your thick little skull since birth.  I'm sorry but a single cell's rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do not trump the right a woman to choose whether or not she wants to be a mother. We are talking about something that doesn't exist as a thinking feeling human being, and I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.   The most dangerous place in America shouldn't be a mother's womb   I agree, and that's why I said that a viable fetus should be considered a full human being, however you choose again and again to ignore this fact.
",1
"Looking at the world in black and white is called moral clarity. Somethings are obviously wrong like theft, rape and murder. To say otherwise would be foolish and be to deny the obvious. Now you may use your intellect to justify those acts but then your intellect becomes complicit in the act. Not a place I want to go.   Of course no one wants to get an abortion   If that were true no one would get an abortion. People get abortions because they want to.  In regards to ""feel something"" and ""the suffering that unwanted pregnancies causes"" You seem to miss the greater suffering and depression women feel after an abortion, a suffering that last a life time. That suffering is far greater than that of finding out you got pregnant. That's the suffering I want to end. Not to mention the trauma of the child which just lead Nebraska to ban abortions after 20 weeks. It's called The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   I don't understand why you can't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs.   Because it is wrong to base the value of another human on subjective terms like those. Adopting subjective standards makes it possible for the strong to exploit the weak and that's exactly what your standard does. You ought to be protecting the weak and innocent, not using your intellect to come up with ways to justify their killing. For example you said  a viable fetus should be considered a full human being . So those that are not, are not human? You've just stripped them of their objective humanity by your subjective definition of humanity and now you feel justified in killing them, I'm sorry but that's not proper justification. I do hope you can see how dangerous your point of view is because it puts even your life in danger if logically followed through. All I have to do is be more powerful than you and determine that your life is not viable by my standards and then I'm free to kill you; might makes right.   That's why abortion should be banned, because all human life is valuable by the fact that it is human. If we move the value from the objective to the subjective than no one is safe and we have turned the law on it's head because laws are meant to protect people. But who is a person is subject to the opinion of another. I don't know about you but I never would want to be treated like that.

"Yes, this type of stupid hypocracy must be banned!  The parents have right to kill themselves but not their growing babies.  Many countries face a crisis due to this. If the abortio is not a safe mode executed, then it can affect the parent's health too.  Friends, How can you accept the death of an innocent infant who never harmed you?
",0
"Friend, it has nothing to do with you unless you can keep it alive yourself. Before the fetus turns at least 20 weeks old, it has no chance of survival outside of the mother's womb. This means she alone should have the choice. You should not butt in just because of your own feelings. Consider other people's feelings, consider the people who are directly affected by this. They should have the choice to keep the pregnancy or not before it turns 20 weeks. If you can't keep it, then butt out! It's not an infant, it's merely a POTENTIAL life, which is in the same category as an egg or sperm on its own.

"Abortion should be legal. The government should never have the right to make decisions pertaining to one's own body and/or a decision to bring a child into the world or not. It takes the moral responsibility to do what is right away from the individual and this would cause us to become more and more conditioned to behave in whatever ways the establishment chooses to mold us. It would contradict the very core of what it means to be free.  If we make abortion illegal, shouldn't we also make adoption? In case you don't know, the business of adoption is in the billions per year. Making abortion illegal would bolster this industry even further, and allow desperate people to become ""baby merchants"", for profit. An example would be a girlfriend of mine who needed money and decided to sell her eggs. What moral ground does that hold? Not to mention the financial burden more children would put on the American people in light of high inflation and low wages, health care costs, education etc. Forcing you to keep a child could very well sink many families into poverty.   To me, the person undertaking an abortion has enough to deal with that they don't need my opinion on their moral character on top of it. They don't need my judgement because they're the ones having to live with that decision. And of course legal abortion would come with regulations to protect it from abuse. I think there's a lot that can be done to provide people the freedom of choice without allowing them to abuse that freedom, just like many other things in this country. If we make abortion illegal, adoption agencies might start to look like dog pounds.  I think we need to believe that the majority of people in this country, and around the world, are good people seeking nothing more than the best chance at living a healthy and happy life. We are not all predisposed to moral corruption, poor decision making and ignorance. If we want to prosper as a nation we have to believe in our fellow man and that he will do what's right, however, that faith will not come without regulations to protect the system from those of us that would abuse it.

"To your first point:  What you are arguing for is the view known in German as; Lebensunwertes Leben or The Life Unworthy of Life. This was the philosophy that drove the Holocaust of Nazi Germany and the one currently underway here in America. To learn more about this follow this link  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Life_unworthy_of_life    Why do I say this? Because you take a class of humans and then give reasons ( very poor ones) of why they should not be allowed to live.  In Nazi Germany they said; This human should not live because of X. And you say that this human should not live because of X. There is a direct correlation here and I hope you see it. When you get a chance also pick up the book   From Darwin to Hitler  by Dr. Richard Weikart  Now to your question of when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?  At the moment of conception. Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell. There is no way around this; humans produce humans and dogs produce dogs.   About a contraception that is 100% effective every time. It's known as abstinence. Practice it faithfully and you will never get pregnant or an STD. Fail to practice it and pay the price with your life and possibly that of your child's.   And if you do have an unwanted pregnancy, Please consider adoption. Did you know that 1 out of every 6 couples are infertile. Do the math, that's a lot of couples who want to have children and can't. And I'm one of them. It cost me 14,000 dollars to have my daughter and it tears me up inside to know that some parents just discard their children like trash. There are thousands of us out here who are screaming; please don't kill it, we'll take it. You'd also be surprised to know the high number of Americans who adopt from over seas; and why do they? There aren't enough children to be adopted here because of abortion.  You noted well that I see this issue as black and white. It's called moral clarity. When looking at evil I call it as it is; evil.   Final thought: Were you ever a fetus? Because if you were, Then you have to acknowledge that if your mother would have had an abortion it would have ended your life, not something else, but your life. Think about that and look at it real hard because that's what abortion does; it ends the life of a human being in the early stages of development.

Look at prohibition in the 20's and look at weed now. They were never gone, just made illegal. If abortion is illegal then someone who made a mistake in having sex, such as a teen, can't tell anyone about it for obvious reasons. The only person she tells is a best friend and she can't have the baby because the parents will find out so her only option is abortion. OH WAIT! Abortion is illegal so she has to go to some old lady in the trailer park or do it herself with a coat hangar, either way she will end up with a disease (that I can't remember the name). Abortion is wrong but should not be illegal.  Also, I really don't want to sound mean or offensive but this probably is: Abortion will help with population control. Our world's population is increasing faster than ever. we need to keep our resources. And the main people that want abortions are usually careless people or rape victims. Most families would either be able to take care of the child or be courteous enough to put the baby up for adoption.

Having sex risks pregnancy, everyone knows that, just like driving without wearing your seatbelt risks serious injury. You can risk it if you want, but when the unexpected result happens, you have a choice: You can decide if you WANT the pregnancy OR NOT. If you decide that you don't WANT the pregnancy, then the law kicks in!!!! A hefty fine is a very good deterent. You can build the cost of the fine into the cost of an abortion. This would make the cost of an abortion very very expensive. The proceeds from this could all go into funding educational programs about sex and pregnancy, counselling, etc... You can even build in a jail term for the guilty if you feel that monetary fines aren't enough.

It's a solution to a problem, which is unwanted pregnancies. It has more educational value then a ban on abortion. Hit people where the pocket is and help them avoid a mistake in the future, don't make them pay for their mistake by forcing them to bring up a child. Forcing someone to keep a pet against their will can have dire consequences for the animal concerned, you get my point?  The only reality check here is that a ban on abortion simply doesn't work.

"Goodbye.  And apply some energy to thinking about how to make your arguments more understandable and persuasive logically.

"The debate is not about whether or not abortion is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a pregnant woman carry a child to term. There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy. There are even more reasons a woman may choose to abort that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the woman and her doctor apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.  Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.  What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of abortions performed when there are better options? People like me who abhor abortion need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.

"You say;  There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.   I'd like to hear one.

Taking the life of another person is an injustice, destroys domestic tranquility, destroys general welfare and robs the individual of the blessings of liberty, If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?  This is how our Founding Fathers saw it:   ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness""  Please note the use of the word ""all"" The decision handed down in Roe vs Wade stripped a whole class of people their rights by denying their humanity.  This ruling goes against the very Constitution itself; It is a disgrace. As I said earlier it turns the law on it's head, the very law it is supposed to uphold.   It appears this court has become destructive of the purpose for which it was founded and according to the Deceleration of Independence it is our duty to do something about.

"I'd like to hear one.    about 2% (not an insignificant amount) of pregnancies are ectopic; ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the first trimester.   http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1101/ p1707.html

"What about pregnancies that are a result of rape? Inability to raise the child? Teenage pregnancy?

"There are various good reasons for terminating a pregnancy.   I'd like to hear one.   In some cases an abortion may be life saving to the pregnant woman. I don't think that a woman who chooses abortion to save her own life is committing an immoral act.   Taking the life of another person is an injustice   In general I agree that is true, but you yourself admit that sometimes it is justifiable to take a life DO YOU NOT?   If government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights what good is it?   I never said that ""government has no authority to protect an individuals unalienable rights"". Whatever just authority it does have is derived from the consent of the governed.  How far do we let government go ""protecting"" us. There are a million more laws I'm sure that can be shoved down our throats in the name of protection. Our right to privacy applies at some point, and I think health care decisions made in a doctor's office merit that privacy from government intrusion.

"That scenario of the endangered mother is rare. The vast majority of abortions are performed on healthy women and children. You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm.  The right to life is  the  most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue. When we as a people deny that right to a whole class of people we have undercut ourselves.  In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion. And just to be clear, an unjustified action is unjust. I'm convinced that an abortion is unjustified for the reasons commonly given.  In regards how far: I think the Constitution makes that clear, but Roe vs Wade undercuts that very Constitution.  This isn't a debate about some theoretically fetus somewhere. This is about the 1500 lives that are snuffed out daily in our land and it's about you and I because it affects you and I. Don't think laws like this can stand without serious ramifications.      Just consider that 1/3 of our population has been exterminated since Roe vs Wade. Do you think that has an affect on Social Security now that there are more people drawing from it than paying into it. What of the effects on health care? How many doctors and scientist were exterminated

"You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm.   maybe not based on, but exceptions to the norm should at times bear heavily during the legislative process.   The right to life is the most fundamental right, everything else stands or falls on this one issue.   So the argument is... that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors? If a teen girl was found pregnant she could be arrested for underage sex and could carry to term while incarcerated........ready to be made into a movie...jeez  I think that in a very real sense, the right to ""reproductive privacy"" precedes the ""right to life"". I would love to read a response to this particular point.   In regards the taking of life; I agree with you, but not when it comes to abortion.   Yes I understand you are a firm proponent of the death penalty....isn't it true?...oh right I remember the logic ""You don't make laws based on exceptions to the norm""  You don't have to convince me that high abortion rates represent the deepest poverty. I need to be convinced that government intervention (invasion to the privacy thereof) in doctor/pregnant woman relations is merited. Remember I think that the right to life depends on reproductive privacy.

"Let me address the point you are making here:   that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors?   If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion? And if I'm a doctor I have more of a right to do what I want? Don't you think this goes against one of the reasons for licensing doctors, public safety? Again I say; If a government has not right to protect life, what good is it.  On the issue of the death penalty. The principal in play for me on this issue and abortion is the same; the sanctity of human life.

"If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion?   It is true that laws enacted to protect privacy rights also provide opportunity for secret wrongdoing.  Jstantall, you agree that abortions are  sometimes  medically necessary correct me if I am wrong.  You think that a doctor/pregnant woman relationship should not be private but court monitored to make sure doctors don't commit murder. Again correct me if I am wrong.

"Very little of all abortions are performed because of the baby threatening the mother's life.  Even less abortions are performed because the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.  Most reasons are not enough money for a baby; partner/family does not want me to keep the baby.

"Taking the life of another person   . . . is not what happens in an abortion, because a fetus is not a ""person.""   Roe  didn't strip any class of ""people"" of rights, because a fetus is not a person.  Nothing about the abortion right is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a fetus is not a person.   Never  in the history of U.S. law has a fetus been a ""person,"" and a fetus is not a ""person"" under the law of the EU either.  Are you getting the part where you went wrong yet?

"The question is not about person-hood, but humanity and that is genetically verifiable. Answer the question, what kind of being is it? Everything else is superfluous.  And just so you know what side you stand on; your argument is similar to those who supported slavery,  they are not full persons and therefore have no rights under the law .  So let me qoute you using the word slavery in place of fetus and maybe you can see where you went wrong   Nothing about the right to slavery is unconstitutional, because (get ready for it): a slave is not a person.    Never in the history of U.S. law has a slave been a ""person,"" and a slave is not a ""person"" under the law of Britain either.  A slave is property and therefore one can do with it as one sees fit.

"FYI  The question is not who did or didn't do this or that. The question is should abortion be banned. I say it already is. We already have laws against murder; it's just that Roe vs Wade made a loop hole in the law and that ought to scare the hell out of any sane individual. Because with that ruling a whole class of people just became non persons and no longer protected under the Constitution.   Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong.

"Your argument fails in that a human who has been born, whether freed or enslaved, is a life in being -- i.e., someone who is an autonomous life fully developed to the point of not being physiologically dependent on another being for basic bodily functions. We recognize that autonomous, born human beings share certain basic rights. These rights do not extend to clumps of cells which are wholly dependent on another living being for their existence. Therefore your analogy does not actually equate at all.
",1
"A clump of cells is not what is aborted, do your research first. But let's say they are for the sake of the argument; what kind of cells are they? chicken? no they are human.  On the issue of dependency: you are wholly dependent on other living beings for your existence. By your logic it would be OK to kill you if the issue of dependency was all that was needed to justify your death. And further more we could extend this to the mentally and physically handicapped. It could apply to the sick and suffering, people with cancer and all those in hospitals. The logic you use is exactly the logic the Third Reich used when it began doing these very things; long before it got to exterminating 6 million Jews.  You may agree with the Third Reich that there is such thing as a life unworthy of life, but I don't. A child conceived is worthy of life and should have every opportunity to live it.
",0
"Your argument is specious. The sick and handicapped are not at issue. People with cancer are not at issue. None of them have hooked themselves up to the bodies of autonomous adults whose physiological functions are then used to regulate their own.  And of course, the first one to make an overblown comparison between the issue at hand and Nazism is inevitably the loser in any given debate.

"I'm questioning the underlying principle in play here and there is a connection between all the examples I gave. if you can't see the underlying principle here I don't know what to tell you.   The argument looks like this:  X is not worthy of life because of Y, therefore we're justified in killing it.  Now just put Jews, slaves, embryos or what ever in place of ""X"" and put your reason in place of ""Y"" and you've got your argument.  Can you see the analogy between them now? So my principal objection is with the ""Y"" when you have an embryo for ""X""

"Jews, slaves, etc. are all beings in their own right, not dependent on the womb of another. So no, your argument does not hold up.

"Notice what you have done; You've imposed an arbitrary standard (dependent on the womb of another) and then said it is OK to kill any human being who doesn't meet this standard. That standard can be slid anywhere up or down, from conception to old age. It's what is know as moral relativism and it's a morally bankrupt ethic. The question is not; at what point can we kill it, but what is  it ?  You need to first establish that this standard of yours is morally justified because I'm not persuaded that it is.
",0
"Old age? How's that work? No ""human being"" is going to be dependent on the womb of another for more than about 10 months. Once it's out of the womb, it is by definition no longer dependent on said womb for survival.  The standard is flexible, not arbitrary. It is flexible to a certain defined degree (as it should be) and that degree should, to my thinking, correspond to the level of prenatal physiological development. In other words, rights vest as the being grows and matures.

"All of us were once a fetus. That is a child. Obviously, none of you chose to watch the posted video, silent screams? Or how about the facts about a 10 week fetus.

"All of us were once a fetus.    Agree.   That is a child.   Disagree: unsupported leap in logic. The organism passes through varied stages of development between ""fertilized egg"" and ""child.""   Obviously, none of you chose to watch the posted video   Incorrect assertion. Watched it, multiple times, not in favor of outlawing abortion.   We are challenging the law. This is also our constitutional right.   Yup, that's your right, but since SCOTUS has already rejected ""it's a person it's a child"" not just once but many times, continuing to just assert ""it's a person it's a child"" while citing to a video from 25 years ago is probably not a very strong argument with which to challenge the law.

"The view of ""Abortion is the unjustified taking of a human life in the early stages of development and that is wrong"" is expected of a pro-lifer looking to force his/her belief on others.  Abortion is actually not unjustified. People have very good reasons to do it. It's not a fun activity, so to arrive at the decision people would have had to consider lots of options.   Abortion is also not the taking of a human life. It's the prevention of a human life, same as having sex with a condom, using the pills, abstinence, etc...  Finally, believe what you want, but don't force it on others. I respect pro-lifers' views, they should respect my views. What I do with my body doesn't affect the quality of their lives. Don't affect the quality of mine!

"Once the 20 week period has passed, the fetus has a small chance of surviving outside of the womb. Society can then decide if it wants to outlaw abortions after this period, when the baby can actually become a person independent of its mother.

"I'd like add a different perspective to your argument. I've changed one key word, tell me if it changes anything.   The debate is not about whether or not slavery is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a man may not have a slave. There are various good reasons for having slaves. There are even more reasons a man may choose to have a slave that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the buyer and seller apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.  Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.  What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of slaves traded when there are better options? People like me who abhor slavery need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.   Hope that clears things up for you.
",0
"Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thing. It's an entirely different debate.  A fetus that's not capable of survival without being directly attached to its mother via the umbilical cord is still not yet a person that merits society's involvement. It is the mother's property until this point and she must have the choice of keeping it or not. You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself. If you can keep the baby alive with milk then by all means take it out and do that if you want. The mother doesn't have to be involved any more.
",1
"Keeping slaves and aborting a fetus is not the same thing   Never said it was, only the logic behind it. Here is an example:   It is the mother's property   FYI that's the same logic that was used to justify the beating of slaves; it was the slave master's property.   You must not force someone to keep something alive within her because you can't do it yourself.     That's called discrimination on the basis of level of dependency. Should I discriminate against you because you are dependent on the local grocery store to get your milk? I think not, that would be wrong.  And finally, did you forget what we are talking about here? We are talking about a human being.

"The fetus  really  is the mother's property naturally (she created it and didn't have to buy it from anyone) , whereas the slave is bought or forced to be his/her owner's property. The 2 situations simply cannot be compared.  .   That's called discrimination on the basis of level of dependency.   No it's not. There's no  level .   The fetus is either  completely  dependent on its mother, or is  completely not  dependent. After a certain period of development, an incubator and some formula could totally replace its mother.  As for me and the local grocery store, I won't die if the local store refuses to serve me.  .   ...did you forget what we are talking about here? We are talking about a human being.   No, I agree that it's a potential human life. Not an actual life. The 2 things are not the same.

"Somebody flunked biology didn't they? No, I'm sure you didn't which tells me something else motivates your avoidance of the obvious.

"You keep saying that it's human, which I agree with you. The points of difference seems to be that I regard it as a  potential  up to a certain point, whereas you think of it more as a  definite . You then argue that it deserves all the same rights as that of people. I don't agree I'm afraid. It doesn't deserve the same rights and you can call this discrimination based on level of development ;) (not based on level of dependency as you keep saying). Until it passes a certain stage in its development (mental and physical), it shouldn't have any rights whatsoever.
",1
"Here is what I think you are saying by potential life; This human after a certain point can go on and have a life. And by life I'm guessing you mean it in the generic sense, meaning the totality of ones existence, a life lived.   Here is why I think that is a dangerous position to hold. Basing the value of a human on it's potential is a subjective value judgment, someone other than the human in question decides the value of the human life. If someone decides that the life of someone else is not valuable they then are free to dispose of it. That's dangerous because that is how Germany began the road to the holocaust. It started with the sick, mentally retarded and elderly. The did it by making the value judgment that certain humans didn't have potential, they held no value for society. And following Darwin's model of survival of the fittest it was only logical to dispose of them. See potential is a very vague and subjective term that can be defined in a multitude of different ways, it's what's know as an equivocal word.   You see when a value judgment is subjective the line between value and no value can be easily moved to suite the desire of the one with power making every human at risk, even you.   The safer ground to stand on is objective value. The value of the human is in the human itself. By the fact that it is human gives it it's value. This puts all humans on a level playing field. I can't come up to you and because I have more power than you say your life is not as valuable as mine. Taking the position of objective value protects the weakest and most vulnerable members of the human race. We are not free to exploit them because we are more powerful.   I hope you see that by making this subjective value judgment of another human being you have raised yourself above them because you are more powerful. And now because of your power over them you can kill them freely, this is nothing short of the exploitation of the weakest and most vulnerable humans. Conscience ought to tell you that we should protect them, not exploit them.

"That's right. It's inside the woman. It's a part of her body like any other organs inside her. Until it can survive outside her womb, it's her choice whether she wants to continue to allow it to develop into a human life. What happens after week 20 when theoretically it can survive outside her womb? Well then society, if it so chooses, can keep it alive and would have the right to intervene. Until then, society has no rights.

"Abortion is aw right that should be based solely on the woman's decision. There is no reason for abortion to be banned, and in fact, that is restricting the rights of women by not allowing them to have abortions. Also, think of those who have been raped and sexually abused and have no choice but to bear the child of a person who did such horrible things to them. An abortion is the only way to escape raising something that would always remind that person of something horrible in their life.

"So the woman's decision means killing a child, and that should be ok?  How is the fact that the child was conceived through rape, the childs fault? Would you treat this child different after it was born? So, why treat it any different before?

"No, wit does not mean killing a child. It means killing a zygote that has no conscious thought. Arguments against abortion use scare tactics like killing cute babies in their mother's arms.

Also, yes a child that was born because of a traumatic indecent such as rape would be treated differently. Also, what about the mother's career or in some cases the mother's education. Should that be ruined because of the inability for this escape.

Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual.

About killing a fetus, I know this may sound a little heartless to you but I'd still like to see you argue this properly: Why shouldn't we kill fetuses? We can make fetuses all the time (some people can't but this doesn't concern them), the human population in the world continue to grow and if overpopulated, we'd be in crisis mode because of food shortages and environmental destruction. We don't owe fetuses anything! If we want to have kids and give them a chance to contribute to society as well as carry on our genetic heritage then we can keep the fetuses, but if we don't want kids, we can just get rid of the fetuses, we don't need to consider if the fetuses have committed a crime or not, we don't need any excuse at all.

It's not the same as killing people. We're not in shortage of fetuses in the world.   Now, focus!

"I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.  Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception:   Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasn’t living so it wouldn’t matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasn’t living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldn’t even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being.   This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isn’t a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesn’t begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.  Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that they’re too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girl’s parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesn’t want to deal with the baby.   First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. That’s 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you can’t see or feel the baby inside of you, doesn’t mean it’s not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should.   There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isn’t it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mother’s womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.    Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law.   In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.  Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong. WORDS: 981

"Um, that doesnt prove anything except what it actually is. When a woman becomes pregnant she starts going through a hormonal change to adjust for this really huge thing that is about to happen to her life. It is natures way of preparing a woman for motherhood. When the baby is lost, through abortion, miscarriage, or accident, all women go back to normal hormones in a quick fashion and it causes depression.   If you think that a woman feeling guilty about the abortion isnt misplaced emotion then let me tell you a general story that I am sure relates to every woman on the planet.   When you get all emotional and upset because your bf or husband does not put the dishes in the right place or some other lame ass reason for getting upset, do you really think that that is really the issue? Is it really not your period or your mom not listening to you? Yes it is. So misunderstanding your emotions and where they stem from is how you define ""woman"".

"I would rather lose a handful of women occasionally through botched abortions than sacrifice on average 1500 children daily to save those women.    If perfection is your standard for law then you are correct, however laws were meant to restrain. And prior to Roe vs Wade the law against abortion did that quite well, perfection? No. Made it rare? most certainly. And what happened after Roe vs Wade? abortions went through the roof. Laws are meant to keep us from killing ourselves off but Roe vs Wade does the opposite. it sanctions it.   Consider Europe, within a hundred years, if not sooner, Europeans will cease to exist as a unique people group. Why? Zero Population growth. They're not reproducing and when they do, they kill it.

If the pregnancy would be damaging in any way to the mother, because it really is her choice, I believe abortion is appropriate. I AM NOT SAYING IT SHOULD BE USED AS BIRTH CONTROL. If you have more than one abortion because of your own stupid mistakes, then yes, you most definitely carry the baby to term and put it up for adoption.

"You can't get pregnant or contract an STD if your not having sex outside of marriage.   Well, that's totally goofy and wrong. Married women get pregnant all the time. (Oh and here's a total shocker: not all married women  want  to get pregnant.) And of course if your spouse has an STD and you have sex with your spouse, you can catch it.  Nor does abstinence ""provide 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy,"" since rape and child molestation do happen.  And finally, there are a great many ""questions when it comes to abortion"" -- including the safety and wellbeing of the woman, the privacy of family decisions, the right to bodily autonomy, the state's interest in the life and health of its citizens, the relative value that should be placed on the life of the developing being, and the stage of development at which such value should attach or be assessed -- just to name a few off the cuff.

"Actually, you can contract an STD not having sex outside of marriage.   Or, to avoid the double negative, having sex strictly with your spouse. It takes TWO people to make sex. So,  you  not having sex outside of marriage doesn't necessitate that he/she will as well.   It would require both parties abstain to attain the ""high sexual standards"" you propose setting. What are our current sexual standards by comparison?   As far as abortion goes, there are clearly differing opinions on when life begins. As such, let doctors inform the law on when defining characteristics appear, and let women make the choice on moral judgement.

"My point is you're forced to rely on your spouse having been a virgin prior to marriage as well. And you'll really only ever be 100% sure of your own sexual history. So really the only safe sex is to take a vow of abstinence. For life.   There is certainly question to when life begins. You say it's life throughout. What marks the beginning stage then? The question is  not  what kind of life. What does that even mean?   And of course it's not ok to kill your neighbor. Nice try. Your neighbor  is  a fully grown person, and does not live inside of you for 9 months. Considering that a fetus lives inside you (and if brought to term must be raised by you for 18 years), you have a little more say over it's existence. And, to paraphrase Obama, pregnant women tend to make the best choices on whether or not they are stable enough to raise children.   I agree that we should have better access to contraception. We can certainly both agree that we should minimize numbers of abortions as possible. And access to contraception would certainly cut down on abortions. Sexual education about contraception is also key. Abstinence only does not work.

"Abstinence prior to marriage (both parties) and fidelity within marriage is the safest sexual practice period. That's the ideal anything less than that is a degradation.  On the beginning of life; According to the text book definition of life both the egg and sperm are alive. At the point of conception you have a complete DNA and a different one from both parents. That's an accepted scientific fact that is not in question. The question is what kind of life? cat, dog or a chicken? Nope, humans produce humans.  About killing your neighbor; So long as he is not fully grown I can kill him? So, if it's the neighbors kid who I have been raising for the past nine months since his parents abandoned him; it's OK to kill him if I determine that I'm no longer stable enough to raise him? and even more so if I raised him for the last 18yrs? Yeah right. Try that in a court of law.  Why do you think we should reduce the number of abortions? Is it because you know in your heart of heart that it takes the life of a human being in the early stages of development?  We are drowning in a sea of condoms and sex ed and it has increased the rate of abortion, not decreased it. Abstinence has not been tried and found wanting, but found hard and left untried. Come on let's set high standards for ourselves and our kids, not low ones.

"It is a degradation to you, perhaps. Others believe differently. Why should we legislate based on your moral beliefs? Let's face it, unmarried people have impulses, desires, etc. They  are  going to act on it. Wouldn't you rather they have the tools to prevent pregnancy than not have them?   Perhaps I should have been more specific in my example. A baby grows inside of you. So technically, it is a part of you. A part of your body. You are not obliged to see it to term if you choose not to. This is why a ban on abortion would fail.   We should reduce the number of abortions because it's a very heartbreaking decision for a woman to come to. No woman comes to it lightly. When someone decides to end the life inside her, it is because she knows that it is a better choice than condemning the chiild to a lifetime of unhappiness. Some come to it because they know they cannot overcome an addiction and thus cannot bring a healthy child to term. Others because they know they cannot financially support the child. Others because they live in abusive homes that they don't want to subject a child to. Whatever the reason, it's certainly not an easy choice to make. So providing resources for these women such as education and contraception, can make a world of difference.   As for your last argument, what substantiates your claim?    From the University of California study on abstinence only and comprehensive sex education:     Behavior research cannot make judgments about social values, but it can evaluate the success of school-based curricula at producing tangible outcomes for young people. The weight of the evidence from peer-reviewed scientific journals clearly shows that some comprehensive sex education programs  can reduce behavior that puts young people at risk  of HIV, STIs and unintended pregnancy, and that these programs  do not promote earlier onset of sexual activity  or an increased number of sexual partners among adolescents.  By contrast, little if any credible research exists to substantiate the claims that abstinence-only programming leads to positive behavior change among youth.   The credible research sends a clear message to policy makers: if the goal of school-based sex education is to increase positive health outcomes for youth, comprehensive (or “abstinence- plus”) sex education is the proven effective choice. Abstinence-only programming runs the serious risk of leaving young people, especially those at elevated risk, uninformed and alienated.

"Your point on whether a child of 15 years is a human being or not is ridiculous.   We're talking about a fetus that can't survive outside the womb, we're talking about a potential life, not an actual life. A 15 year-old is a person so your ""what if"" is simply laughable.

"It's a degradation when it deviates from the purpose for which it was designed. A law should be based on what is right, not personal preference. I would prefer adults control their desires in order that society might function at its best. What if my desire wasn't sexual, let's say I have a strong desire to shoot people who make me mad. Should I act on it? You will say that hurts people and sex doesn't. Really, check out Ted Bundy's story sometime or the thousands of others like it. Consider child pornography, rape etc etc. Or maybe the sexual abuse of women doesn't bother you. Sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties. And if you disagree you are numb to it's effect. However, if you don't have sex you don't get pregnant. And you can't transmit sexually transmitted diseases without sexual contact. It's that simple.  About that baby, it's not a part of you. It has it's own unique DNA. It's not yours, so it's not you. It is a unique and separate human being that you happen to be hosting. That is the undisputed consensus.  about reducing the numbers of abortions: So if I make a heartbreaking decision after a heavy consideration to start killing all homeless people because they are sad, addicted, get beat up and we as a society can't support them anymore. It's OK because it was a hard decision? Yeah right, try that defense in a court of law. None of those reasons you give come close to proper justification for the taking of human life. A pregnancy is not the kids fault, but it is the parents responsibility. And kids should never get the death penalty because their parents don't want to take responsibility for them. The right thing to do is give them to someone who will.  Have you ever had any success with something that you decided from the start that it would never work. Trouble is there are more voices telling kids to have sex than not. Suppose it was the other way around, what do you think would happen to all these problems? Go away? No, but they might return to the levels they were at prior to the sexual revolution. Abstinence only worked well in this country for awhile to curb these problems. And perfection is never a requirement for law. it's meant to reduce the numbers. Slow our stampede into social anarchy if you will.

"Ah, now we get to the core of your argument. Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making? So basically, sex is not for pleasure, only for babies? Gay sex is wrong, then? Or sex between infertile married couples? Laws should be based on protecting other people, not on morality. Just like drugs, gambling, and prostitution ought to be legal, so long as those activities do not hurt others.   Your statement that ""sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties"" is laughable. Many people enjoy sex before marriage and find it to be an enriching part of their relationships. Just because you don't doesn't mean they are wrong. What effect am I numb to? Orgasm? Hardly.   ""It is a uniue and separate human being that you happen to be hosting""--like a parasite? So you should be able to choose whether or not to play host for 9 months.   Stop trying to relate my examples to murder. You and I both know the distinct differences between killing a group of cells that live within you and that you are ultimately responsible for and killing an independent person.   You claim that adoption is the ""only ethical choice"" for parents who are unable to care for their children, but this distinctly ignores two of the possible reasons I gave for abortion. 1-Addicts  cannot  bring a healthy child to term, 2-Abused women cannot hide a pregnancy and then give a child up for adoption. It also assumes that there would be enough of a ""market"" for adopted children if abortion were suddenly banned. Rates of children being given up would sky rocket, but would rates of parents wanting to adopt also rise?   Prohibition never works. Prohibition on alcohol didn't work. Prohibition on marijuana is not working. Prohibition on sex before marriage cannot and will not work. Prohibition fails. Period.  Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex"". We're providing sexual education so that if they make that choice, they will be informed on how to be healthy and responsible. I can't believe you'd rather have them NOT be informed, on the logic that if they DON'T know how to have responsible sex that they'll simply choose not to have it.   Did you bother reading the study I linked to? I'll reiterate the key points of their findings.  1-Comprehensive sex education DOES reduce rates of pregnancy and STD's, 2-Comprehensive sex education DOES NOT increase rates of teenage sexual activity, 3-Abstinence only education DOES NOT reduce rates of teenage sexual activity.    So, basically, the findings were that people are going to have sex, and try as you might, we can't dictate YOUR morality to them. Tricky thing about morals, they're all relative. If people are going to have sex, and IF abstinence only education has been proven to be ineffective at reducing rates of sex or pregnancy or STD's, then why would we continue to stick to it? To appease your moral beliefs? Again, laws are not, contrary to your belief, about morals. They are about people. And so long as sex is consensual, nobody needs protecting from it. Except perhaps you, since you so obviously find offense in the act of love.   I suggest this. Teach YOUR children your moral beliefs regarding sex. But for the sake of society, let's teach all children (including yours) what it means to be responsible with regards to sex. Just in case they fall off the high bar you've set for them. Wouldn't you rather they fall without HIV? Or an unwanted pregnancy?

"Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making?    I never said it's sole purpose was procreation. The core question is one of anthropology; does man have a nature and is that nature fixed? You would apparently say no and that man gets to define that nature. Laws should be based on ethics, not morality. However if mans nature is not fixed there can't be law or morality. Because there is no way man ought to be and no norm from which to deviate from. Everything becomes a matter of personal preference and taste. Everyone does what is right in their own eyes. That is anarchy and society crumbles.  Second paragraph: Never said there was no pleasure in it; just that their was a cost that is hidden from your eyes. I could never get you to drink poison if I was upfront about the effects. But if I kept that information from you and packaged it good enough; it wouldn't be hard Case in point; homosexuality. harmless? The average life expectancy for a gay male is 45yrs almost half of heterosexual males. There really needs to be more truth in advertising for the sexual revolution. It has brought freedom to no one; only bondage.  Third paragraph: We get back to the real question don't we? What is it ? If it's not human than no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is sufficient. About the choice, you made it when you decided to have sex. That troublesome problem of procreation again.  Fourth paragraph; there is that question again; what is it? just a group of cells or a human being in the early stages of life. If it's human, it's murder. hence the parallel.  Fifth paragraph: The examples you give represent a very, very small percentage of abortions. The vast majority of abortions are preformed on healthy women and children. About adoption; me and my spouse are an infertile couple, we looked into adoption and guess what? there are long waiting list for domestic adoption simply because there are more couples than children due to the fact that over 1500 abortions are performed daily in this country. that's why most couples adopt from overseas.  Sixth paragraph. If perfection is your standard then yes prohibition doesn't work. Prohibition does work, that's what every law is, a prohibition. It's sounds like you are arguing again for anarchy. To that I say; truth in advertising please.  Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex""  Really, you just substantiated my previous claim to being numb. Sex is used to sell everything these days. Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.  About the choice and sex ed. I'd rather we told the kids the true cost of premarital sex. instead of lie to them. Oh yeah little Johny you can play with fire, just follow these simple steps and you'll be just fine and hey here is some firecrackers to make it more fun. Now let me show you how to make a really cool fire using gasoline. Come on! Let's help kids choose what is best for them, and it's not broken hearts, STDs, single motherhood and the whole list of other stuff that goes along with it. About the parallel with fire, in case you didn't know, passion burns. A fire not contained can destroy a whole forest. Don't believe me. Watch the interview Dr. Dobson did with Ted Bundy the night before his execution. I'll quote it for you from memory because it's burned in there:  Dr Dobson: Ted, you once were an innocent little boy. How did you get here?  Ted Bundy: Pornography. I was exposed to it as little boy and it became a passion that was never satisfied. The more I got the more wanted till I was killing women to get it. Just ask any man here who is here on sexual charges and he'll tell you the same thing.  About the study; I don't dispute it. Of course it's failing that's my point. It's only logical that it would if you have a million people shouting, have sex and one small voice whispering, abstain. I doubt you did your homework and looked at the numbers for teen pregnancy and STDs before and after the sexual revolution.  Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple.  Final thought; if morals are relative as you claim, why are you trying to push yours on me and why should I follow yours and not mine. Is it because you think there is an objective standard that people ought to follow and a way things ought to be. But that's just your personal preference isn't. If you really believed that morality was subjective you would go sit under a tree and talk to no one, but you don't. You try and persuade people that your view is the correct one, but why I ask?

"So what then, is the ""the purpose for which it was designed"" if not procreation? Pleasure?! Say it's not so!   I would say man has a nature and that it is fixed. And it is for this reason that I strongly believe in not banning abortions and I strongly believe that abstinence only education should be replaced by comprehensive sexual education. Because part of that fixed nature of man is that each of us has impulses and desires of a sexual nature. (And those impulses and desires are not wrong.) Acting upon them is not a matter of ethics or morality. I've never understood how sexual activity came under the morality umbrella to begin with. So long as it is consensual, there's no justification. We don't analyze other types of activity for their moral fiber. Do we talk about the morality of football? The morality of swimming? The morality of sleeping?   Laws, as I stated earlier, should be based on the good of society, namely not causing harm to other people, while protecting each person's individual rights to do all things that do not cause harm to others. Ethics are not fixed, else we would all have identical ethical standards. How do you account for the differences if there is to be but one ideal?   LoL at the sexual revolution bringing bondage. How is safe sex prior to marriage harmful to both parties, though? If you're responsible, no transmission of STD's, no unwanted pregnancies, what is the damage you speak of? As for the life expectancy of a gay man, consider this: homosexuals are 26 times more likely to die from suicide and 87 times more likely to die from murder than heterosexuals. Which says a lot about more about tolerance than it does about lifestyle. Nonetheless, your argument is moot anyway, because homosexuals do not choose to be homosexual. That's not a lifestyle choice, so it cannot be right or wrong.   Would you say when you make a choice to walk barefoot you are also making the choice to host a ringworm inside of you? It's something that could be a consequence of that choice, but it's not a choice you've made. It's an effect. Similarly, impregnation is an effect of sex. Not a choice in and of itself. The choice ought to come prior to impregnation, when one can choose to prevent it through contraception. But sometimes it comes after. Nonetheless, it's up to the individual to make that choice.   The examples I gave represent the reasons abortion ought to be accessible. I agree that it should not be used as birth control. I agree that we ought to reduce the number. I believe comprehensive sexual education with access to contraception is the best way to achieve that. You seem to think that just telling them not to do it and crossing our fingers is best. It's just...jaded. There are about 150,000 children up for adoption per year. I'm not sure how many adoptive couples. My point is, would adoptive couples be able to keep demand up for that many unwanted children were we to abolish abortion today?   Again, let me specify. When I say ""prohibition doesn't work"" I mean prohibition of things that people recognize to be false laws. These would be laws regarding our bodies. Laws that tell us how we can use them (sex) and what we can put in them (drugs) do not work. People recognize the invalidity of these laws because they understand their bodies are ultimately theirs to do with what they please.    Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.   Holy cow you've got to be joking! Victimizes women?! Let me start a new debate for this alone. Please visit it at  http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                        Do_magazines_victimize_women    I'm all for teaching kids what's best for them. And what's best for them are the tools to make the best decisions for themselves. And those decisions, like it or not, are ultimately up to them to make. It's naiive to believe that all it will take is a strong voice repetitively shouting the abstinence mantra in order to keep people from having premarital sex.    Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple.  And this is a fine way to teach sexual education. I'm not against an abstinent-leaning program, but one that does not promote healthy sexual habits at all is dangerous. We've got to take into account those who will fail to abstain. Not doing so is heartless.   As far as the Ted Bundy bit goes, I really see no bearing here. That's specifically regarding pornography, which I'd be glad to debate the merits of in another debate.   Final thought:  Morals are relative, which is all I'm trying to push on you. My only ""push"" is that you  not  push legislation on others based solely on  your  moral beliefs.

"Well we've covered a lot of ground. Let me see if I can tie it all together for you; knowing that there is a difference between proof and persuasion.  What do abortion, premarital sex, homosexuality, pornography(including soft porn, the kind found in supermarket checkout lanes) and Ted Bundy all have in common? What is the one unifying thread that ties them all together? They all devalue human life by reducing it to something less than what it is. You agree that man has a nature and it is fixed. Therefore there is a way in which mankind ought to function. A deviation from that norm is therefore dehumanizing. Let me explain.  Abortion; Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.  Premarital sex: views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.  Homosexuality: An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.   Pornography: The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.     Soft porn: does the same as pornography but in a more subtle form; very deceiving since it appears harmless.  Ted Bundy; Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .   Do you see the pattern. reduce the person to an object to be used, use the person and then discard them. At the core of everyone of these is love of self. Use other people to get what I want and when I'm done with them I move on.  Does the idea of using people like objects bother you at all? It does me. That's why I oppose all these things.  Final thoughts:  football does have morality as do all sports, it's called the rules of the game. There's a way you play that makes it football and a way that makes it no longer football.  Pragmatism is is a poor method for law since it has no way of telling what the good is. Also do a word study on the etymology of the word ethic and tell me what you come up with. Because I may be mistaken but I thought ethics (ethos) were fixed standards and morality (mores)were changing standards.  Giving ones self over to passion is to be ruled by passion and no longer reason; that's bondage to be controlled by your emotions and not your mind.   If homosexuals don't choose to be that way, why then can so many walk away from that lifestyle and never go back. Their high suicide rate is because of people like you who tell them they can't change when they really want to. That leads to depression and eventually suicide. That's not a very loving thing to do.  On moral relativism; if that's true then it's just your personal preference and why should I like what you do.   About legislation: what else do you base law on other than what you believe to be right. But why is it OK to base them on your morals and not mine?  I think the state should remain neutral on sex ed. After all it is the parents responsibility, not the states. Because when the state does it, they are pushing their morality on others who don't agree with it and using my money to do it. And that is wrong.  About Abortion legislation, which this debate is all about. The state has already ruled on this issue, murder is illegal and should be. Roe vs Wade simply stripped a whole class of people protection under that law and denied them rights we all enjoy.   So again the question on abortion is; what is it? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is adequate.   So I say, it ain't a chicken. Humans produce humans. Therefore no reason you gave for abortion is adequate.  Also I like the idea of your debate; I'll be sure to weigh in on it when I get a chance.

"Abortion: Gives a mother a choice in carrying a life form for 9 months and then raising it for the rest of her life.  Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.  It cannot be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it. Only within a set time frame during which it has not become a person.   Premarital sex: Sex that occurs before marriage.  views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.  Generally I think of premarital sex as occurring within a relationship. If you're talking about casual, random sex, then your argument may hold some weight. But in the context of a relationship, there is a lot more at stake than personal pleasure via sex.   Homosexuality: Sexual desire for those of the same sex.  An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.   Wait....whaT? Where exactly are you getting this?   Pornography: Sexual media that satisfies urges of those who cannot get laid as often as they'd like.  The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them.  Hustler is viewed as an object for personal pleasure to be discarded. Not the people themselves.   Soft porn: Sexy people doing sexy things  Ted Bundy: Serial killer  Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .   Turned to violent sexuality (more often detective books portraying sexual violence than pornography) after an inability to relate to humanity.   I'm skipping around on your other arguments because I'm not in the mood for an essay, so bear with me.   Find me the ""so many"" homosexuals who can walk away from the lifestyle and never go back and I'll find you a group of people who have lied to themselves to make society happy.   Laws should be based on the good of society, not on your morals.   About sex ed, you're naive if you think we can leave it to the hands of the parents. You may be a responsible parent who plans to teach your children about sex, but many are not. We owe a responsibility to every child to give them the tools necessary to make the right choices when the time comes. Whether that's abstention or contraception, only they can make that choice.   Alas, I think I'm a little spent on this topic. I've had this in my argument activity for weeks but I've been reluctant to write back because it's gone all over the place. If you want to debate any of the non-abortion arguments we've been discussing, let's create a new debate, because this long argument full of fifty mini-arguments is just confusing.

"Ok, the central theme thing is completely unfair, considering you were the one who originally argued about porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like. I merely countered your argument. So in reality  your  central theme seems to be sex.   I won't disagree with your argument entirely. There are certainly a number of drawbacks to the sexual revolution. Namely in terms of the feminist revolution. We've taken a number of steps backwards in some inane desire to please men. The ""playboy effect"" is a very negative behavior that has resulted from the sexual revolution.   This does not mean that the sexual revolution was all bad or that sex outside of marriage is bad.   It's quite a jump to say that sex is only ok in a lifelong heterosexual marriage except for religious reasons. From a religious context, sure, it makes perfect sense, but outside of that it does not. For one, ""lifelong"" partnerships sometimes don't last a lifetime. For another, people are biologically programmed to sexual desires. Sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship, and I stand by my statement that there is nothing wrong with that.   Furthermore, you entirely ignored my desire to quit debating non-abortion related issues within this debate. If you'd like to debate some other topic, let's start a new debate. (please and thank you)

"Babies can be seen silently screaming during an abortion. What does that tell you?
",0
"OK I agree about a new debate; any ideas?  I do think I need to clarify something however and then I'll leave it at that.  Sex with in the context of a lifelong heterosexual marriage is the ideal and proper function of sex. Any form of sexuality outside of that is dysfunctional and causes problems. As with anything when it is not used properly.  I raised the issues of porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like as case studies of this principle. All of these are sexual expression outside of the proper context of sex and all of them cause problems; hence why I would classify them as dysfunctions.  What does all this have to do with the abortion question? The fact that there is such a thing as this debate about abortion proves there is a problem. No problem, no debate. So here is the problem as I see it. Married couples don't have abortions. So who does then? those expressing themselves sexually outside the context of marriage. If this causes a problem (abortion) than we must say something is dysfunctional or unhealthy. We can't say it is the sexual act because that alone doesn't always cause problems. It has to be the context in which it occurs. Because sexual expression in one way is without problems and in another it causes problems. Or to put it another way; one is a healthy expression and the other is unhealthy.   So to sum it all up; You will know whether something is healthy or dysfunctional by the fruit it produces. All the examples I gave including abortion are symptomatic (the fruit) of an underlying problem; sex outside it's proper context.   But this does highlight a problem we in our culture suffer from. We have forgotten the principle of sowing and reaping. When you plant a tree you don't immediately get fruit, it takes time. So if we do something and don't immediately see bad results that doesn't mean there won't be any. It may take years before are actions bear fruit.  So I hope you can see that I'm still debating the same issue. I'm going after the cause and not the symptom however. I also have been careful not to argue from religious reasons, although my convictions inform my reasons.   So I would agree with you that people are biologically programmed to sexual desires and that sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship. But I would say, judging by the fruit, that there is a healthy and unhealthy expression of that sexuality. Maybe we could debate whether or not sex outside of marriage is unhealthy by looking at the fruit it produces.

"Actually, depending on what is allowed in ""abstinence"", it may not. Oral sex, for instance, can transmit STD's, and many abstinent teens turn to oral sex as a way to satisfy their sexual desires.   I'm arguing that sexual desires are natural. It's easy to succumb to those desires and so abstinence-only education is weak. It ignores the fact that some people will CHOOSE not to remain abstinent. And that these people deserve facts on having safe sex. And furthermore, that if we made contraception more widely available to those who choose not to be abstinent, we can drastically cut down on the numbers of abortions.
",1
"Abstinence means to abstain. You can't get pregnant if you're not having sex and STDs are called that because they are sexually transmitted; no sex, no transmission.  About desire, we all got them and we all have an assortment of them. The difference between children and adults is that adults learn to control them. Children act on every desire; if adults did that, society would not be possible. So what I hear you saying is that we should never grow up. Hey kids will be kids, right? Come on. Let's raise the bar and actually expect kids to grow up.  Also, giving condoms is giving permission. You may be self deluded, but the kids get the message loud and clear. Sex outside of marriage goes through the roof with this approach and so does all the other problems associated with it. What I hear you saying is that it's best to create 100 problems to solve 1 problem. I'm sorry but that's what I call moral confusion.  Final thought, Kids rise to the occasion when you challenge them. Yes, some will fail. But better to loose a 100 than 10000. And the converse is also true. Set a low standard and kids will meet it. That's because they are looking to adults for guidance. So, lets expect more out of kids and not less.

And Death is as much a part of Life as Light and Dark, or Good and Evil. Death can't be avoided.   What you're talking about is a POSSIBLE contribution to society on earth if the fetus be allowed to mature into a person. But we've already argued this point of POSSIBILITY to death (excuse the pun): a fetus Could turn out to be worse than Hitler or the Devil itself... but you love talking about possibilities don't you?

"This is a speech that i found:  On behalf of the Salt & Light team, I would like to speak to you about a subject that is near and dear to our hearts. Today is National Sanctity of Human Life day. Perhaps you have noticed the pro-life sign in front of our church. If not, I invite you to look at it after the service this morning.  Thirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court made up a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Since then there have been 44 million abortions. There have been 112 million births. Using those two numbers, one can calculate that 28 percent of all pregnancies have ended in abortion. Everyday the number of babies killed by abortionists approximately equals the 3,000 killed by terrorists on September 11, 2001.  Now I believe that I do not have to convince anyone here in this church about the evilness and tragedy of abortion. But, if anyone remains unconvinced, go over to our nursery, pick up a little baby, hold it in your arms and gaze into its eyes and you will know the truth. All the pro-choice pro-abortion rhetoric will just melt away.  The real question to be asked is why, in this predominately-Christian nation, do we tolerate this practice? I have spent three years trying to answer that question. I must tell you that I am totally amazed. There really should be no debate at all about abortion. The truth should be clear to everyone. It should be a slam-dunk that abortion should not be tolerated. It should not be legalized. And it should not be a choice. After studying this issue, I now understand how Adolf Hitler was able to pull off the holocaust. It took a tremendous amount of propaganda, lies, and deceit. The Nazis were able to morally confuse many people. It took many good Christians in Germany closing their eyes and remaining silent.  Well the same thing is true today in the United States of America. There are a relatively few passionate activists who loudly spread pro-choice pro-abortion propaganda, lies, and deceit. They are able to morally confuse many people in our country. It is a sad truth that most Christians in all denominations have closed their eyes and have remained silent.  The abortion struggle has corrupted our politics. Legalized abortion is so entrenched in our government because one of our two major political parties has embraced it. To even be considered a viable candidate in that party one must blindly accept the doctrine of legalized abortion. This has made it difficult for the Christians who are traditionally members of that party. Every election cycle, pro-choice candidates try to give Christians reasons to vote for them on other issues. And so, too many Christians forget about abortion as they go vote. They often provide the margin of victory for pro-choice pro-abortion candidates. If a miracle were to happen and those Christians were to hold a little baby in their arms and gaze into his or her eyes just before stepping into the voting booth, our system of abortion would disappear after the very next election.  In conclusion, the most important thing I have learned during these last three years is that the future of abortion is totally in the hands of Christians. We really do have the political power to solve this problem. Our cultural enemies know this and they are scared. They desperately work to demonize and marginalize us. We do not have to convince the sinful pro-choice activists that they are wrong about abortion. We do not have to convince the radical feminists, the biased news media, or the morally corrupt politicians. To win, all we have to do is convince our fellow Christians to truly follow Christ and there is no doubt that they will vote pro-life.

"If a woman/girl is in danger of dying from having a baby, and was either raped or unaware of the fact that she was having sex (because they have never been educated), then they should have the right to not get physically hurt from having the baby or waste 9 months of their life, having to take time off from work to care for a baby she will give up anyway–if it even survives. If she doesn't die from having the baby, she will still be in a position of a weaker person. She will be less fit, and might even lose her job because she had to take a maternity leave.  My mother was 26 when she got pregnant with her first child. My father and she were very happy–until 4 months in when she found out that her baby, who she had already named Sarah, had a severe heart condition, where even if it did survive past birth (less than 1% chance), would have serious handicaps its entire life. Is it fair to cause Sarah to feel complete pain and suffering her entire life? At least with the abortion that my mother got, Sarah could feel no pain. She wanted that baby more than anything or anyone else in the world, and her heart was broken that she could not deliver the joy to Sarah that Sarah had first given to her. For three years my mother did not try to have a baby again, and those three years were the hardest of her life.  I agree that it's horrible for a woman to abort a child because they can't afford it, or don't want it, in those cases they should put the baby up for adoption. But if the baby or the woman is in extreme danger, then the woman has the right to choose. If you honestly think that it could be legalized for rape, but not for anything else, then how would you judge if it were rape or not? Even if the person could get consent from a judge, by then the baby would be even closer to being born and have more nerves that could feel the pain. Abortion must be either legal or illegal, and it is unfair to cause people like my mother to have even more emotional suffering. So I cast my vote for abortion being legal.  P.S. I may only be a 14 year old boy, but I have extensive knowledge on political fronts and current events, and my education thus far has been one of the best available to a public school. It has also been scientifically proven that children on average can see the correct answers to problems more easily than adults if given the same amount of knowledge because they have less emotional backgrounds that will impair their logic.

"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)

"Abortion is murder. Everyone has the right to live .

"Though i don't think i would be able to get an abortion because i hate big medical procedures i don't see why other people shouldn't or can't. There is not a limit on how many children a women can have, meaning if a women gets an abortion that is not one less child she can have on the future. Most only want 2 or 3 she can still have those 2 or 3 children. At the stage of pregnancy when abortions happen the baby obviously wouldnt be able to live if it was taken out of the womb that early, so is it really considered alive in the womb even if it has a heartbeat. It isn't until the 6th or 7th month that baby might have a chance of surviving if it is taken out early. People say that if it was a mistake you should have been more careful and should deal with it. But if there is a way to fix it it why is it bad? Abortion is in no way an easy route there are consequences and it is punishment enough for a mistake. And if the baby was formed without the mothers consent she whould be able to get rid of it as to not be reminded of the forced father.

"great ._.  1. Who's worried about trees? It just doesn't make sense to cut all of them down without planting new ones, since then all humans would die, born or not.  2. Um, kids are self-aware, they just don't develop  empathy  until sometime after birth. But a new born has feelings, knows when it's hungry, etc. Therefore it's wrong to throw them in dumpsters.  3. True, and it's state to state. But even the states that do allow it up to birth, again it is only in extreme circumstances. If I'm a woman in  any  state and I'm due in a week, and my life is not in danger, and I'm not a child myself and I wasn't raped by my dad or something, then abortion is not an option.

"1. The argument I was trying to make is that the Left seems to be more concerned about saving trees than they are HUMAN BEINGS. Thats another ""debate"" I guess.  2. OK not an argument here but I would appreciate some clarification...is it empathy or self awareness we are waiting for before we call them human? The reason I am asking is because it was my experience with my son that he almost immediately could sense his mothers emotional state and reacted in kind. He recognized both my wife's and my voice and music that he heard while in the womb.  3. I somewhat agree on this one in that if the birth risks the life of both the mother and the baby then there is no choice. I will admit I would anguish over a decision like that for the rest of my life.  As far as rape goes...while it is certainly not the fault of the mother that it happened to her it is also not the fault of the child.  4. I understand that but remember ""when your enemy makes you angry ...they win"" Someone really smart and famous said that but for the life of me I cant recall who.

"1. The left is generally anti-war, pro healthcare, pro helping starving people in Africa, etc, all of which saves lives. Since I don't consider a fetus a life, from my standpoint the right is more concerned with vague moral standards only shared by the right than saving lives, but whatever.  2. I'm talking about self-awareness, as in feelings. A fetus before the third trimester has 0 capacity to feel. They're not sad about being aborted, it doesn't hurt them, they don't have these human emotions yet. This is what I'm talking about. That an already born child likes its mom in no way invalidates this point.  3. And here is the disconnect, you are absolutely correct. But the leap so many on the right are not willing to make is that abortion is  always  something to anguish over. Sure, there are bitches (and I don't use that term lightly) who simply don't care. But the vast vast vast majority of abortions are performed by women who feel they simply have no choice. It is  not  a party. But it's  their  choice, something  they  have to live with. Not the right wing, not you personally, just her, no one else's business. The only thing making abortions illegal would change is the number of mothers who die with the child. That's all it changes no matter how pretty this anti-abortion idea that ""if we just shove what we really really really feel down everyone's throat everyone will live happily ever after, amen"" - that's not how it works. Woman have been having abortions one way or another, legal or illegal, since the beginning of time.  As for your point about rape. It's not the fault of the ""child"" only because the ""child"" doesn't exist. It's a cluster of cells and if she wants to abort it it's her choice, again, not yours.  4. facts and logic never vary. People are wrong about facts and logic, but in and of themselves, they are constant. It is a  fact  the earth is round for example. Some have the ""opinion"" it is not, but this is not an opinion, this is simply wrong. There is a fact at the bottom of when a fetus becomes self-aware, people who study biology for a decade before becoming a doctor believe this to be around the 3rd trimester. Whatever the answer really is, I trust the dude who studied it for a decade over people who think they speak in tongues and give their live savings to Jerry Falwell. Is the exact moment as definite as the shape of the earth? No, probably not. But it's not  that  big a mystery, and while a valid opinion may vary by a month or so of when this elusive self-awareness begins, it most certainly is  not  upon conception, or even 2 or 3 months later. It's akin at that point to saying the earth has to be flat because when I stand on my roof I can't see it curve.  Here's the difference between an argument with two different opinions, and the abortion debate.  Indulge me, I enjoy coming up with analogies.  2 people are walking through a forest. 1 wants to go left, the other right. The one who wants to go right says they both have to go right. The one who wants to go left says his friend can go right if he likes, but for himself, he thinks he should be able to choose.  That's the gist of it. It's not a matter of two sides fighting about what everyone should do. It's about one side trying to force everyone to do something they may or may not want to and the other saying since we really don't know where either leads, people should have the choice.

"I'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion.  First, the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions. This reality has weighed heavily on my conscience. But I think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it. The greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also.  The holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is. It has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad; and actually justifiable. So my effort is to make that know as best I can. But the truth is that when women, who have had abortions, come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt; and that certainly is not to be dismissed. So for those who have had abortions I say there is a way out of the pain and quilt; true forgiveness is possible. There is only one way out and that is through the great exchange; God in Christ takes your life and He gives you His. When He died, you died and the charges against you are paid in full, the debt is canceled. Then the life of perfection He lived becomes yours; it is laid to your account. So you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness. And through His resurrection you are raised to newness of life.  This is only possible through repentance and faith. Confess your sins and trust God to do for you what he said He would in Christ. This faith is not a leap in the dark, like crossing your fingers. It is an active trust, like standing on solid ground; a confident expectation in the faithfulness of God.  With that said I would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the question  should abortion be banned . But let me preface my argument with a disclaimer. I realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion. There is no argument that I can put forth that can't be disputed. There are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles. So I put this argument forth for those who are truly open-minded; in hopes you will be persuaded.   The taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal.    Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification. therefore it is murder and should be illegal

"Until at least week 20 of its development, the fetus has not been proven to be able to survive outside of the mother's womb. Since society can't keep it alive, it's the mother's choice.

"During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people. That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?  The subject of abortion and the Holocaust are very closely related subjects. The Jews were killed because they were unwanted and inconvenient. A child is aborted because they are unwanted and inconvenient. I want you to tell me the Holocaust was wrong and then tell me abortion is okay. You just can't do that.

It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.   I'm talking about human life, not personhood. Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious; were talking about human life.   I don't know where you get your definition   Oh I don't know, I just went to dictionary.com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do.

Also, I couldn't find a definition for potential life, only an article referring to it as a ""a clever rhetorical trick"" And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human. That ought to be obvious to any casual observer. Here is the standard definition of life;   the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.     we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day?

Something that was, by the standard definition of life, alive is now not alive, by the standard definition of life. So if something was alive we refer to it as dead.

They really don't care about what the baby goes through and that is completely wrong!

"The ""baby"" is not yet a baby. It's only a POTENTIAL life and not an ACTUAL life. So you're not killing a baby. If it can't survive outside of the womb yet, then it's not actually anyone else's choice but the mother's. Noone else can keep it alive, then they should butt out and leave it up to the mothers. If she wants to put it up for adoption, great!, If not, it's her choice since she is the one that has to keep it alive inside her.

"100% i think its wrong! I am not religious, but who has the right to take a life? Isn't that the very reason Murderer's are punished?  If a person really can't have a child because they aren't ready, or any other reason, then surly it is fairer to still give that life a chance and put the baby up for adoption to a family who is desperate for a baby and can't have one for themselves?

"If you take a life you should be punished. But before the fetus can survive outside of the mother's womb, it's not yet a life, it's only a POTENTIAL life, like an egg or sperm, that's all.

"“For You created my inmost being;You knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in a secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, Your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in Your book before one of them came to be.” Psalm 139:13-16. God created you, He created me, and He has created everybody. Life is a gift. Nobody has a right to take away that gift. Life starts at conception. Mother Teresa said ""What is taking place in America is a war against the child … And if we accept that the mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another."" This war against the child is abortion. If I tell a pregnant woman she can kill her baby, why can't I tell a man that it is alright to murder a three year-old. What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering a child nine weeks after birth?   During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people. That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?    Dr. Richard Land, president of The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,said ""We lose more babies through abortion every year than the total fatalities in all of the wars in which we have ever participated, commencing with the French and Indian War and including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, and Gulf War II.” In 2005 1.2 million abortions were performed. Even though this number is the lowest since 1974, this is still too many abortions. Every twenty seconds a child is aborted. Fifty-six percent of women who have abortions are in their twenties and sixty-one percent of women who have abortions have one or more children. According to Guttmacher Institute, the reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner.   Many pro-choice posters say “My Body. My Right.” Woman don't take into consideration that their decision to have an abortion affects not only their body, but the unborn babies. Jeremiah 1:5 says ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.” The Lord knew you, even before conception!    Women who have abortions are only thinking about themselves. What have they forgotten? Have not considered that this baby is a living person? Three weeks after conception a baby has a heartbeat and at four and a half months she can experience pain. By nine weeks, he has begun to develop blood vessels, eyes, lungs, ears, arms, legs, mouth, nose, the color of his eyes, fingers, toes, brain, joints, teeth, spinal cord, nervous system, and facial muscles. He can also hiccup frown, squint, turn his head, touch his face, breath (without air), stretch, and yawn. He is well proportioned, about the size of a thumb, and every organ is present. Exodus 21: 22-25 says “If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.”   But instead of condemning women who have made this choice, we should come to them with compassion, offering them help. After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years —5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual. Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome. Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain. Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both. We should also inform women who are considering abortion about the procedure and effects of abortion and other options such as adoption. Crisis Pregnancy Centers can be found in most metropolitan areas. Many Crisis Pregnancy Centers in Illinois metropolitan areas offer pregnancy tests, ultrasound services, adoption plans, parenting education, clothing rooms, and post-abortion help. According to Hope Pregnancy Ministries ninety percent of abortion-minded women choose life after seeing their ultrasound.   Luke 1:42-44 says “In a loud voice Elizabeth exclaimed: ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.” When Mary enters Elizabeth's house, John, an unborn baby, leaps for joy because he is in the presence of the Christ, another unborn baby. Dr. James I. Lamb, executive director of Lutherans For Life, said “Both Mary and Elizabeth experienced an ‘unplanned’ pregnancy. Both their babies were still in their wombs. Both trusted God in seemingly impossible situations."" That the Christ would become a baby shows just how sacred life is.

It's fine if you believe that, but don't go around forcing that belief on others. I'm sure the bible has a passage somewhere about how you should respect your neighbours.

"That's called discrimination based on level of dependency   No, it's called discrimination based on level of development. Before it reaches a certain stage in development, it'd still only be a potential and it shouldn't have any rights whatsoever.  .   Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious   I'm not ignoring anything. I'm trying to clarify things for, apparently, a stubborn fool. A human potential life before a certain stage in its development shouldn't be afforded any rights whatsoever.  .   What you call ""potential"" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not.   You're still dishing out BS and completely ignoring my points. Look up ""potential"" separately, then marry the 2 definitions together and then you should read this: I agree that it's life, I'm only making a distinction that it's potential. This is the case because even though it may have all the internal systems of a human life, they're in no condition to function until a certain stage is reached in its development. That's why it's a potential life. If you're incapable of putting the meanings of 2 separate words together, we should stop any further discussions.  .   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day?   Don't quotemine my arguments for your benefit. I said we make laws to help us with our lives.

"Unborn babies are living things and when you kill them, it is the same thing as killing an adult or a child. God is the creator of life and when you kill unborn babies you are destroying his creations. In the beginning God created Adam by breathing the breath of life into his nostrils. “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” Psalm 139:13.   Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides. If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder. He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods. You should help everyone stay healthy and alive.   I have four sisters and I am glad none of us have been aborted.
",0
"""it is the same as killing an adult or a child""... No, it is not. It is only a POTENTIAL life and not ACTUAL life. Before week 20, the fetus cannot survive outside of the mother's womb. It must be attached to her and be supplied with her blood. If society can't keep it alive, then society should not make laws forcing mothers to keep their unwanted pregnancies. It is physically attached to her and is a part of her and must be her choice.

"Yes it should be banned. People shouldn't be having sex if they don't wanna a baby. Or it should be protected. Killing babies is a crime.

"People shouldn't be having sex? Doesn't that mean they'll be preventing babies from being born = preventing conception in the first place? What if that baby wanted to be conceived but its parents decided to use a condom and prevented it from being? How far back to the future do you want to take this ""life"" argument?   Here's where I draw the line: Before the fetus can digest milk via its digestive tract, it is entirely the mother's decision whether it should be aborted or not. It is PHYSICALLY a part of her and is not yet capable of survival without direct connection to her (via the umbilical cord) and so it is her decision and should not be made illegal.

"Ok, before you go around saying having an abortion = killing ""somebody"" consider this:  does a pregnant woman need a passport for her belly when she travels? Does the fetus inside of her know anything? Can it make any decisions? What kind of a ""person"" is it? IT'S NOT A PERSON!  Before it can survive outside of its mother's womb, it is not society's choice but the mother's choice. Don't take that choice away from the mother.

"her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK   I can assure the only person who looks silly here is you. A man is HALF the responsibility of a  pregnancy . It's not my fault that a man has no say in abortion maybe if you actually read what I type you would of seen me say that it's probably unfair that a man by law is denied a say. However in a lot of circumstances the woman consults with the man and they come to a mutual agreement on whether to continue the pregnancy or not.   Who is the one that gets pregnant? Can the man get pregnant? Who takes the risk? Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is   A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk. They are both equally responsible for a  pregnancy . I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.   It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.   It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me? Here is one of Margaret's views  advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called ""socially undesirable people""  so I'm a racist now? And there is a massive difference here for a start. I don't believe anyone should be  forced  to have an abortion it's their  choice .   And another  She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers, and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf, blind and dependent. She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I  think  abortion is okay.   it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb   If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?
",1
"Will you just go away and actually really people's arguments for once? I said aborting a baby at 24 weeks is inhumane as it has a chance to survive if the mother were to deliver naturally. I've also previously said the abortion gestation should be lowered from 24 weeks.  The problem you're not getting here is that I don't believe people should just go around aborting the babies all the time. I believe a negative circumstance should give the woman the choice to abort.

"And what is a negative circumstance that would meet your appoval?   Is it your business why a woman aborts? My neice was born at 23 weeks.....and babies have lived a few weeks earlier than that. Do you think you could pinpoint the EXACT point in the pregnancy when the fetus is work saving? I would think since abortion kills, that you would want to be right on the money here. Or doesn't it make any difference?  So what is your stance on abortion?
",0
"It has nothing to do my with my  approval . I'm using negative circumstance as an example as to why a woman might abort.  Not a few weeks earlier I do believe the youngest was 22 weeks. I'm not arguing that, which leads me to believe you DO NOT read the arguments people make! I think the latest gestation for abortion should be lowered.  Here you go Mr. Science.  Most scientists agree that pain is experienced in the cortical areas of the brain, which do not develop until the second trimester. Painful experiences result in autonomic (they occur automatically during pain) physiologic changes that can be measured. For example, when we fell pain, our bodies produce endorphins and cortisol to help deal with the pain. One study was conducted on fetuses during blood draws. This study showed elevated fetal plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin response to intrauterine needling early in the second trimester but not before.  So the first trimester is an ideal time for abortion which is when most occur anyway. It's extended mostly for medical reasons as some deformities and disabilities cannot be detected until the second trimester which is a time I will agree the woman has a right to an abortion in the second trimester. Answered now?

"Nobody has the right to another person's body. A woman has the right, for lack of a better term, evict. It is her body, she does not have to gestate for 9 months if she doesn't want to. Arguments about having sex mean you accept pregnancy are ludicrous.  Look at it this way. We don't require parents to give up their organs, or their blood, or their extra kidney, or even their bone marrow in order to save the life of their 1 year old child. If that child needed a transplant or it dies, we do not force the parents to donate. even something like Bone marrow, that will not kill them. We don't force anyone to undergo a medical procedure they don't want to.  So why would we force a woman to keep the fetus alive. It uses her kidneys, blood, lungs, etc. Pregnancy can cause health problems and complications worse than being a bone marrow donor, or even a kidney donor. Why would the law force a woman to go through pregnancy until the fetus is born, but not require the parents to keep the born child alive? Why does the fetus get special protection that a child does not?   The woman needs to choose to gestate for 9 months, and accept the risks that go with it at every stage. She has the right to change her mind if the risks become to great, or even her awareness of the risks become too great. When she becomes pregnant, she should have the right to research and evaluate the risks of carrying to term consult with her doctor and accept or reject those risks.

"So then you are one of the pro-aborts who believe the woman has the right to kill all the way through the 40 weeks, right? Wow.   But the created human being is not apart of the womans body that is what you just don't get. She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either. The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame...unless a rape occurred.   Abortion is the most performed medical procedure on earth. It is not like other procedures as abortion kills. The abortionists task, goal is to make sure the human being who is alive, is dead when he/she gets through with it. Now if you don't value life then you condone it. If you do, then you don't. Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube. Other than the egg and the sperm...she did not use any organs of her mothers body.,,just a safe place to grow and mature. Pregnancy and giving birth is the most natural thing on earth. It has been going on since the beginning of time. Most pregnancies are uncomplicated and most women would do fine never even seeing a doctor during pregnancy.   A child who is alive would get all the things you say they wouldnt. No hospital on earth would deny lifesaving measures taken to save a child. Even in the cases where parents want to deny....for religious reasons, the courts usually overturn their wishes. Also in the case of death...if parents kill their child out of the womb....its murder. If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not. So the born child gets protection, the womb child does not.

"She didnt need to get pregnant if she didn't want too either   Why don't you respond to my posts? I've said this before but woman do take measures to not get pregnant by using contraception. Contraception  fails . I got pregnant on the contraceptive pill which I took correctly, it happens (I didn't abort by the way, but it's just an example). Or do you consider contraception killing of a potential child too?   The fact is...if you have sex if you are a woman, YOU take the chance of getting pregnant. It is her responsiblity and she is the one taking the RISK. No one else is to blame..   Wow , you're one hell of a sexist! Why does a woman have to take sole responsibility of a pregnancy? How dare you say no one else to blame! The man is just as responsible for the action of sex and creating a life yet he wouldn't get your giant speech on the immorality or creating unwanted life. Not once in the whole discussion have you ever mentioned the males role in creating a baby just how terrible the woman is.   Louise Brown was conceived in a test tube. Other than the egg and the sperm...she did not use any organs of her mothers body   She was  conceived  in a test tube. She didn't spend 9 months on a petri dish growing. Her embryo was placed into a womb and relied on a woman's organs to live. Your statement is all wrong.   If she (the man is not an issue) kills it while its in the womb....it is not   The man is not the issue? Do you realize how many woman get abortions because the person who impregnated them pressured them into doing so? The men often  want  the woman they got pregnant to abort. He is just as responsible for creating the life as she is and if  wants  her to abort then he is just as responsible for the termination.

"Yes contraception fails..........but that does not chance the facts. The woman knows it MIGHT fail...and chooses to do it anyway. The responsiblity is HERS.   I believe what science says...  Some people do not make a connection between birth control and abortion. You probably see them as two different acts. The fact is however that some birth control are abortifacients because they work by causing early term abortions. The IUD seems to prevent a fertilized egg a new human being from implanting in the uterine wall. The pill does not always stop ovulation, but sometimes prevents implantation of the growing embryo. And now we have the RU-486 pill that aborts a new fetus, a new baby.   I am not a sexist....you are, your pro-choice position is sexist. You think this is just a womans issue, that the father who has DNA in the newly created human being should not have a say in the matter of whether his child is killed or not. I believe they should have a say. I would bet you dont. So who is sexist? LOL  You want the woman to have her cake and eat it too. You want the father to pay, only if SHE decides to have the child...and in that case you would go after him for child support. What rights does the father of this newly concieved child have? NONE. You give him none......I don't. The fact is....pregnancy takes place in the womans body. The man deposits the sperm.....and that is it. She allows him to do this. If you think he has and should be responsible.......THEN WHY DENY HIM THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHILD? You are the sexist one, not me.   Our government tells the father.......YOU ARE NOT IMPORANT until the child is born, whether you want it or not...then get out your wallet. The woman holds ALL THE CARDS...and your giving her a pity party.   My statement is right about Louise Brown. She was concieved in a petri dish....nothing the mother or father did...helped.   It's a scientific fact that the mother is one distinctive and self-contained person and the child is another. Being inside something is NOT the same as being part of something and ones body does not belong to another’s body merely because of proximity. Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried.   In July 2000 the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill making it illegal to execute a pregnant woman. The logical reason for this decision is that a preborn child is an individual person, distinct from his mother and with his own separate right to life. As I said our laws are wishy washy.   Human beings should not be discriminated against because of their place of residence should they? I am sure you would think that premature baby lying in a hospital incubator deserves to live. Would the exact same baby deserve to live any less because she was still in her mother?  But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   Your worldview is sad...........  You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic. I picket them...never seen one dragged in, not in ten years. No woman gets an abortion unless SHE CONSENTS. Place the blame where it belongs. It is her body she has the right to decide. There are places that would help her....I work in one.

"The responsiblity is HERS   Stop saying this the man is half responsible for pregnancy he had sex and impregnated. Pregnancy is the responsibility of two people.    You think this is just a womans issue, that the father who has DNA in the newly created human being should not have a say in the matter of whether his child is killed or not   I'm sorry I must have missed saying that men have no right to decide if his child is aborted. Oh wait that's because I didn't say that... My claims of you being sexist are because what you said  is  sexist. You're just trying to stipulate what I think when I have not said anything along the lines of males shouldn't be involved or have a say.    You want the father to pay, only if SHE decides to have the child...and in that case you would go after him for child support   Huh? Every woman that has a child is single and goes after the father for child support? Not that this has any relevance to abortion since the child would have to be born for a father to pay for it.   The man deposits the sperm.....and that is it. She allows him to do this   Sexist again. He allows himself to do it as much as she allows him.    THEN WHY DENY HIM THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS CHILD   I don't deny him the right. The mother does, not once have I said this is right or correct. Stop putting words into my mouth. And they aren't always denied the right anyway. A lot of woman consult with the father before having a termination.   and your giving her a pity party   So any father who provides for his child, within a relationship or not, is simply giving their child money out of pity? Don't be so idiotic. And stop implying that all a father does is pay money he cares for the child as much as the mother. And by the way, damn right he should pay. He had sex without contraception he knew the consequences as much as the woman, he should be involved with providing financially as much the mother!    Brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the Petri dish where she was concieved. A child is not part of the body in which she is carried   Since a unborn baby relies on the mother to provide for it through the umbilical cord of course it's a part of her. The embryo didn't rely on the petri dish to nurture and nourish it.   But then in your opinion....a poor baby, a handicapped baby...should be left to die...they are not worthy to live.   I try my best to avoid getting angry but you just keep making up awful lies about me. I not once said anyone isn't worthy to live or deserves to die. I said I understand if a woman wants to have an abortion for these reasons.   You are a blamer........wow. No woman is dragged into an abortion clinic.   Who did I blame? When did I say a woman is dragged into an abortion clinic?  Look debate with me all you like but don't for one moment assume that you know everything about my opinions and thoughts. Instead of accusing me of ludicrous opinions and awful things that I have said not said perhaps ask for my view on a topic.

"That's funny: she was so keen on 'evicting' when she had someone's dick up inside her C:  Arguments that say ""Cause and Effect don't matter if you don't like it"" are also ludicrous. The very purpose of sex IS to have children. That is fact.  I love how people like using things with no regard for the CONSEQUENCES and as soon as they are faced with the consequences they decide to take the easy way out. It's the same thing with people who abuse alcohol.  You get drunk: The result is a hangover.  That's science.  You CHOSE to get drunk.  You also CHOOSE to risk the hangover.  If you can't handle consequences, then don't act on the cause!

"Abortion is right because the moral values that ""pro life"" advocates usually hold is that of religious sediments, most of the time disregarding whether or not abortion is helpful to society. Abortion prevents unwanted children, and or growth in areas where we most certainly wouldn't want it. Abortion increases happy family rates, and higher average level of education among families. A fetus is, for all intents and purposes, part of the women until removed from the women, and before any pro lifers try to mince those words I'll go outright and say yes it does mean I support the abortion of a child no matter the stage of development, an unwanted baby that couldn't be dealt with for whatever reason at one point weeks is no different from a unwanted baby at another. Ignorant religious people argue that such barbaric elimination of human life is evil, but I find it odd that they would object to something that would result in the immediate entry to heaven(by my knowledge Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all believe babies who die go straight to heaven). Why subject them to the hardships of life when they aren't wanted? I also agree with the fact that mothers should have the only say in whether or not she has an abortion( I also believe however that a man who wants an abortion but gets denied should have the right to be exempt from child support) My ideas on the subject go into extremes far beyond normal pro choice standards, but I honestly feel satisfaction in knowing I support something that is beneficial to society. And before anyone questions the lack of ""morals"" behind my believes just know that in our modern world, ""morality"" has no meaning, just different perceptions developed from our understanding of religion. Without religion there would be no such thing as ""evil"". I prefer to live in a world driven by logic, and to that point abortion is a logical way to better structure the family units in the world today.

"Actually: I came up with my opinions of Abortion without the help of religion. I researched the topic independently, and tried to learn every angle that I could from BOTH sides. I'm pro-life in the definition of I think that every person should have equal opportunity to live, and that people should give the life as much chance to live as possible.  I think abortions that are NOT based on betterment for the woman or baby's health is wrong.   Why should eliminating someone's chance at life be an option just because it's CONVENIENT for the woman?  I care about all people in general having the chance to life their life to the fullest.  Not what people in the Bible said about it.  And abortion only prevents a child from being a 'bother' to their parents (unless it's for medical reasons). The parents decided to have sex knowing FULL WELL that they had the risk of having a child. But once they are met with the result of sex they want to bail out because they don't want to be inconvenienced with something THEY MADE.  If people are going to choose to do something, they need to take responsibility for their actions.

"""Why should eliminating someone's chance at life be an option just because it's CONVENIENT for the woman?""  Because it's part of the woman until birth.   ""If people are going to choose to do something, they need to take responsibility for their actions.""  You are not one to judge what is the correct way of taking responsibility.   I'd argue more but you don't go anywhere beyond the whole ""life deserves a chance"" stance. You say you read into both sides but I don't believe that as I see no reference to the societal benefits of abortion in your response.

"And that is wrong? Atheism is a religion. Listen when I debate I rarely if ever bring up religion, I don't have too. Science is clear about when human life starts.   Although I think you are unbelievable in what your post says here...again, I think at least you have the guts to spew what you feel and stand by it. The content is well...cold, inhumane, compassionless,empty....I could go on....  I believe in the saying keep your friends close, but your enemy even closer. I want people like you close.  I believe in free speech...so I am going to address and comment on the things you say here in the most honest way possible. Your views mirror Hitler and Margaret Sangers on life so it seems. Not totally, don't know if your a racist....but on the issue of abortion and many societal factors I think your pretty close. They thought killing certain segments of the population for the good of society was right. You feel the same way...only those you want to kill are in the womb. Do you also feel that people who are already born who are handicapped, mentally challenged, poor, those under a certain IQ should be eliminated? Maybe you do I don't know. Your worldview is simply one of the coldest I have seen.   Abortion prevents unwanted children.....Well first off there is no such thing as an unwanted child. There are people that adopt children every day.  Abortion increases happy family rates....Well if you think murder and killing make you happy then, that alone says a lot about a character of someone.   Abortion tears families apart. Abortion can affect a woman mentally for the rest of her life. It can cause shame, anquish and psychological trauma not only for her but for the father, children even grandparents if they know about the abortion. Most women who have had an abortion never tell anyone because of the stigma, because they know what they have done. If you think living with abortion is easy then you have another thing coming. We will never know statistically how many women suffer because most do not get help, most do not come forward and share.   Studies show that what I am saying is true. If you would like a list of many studies would be happy to fork them over.  Where are you getting the information that abortion increases the level of education? LOL Could you site that study would love to read it.  The fact is Guttmaucher says this...which does not make sense with what you are saying.  ""Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 15-17 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 18-19 obtain 11%, and teens under age 15 obtain 0.4%.""  "" Women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 20–24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 25-29 obtain 24%.""  Now this age group would be out of high school and college, most are not even in school.    ""About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.""  This group is not going to school....most likely because they have multiple children at home. And if they are going for multiple abortion using it as birth control, they are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Abortion is not cheap and they obviously didn't learn by the first abortion.  "" Forty-two percent of women obtaining abortions have incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level ($10,830 for a single woman with no children).""  Not the highest education group. You think by having an abortion these womens educational level will go up? LOL  Most abortion clinics are in poorer neightborhoods because it was set up that way. Sanger was a racist and she though blacks were inferior (Hitler admired her and agrees which history can attest to that)so she targeted them specifically.

"""Atheism is a religion""  No it's not. I view atheism is the theory that there isn't a god, and under those contexts it isn't a religion because it doesn't group in any way shape or form.  ""I think at least you have the guts to spew what you feel and stand by it. The content is well...cold, inhumane, compassionless,empty....I could go on....""  Yes I dropped the fear of being open in my views no matter how extreme they are. Cold, maybe, but compassionless? No, at least not by the standard I hold myself to believing that it helps society. Empty? definitely not, my view has a defined purpose that only seems wrong by the dim standards developed by the main religions of the world.(you will hear me criticize religion whenever I see logic spawned from religion born patterns of thinking.  ""I believe in the saying keep your friends close, but your enemy even closer. I want people like you close.""  I respectfully agree.  ""Your views mirror Hitler and Margaret Sangers on life so it seems. Not totally, don't know if your a racist....but on the issue of abortion and many societal factors I think your pretty close.""   I respect Hitler's ability to have fixed the economy of Germany, yes. I don't care for the extermination of a race, no. I don't believe it's wrong to admire the positive side to a negative situation.  ""They thought killing certain segments of the population for the good of society was right. You feel the same way...only those you want to kill are in the womb""  I do believe it's right(womb not the killing of functioning members of society), Im not going to play the shifty democrat here and change my positions constantly which will appall you in the coming comment most likely.   ""Do you also feel that people who are already born who are handicapped, mentally challenged, poor, those under a certain IQ should be eliminated?""  Yes I do because that is a solution to quell inheritable diseases in our species that produce members that cannot add anything to society, let alone enjoy a standard of independent life(this view applies to major disabilities, I am undecided on minor diseases that produce somewhat capable members.) As of IQ, I would love to be rid of stupid people but stupidity supplies the labor of current society I guess so not much can be done there.  ""Abortion prevents unwanted children.....Well first off there is no such thing as an unwanted child. There are people that adopt children every day.""   And there are children that grow up in an orphanage, tormented by the fact that not only did their parents not want them ,nobody else did either. That is a foundation of an unstable mind that could result in something very bad.  ""Abortion increases happy family rates....Well if you think murder and killing make you happy then, that alone says a lot about a character of someone. ""  It increases happy family rates by keeping the family unit at a desired number.  ""Abortion tears families apart. Abortion can affect a woman mentally for the rest of her life. It can cause shame, anquish and psychological trauma not only for her but for the father, children even grandparents if they know about the abortion.

We will never know statistically how many women suffer because most do not get help, most do not come forward and share""  The stigma you refer to only exists due to the unfortunate inescapable entity that is religion. And if living with an abortion is hard, then living with a child you can't take care of is harder. My evidence for that last statement being me and my mother.  ""Studies show that what I am saying is true.""   Not disputing what you are saying is true, just disputing the meaning and reason behind it.   ""If you would like a list of many studies would be happy to fork them over""   The statistics however few I have presented are more or less citations from my private political theory professor Hollis. Wish I knew her first name but never felt the need to until years after being taught.   ""Where are you getting the information that abortion increases the level of education?""   Again a loose citation but this one is more obvious. In countries with a higher reproduction rate then normal almost always live in poverty or at the very least a low standard of living. Bangladesh anyone? However, in countries with a normal or even lower then normal reproduction rate, the level of education is much higher, and that isn't by any means hard to justify.   ""Eighteen percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are teenagers; those aged 15-17 obtain 6% of all abortions, teens aged 18-19 obtain 11%, and teens under age 15 obtain 0.4%.Women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions; women aged 20–24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and women aged 25-29 obtain 24&#xNo;w this age group would be out of high school and college, most are not even in school.About 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.""  Okay? I also believe in using abortion as a birth control, although the pill seems a much better option to me.  ""Abortion is not cheap and they obviously didn't learn by the first abortion""  Well repetition is the way to learn i guess.   ""Not the highest education group. You think by having an abortion these womens educational level will go up?""  No I said the educational level of the family unit goes up, which is true, due to the fact that when you aren't forced to pay for the schooling of a kid you didn't want, then you have much more to get better schooling for a kid you did want.  ""Most abortion clinics are in poorer neightborhoods because it was set up that way. Sanger was a racist and she though blacks were inferior (Hitler admired her and agrees which history can attest to that)so she targeted them specifically. She talked at KKK meetings encouraging its members to target blacks. The Negro Project, Eugenic plan for Blacks....read them they will tell you all about her racism. ""  I don't care about her being racist. Racism is just a held view, no different then holding a preference over pulp or pulp free in your orange juice. In the field of political theory, in which I have a considerable holding, racism doesn't exist, only racial preference which actually for the sake of argument increases effectiveness among a people. Attack that if you must, but bear in mind I still have not indicated whether or not I have a preference, so don't waste too much time on it.  ""The marriage bed is the most degenerating influence in the social order,"" Sanger said.""  It is quite the negative influence when we consider the very structure of the human mind mixed with the animalistic side of our species that society strives so hard to contain, but that is a part of society not likely too change.  ""She was about forced abortion and mass sterilization for blacks. She was an inspiration to Hitler...and obviously her views still guide PP and others like you today.""  I am not for forced abortion or mass sterilization of blacks, I merely hold that abortions are a greatly positive thing in society and shouldn't by any means be discouraged. I don't care much about racial differences except how they pertain to statistics involving the economy. And like I said before, I may agree with some parts of a persons beliefs and not the other. Just because I may or may not agree with some similarly held beliefs of Margaret Sanger does not mean I by any means am inspired by her.  ""Your thinking is dangerous to society. You presume to know what is good for society...and that good has all to do with killing. Both Hitler and Sanger believed what you are saying. Look where Hitlers worldview took him.....and the others he mass murdered.""  Dangerous? No more so then religion is. At least my ""danger"" is in the name of logical progression of society and whether or not you see it that way is irrelevant. You seem to refer to Hitler in most of your debates, I believe Mao Zedong would be a much better example for the logic you are using, just a suggestion.   ""I find what you say about men and abortion commical. I am certainly praying at this point you have no children and won't. I can only imagine how they would be raised.""  I be a wonderful dad, I would let them grow their own beliefs on god and structure, those things are up to them to figure out. My duty would be protection and learning of basic functions. It is not my place in my standing to dictate how my child views thing in the world around him. If he wants to be pro life, all the power to him, as long as he(or she) truly believes in what the hold I am fine.   ""You say the woman should have the say.....and then you want to be excused from parenting if its your sperm that impregnated the woman and you dont want the baby. Ahhhh you poor thing....not included.""  Yes i do believe that. I don't think he should be able to back out if he decides to pay child support, but I do believe he should have a choice. That is probably the most destructive belief I have portrayed, but to win some you gotta give some, and the women won rights to chose whether or not they have an abortion.  ""Libertarian worldview.....all about themselves, nothing about anyone else...a cold cold unliveable philiosophy of life. Liberty for your kind is slavery, killing those they think are unworthy to live. Freedom of expression for you people is the gun....pointed at someones head. No absolutes....people just doing what they want to do even if it hurts society, even if it hurts their own family. ""  That is incorrect to the extreme but I am not here to argue my party standings. I could go on about your religion and get quite insulting, but for the sake of argument I hope you will drop your attacks on the Libertarian party and respect us for our views as I have respected you without insult(if one has slipped through the cracks I apologize, but I don't remember making an insult).   ""Your views are radical and your right you dont care about anything moral...that speak to your conscience and lack of one. For you rape could be good in some circumstances....and well we know your all for killing those that you dont think deserve to live. God only knows who is in that group.""  Yes they are radical, I am not going to deny that. And there is no such thing as moral or right or wrong. I think in terms such as beneficial and destructive. And god doesn't know because he doesn't exist. I may seem colder then usually imaginable, but when faced with issue such as abortion we must think about what is best for society. And I am actually quite the party animal, but here I am here to be logical and maybe have a beer when done.   ""Your worldview is not logical at all in fact I find it hidiously evil and dangerous. It strips away the preciousness of life and living. What a sad world you live in. Which is why those that value life....need to keep you close.""  It is logical as all my views come from a deep understanding of political theory and my understanding of what makes the human mind and what differentiates it from that of an animal(not much). No such thing as evil, said that already. And you misunderstand my intentions. In benefiting society we promote what makes us human. Progression, thinking, in making society a better place we make the world a better place. And my world is sad by no means.I seek only to progress my knowledge and thoughts of world issues.

"Such a small and lacking response makes me regret complimenting your previous one.   ""So if one of your children got a disease...or became handicapped.....would you hire the killing done or would you do it yourself?""  If it was detected during pregnancy yes I would definitely want an abortion but once it has been born it has entered the realm of society where my line is drawn. You make me out to be some serial killer yet you don't expound on how the reason behind it is flawed, you only call me evil and insult my beliefs and party.   ""You said society would be better without people such as this...I assume you meant your family as well. Right?""   Yes if a defect is detected during pregnancy. Now I am not saying they have to, I am saying that if it was up to me I would choose an abortion, and if you believe that is wrong due to your close minded perception of morality, then that is of no consequence to me. You are trying to run a perceptive analytical argument and it is frustrating me because my source of these views is based on that of a separate pattern of thinking, I am coming from a place of thought and logic, you are coming form a place born from what you perceive to be ""right"" or ""moral"" when in fact you have little to no understanding of the impacts such thinking has had on society and yet you call me a danger.

"You make several erroneous Assertions in your post.   Atheism is not a religion. It is the rejection of religion. It requires no active belief. If there were no theists there would be no atheists - we'd all just be people. Atheist is a rejection of Theism. Much like no believing in unicorns or leprechauns or anything else people claim exists but can't prove exists. Not believing in something is not a religion or else we all belong to hundreds of religions.  Abortion does prevent unwanted children. There are 1.25 Million abortions performed in the US every year. Currently there are less than 200.000 families trying to adopt. You do the math. We'd vastly outstrip the adoptive parents in the first year alone.  Women ages 20-24 are not out of high school adn college. a 4 year degree means you graduate when you are 22, some may never go but some also get higher degrees or go part time, or take a year off - so many 20-24 year olds are not out of college.

"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......it’s NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said it’s unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better.

You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crass…sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blame……and blame you do, for what is a woman’s issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortions….because I know what it’s like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess what………..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted on……‘You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.”  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robbery….and they are caught….does the police just say….ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didn’t show up, the nurse refuse to do it…the baby might have a chance.   You said, “ Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.”  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isn’t that what it’s all about, you said so yourself didn’t you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,“ Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.”  I said, if a woman and man are married……he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she can’t hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificate…and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, “What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay.”  Well you are wrong again….   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ James_Elgin_Gill    128 days early… or 21 weeks 5 days early  Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issue….personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  “If I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?""  You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????  Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?

"""Atheism is [the inmate's] religion, and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being,"" the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said.""  In this instance the inmate argued that atheism was a religion SOLELY for the purpose of being allowed to start his study group.   ""The court decided the inmate's First Amendment rights were violated because the prison refused to allow him to create a study group for atheists""  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""  ""no law respecting an establishment of religion""  Establishment =something established; a constituted order or system.  Therefor, by actually forcing atheism to be considered a religion is in violation of the law because it institutes that a study group for religion is allowed more so then a separate kind of study group. Not to mention that atheism has always been a kink in the census system. Harder then you think to put atheism into that ""other"" category.   Religion=a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects.  Atheism is not a set of beliefs. Atheism is not a practice. Atheism Is not a religion.  Atheist=a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.  By your logic, believing in ghosts is a religion.   So by all accounts, this is a mistake by the Supreme Court that will undoubtedly be fixed in the foreseeable future. Also, the supreme court does not have the right to categorize any believe except in legal matters, so they can say that agnosticism is a religion but that REALLY isn't true.   Try again.

"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conception….she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly can’t ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said it’s unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didn’t you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don’t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won’t change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAIN……….the man is an onlooker so says the law….that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Don’t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn’t he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortion…this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what it’s like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So don’t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day back…and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler’s ovens… pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliate…you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny. Bolonga…many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it….not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliate….why are you judging me from different standards than you live by………   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you don’t like how I put things……..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.

Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out there…you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?

"What I define as moral is what I have learnt is correct and righteous from the World. Certain things require to be excused. There cannot be just an ending. There always is a story. An abortion done for reasons cuz you made out with out protection is Bizzare. But,sometimes abortion is a requirement. My Best Friend's neighbour had an abortion. That abortion was needed cuz not only was she physically unfit but also mentally imbalanced. If they let the baby grow in her, she would probably harm the baby before he met the World. I'm not trying to side anyone's reason. I'm just saying that the World has to work in accordance with the right amount.

"But you are siding with the side that is pro-abortion. The child in the womb is never at fault, never deserves to be dismembered alive. It does not matter what excuse you can come up with...the unborn does not deserve it. But people like you side against life for reasons that YOU THINK are good enough for it to be killed.   You advocate death for the child of the mother who is mentally imbalanced. You said she might damage her baby should she be allowed to continue the pregnancy. You care more about the ""what if's"" than what actually might happen. What do you think abortion is? Why not take the chance that she might not harm the baby? You want to kill it by abortion anyway...this is a violent act.   What difference does it make whether she harms it or someone is hired to kill it? It dies in both scenarios?

I'm not going to say that there is never a choice. There always is a choice. Look... Sometimes, giving birth to a baby is risky. It might mean the mother's life too...    What difference does it make whether she harms it or someone is hired to kill it? It dies in both scenarios?   Yeah.. Give birth to it then, when it can fully understand the meaning of pain and let it die. While you could have saved it all the pain. All that torture. Like... We had a nuclear tragedy in India. The birth effects are just preposterous. Kids died when they reached the age of 1 or 2. The mothers were denied of abortions, not by the hospitals but the family members. Some of the women weren't healthy enough for the birth process and hence they died. Even today Women are forced despite their health conditions.  I do not say it is right. But, it is never just a Yes or a No. There are always issues. There must be exceptions. To certain things. Certain 'unavoidable' things.  I agree with everything that you mention. It isn't wrong. But, I only mean to emphasis on those few things that stand importance too.

Just to have fun or if killing someone makes you happy. Did I tell that anywhere? No..    Could you make a list....?   The fetus is poisoned.   The pregnancy goes wrong.  Either the mother or the baby can be saved.   99% are for social reasons,   I wasn't here to defend myself, but I told you I'm not 'for' such abortions. They must be stopped.   It is sad that you do not value the life in the womb.   I'll tell you what is sadder. It is sad that you do not wanna see the other side of the possibilities. Why abortions are sometimes important. You might believe just right out that I have no value for life in the womb. I don't think you can just say that cuz you call yourself pro-life. Value must exist. For life inside the womb and outside.   I've been telling you constantly that I'm just trying to explain that I do agree with some of your thoughts, just not all. There must be exceptions. Not easy, but essential one's. You cannot tighten the rules so hard that the humanity you are fighting for has no easy solution.

"And how would the fetus be poisoned? You mean the mother did drugs or something?  And the pregnancy you said could go wrong? How...as I said, less than 1% of all abortions happen because of danger to mother or baby.  You say abortion should be stopped? How? And what reasons is ok to kill?  Why are abortions important? To the unborn killed? Or to the woman who is killing for social reasons?  The solution for woman today....is abortion which most use as one method of birth control. Most women do not have just one abortion...but two and three. So they are killing multiple times. The humanity I am fighting for are the 99% of unborns killed for social reasons.

"You said, “Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.”  It takes two, the woman can’t conceive on her own and no man can produce a child on his own. But that has nothing to do with responsibility. Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married…does not take him into consideration, should she want to abort. He simply is not an issue. The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide.     If they are both are responsible for the risks they take…then why are the fathers rights stripped?  You said, “Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.”  Yes he does. Yes he does. Yes he does. BUT, he also knows he can walk away if he doesn’t want to be involved. Example…..  Two kids having sex on the beach during spring break. They want to have sex obviously for pleasure. They might not even know their names or where they are from. Now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant? The guy or the gal. Who can fade into the sunset, never to be seen or heard from again? THE MAN She takes the big risk. What risk did the kid take? NONE. This Cassie Anthony trial…..she says she has no idea who the father of Caylee was. She was known for sleeping around and they did DNA samples on many of her acquaintances. Nothing turned up. They even did DNA on her father and brother. Who got pregnant, who had the baby? She did…because whether reckless sex happened or not…the risk she took didn’t pan out….she got pregnant….and where is the dad???????  You said, “If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds. Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?”  Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him.   You said, “Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?”   Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You’re so ridiculous it’s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings “  You also said, “You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what I said   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.  I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.”  And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig…to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective? You gotta come up with something better than this. LOL   A pig is a filthy animal that lives in a sty………LMAO   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates…when I have not. Is it because of my name? Again ignorance…go research what a churchmouse is. Do you think that Christians because of the love commandment should just take it…roll over and play dead? Why do you judge me by perfect standards and not yourself. You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts…and makes you look like you have no class. You use the F bomb like it’s a conjunction. Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter…..but will leave it with these two. Why don’t you do some heavy research on this…not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts. Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.  I said, “You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason…that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.  You said, I know and your point is?”  And this is not championing abortion? LMAO And you want people to believe your pro-life? LMAO  I said this, “It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man Then you replied with this. “This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They both decide to have sex, they both know the risks, they both procreate. They are both responsible.”  Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I’m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat…unless he is married and the courts order him to pay. Did the kid on the beach have to do anything? How many one night stands you think happen when the male just takes off…knowing or not knowing if he impregnanted the woman?  You said, “An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.'  Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.  You said, “The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.”  Only because she says YES. He goes on her invite. If they are running around the bases…have not scored a grand slam… and she says no……..it’s no, you can’t come in. If he does against her wishes it’s rape. Instigating has nothing to do with this. But whose body is changed by the sex act? Not his..Hers. She knows that what he might leave behind will affect her for at least nine months. He knows that it won’t affect him in the least…..UNLESS HE IS MARRIED.     “How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.”  It does take a man and a woman to procreate…which is why I also am against same sex unions, it’s not natural…but that’s another debate. They both have sex….blah blah……..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?  Sure some married couples are on the same page….but we will never know how many married women go behind their spouses backs to kill, because they know their husband would not approve. There is no way of knowing that statistic.  You said, “Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.  Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don’t want to see the evidence. You want the killing option open which in my opinion is cold.  You said, “I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.”  Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least. I am not a hypocrite, I simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story. My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way.     Tell me……Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn’t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can’t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed….and I am allowed to change my mind…..are you?   When you make a huge mistake….if you have children don’t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? What you’re saying here….is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don’t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant….. but then you’re perfect remember?   “In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.”  Oh my goodness don’t. I was not a child when I had it….I should have known better…and I took the risk because I knew what would happen. But like most others in the heat of passion I guess I didn’t care and did it anyway. No one thrusted anything on me, and guess what, I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok. I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN….and have a blessed life. Christ forgave me when I became His. And I promised Him that abortion would be my witness…to share what HE did for me in my hour of need. I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard. We were on the same page…until later…when I started suffering, he could not understand my feelings. He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs, he didn’t. Worldviews change….and mine did drastically. We have adjusted…and he now tolerates my feelings, actions. I do not force my beliefs on him. I pray someday we will be on the same page.     You said, “I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?”  Distraught about what? Tell me….how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip….then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? I don’t get it. Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Here watch this……..and if you don’t, think about the reasons why you won’t. Search your heart…about why you would support something so barbaric. And if you have children….put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered.      http://www.catholic.org/video/?v=13       I am not Catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion.     “I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.”  What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young? I wouldn’t tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons. I would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex. I told my kids when they were teenagers. It’s not selfish…its real life and it happens. Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me? It’s the most performed surgery in the world.     I said, “You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not…BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill  You said, “Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.”  You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you’re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch…shows. That’s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life.  “What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.”  Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing….and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated……good should have overcome evil, but didn’t. People act out of fear….and I am sure there were people who did not like what Hitler was doing BUT DIDN’T DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIM…I am talking about the people in his own country….the people who could have physically taken himout….the guards, etc.   Abortion is like that….people sit by and do nothing….they think anything they do….won’t change the laws, won’t help the victim. But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion….if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and good…….abortion would once again be considered murder. If we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortion….wow….how many lives would be changed, hearts mended. But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God…and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. I work with people who are atheists….so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference. Its knowing what is right and wrong, what is good and evil………..standing up for it, no matter what.  You said, “Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.”  Again talking about standing up for what is right, doing the right thing……..even if you are swimming up stream. I know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to none……but I keep working and praying I am wrong. Society is sinking into a moral less abyss.  You said, “I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.”  You condone murder….I never called you a racist.     You said, “I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?”  I never use violent adjectives on you….you used a noun to describe me. And swearing is classless…  .  “I didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it was true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.”  Well you hold the cards to your future eternity. No one else is responsible but you. And if you’re wrong…you will have all eternity to think about it. How do you know EVERYONE has been condemned? And how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends? If you went to hell with them…..being with family etc…would be just a tad bit good…you would have support, be near the ones you love. And if you have support, then it is not hell. LOL What happens if you get there and you can’t find anyone? Well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them I suppose.   I know many people in my family who will not go…that is their choice. I bothers me, and I cry about it sometimes when I am praying. But I love Christ more than any other person in the world….and I have faith in Him….more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect….and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved.  “You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?”  It’s funny all the nonreligious, materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion, must be they think about it a lot. LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with. I am certainly not trying to get revenge, come on. I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And….you are judging me…I point out what you say that are untruths but I am not judging your heart….I can’t, scripture does not allow me to do that…not unless you claim to be a Christian. That is why I bring no scriptures up with you because you don’t know better. God will judge you. I can however judge actions (not hearts) of Christians as they can judge mine and many have done that…I thank them for it because many times more than I would like to admit, I needed judgement. Why do you quote a book you don’t believe in? LOL  You said, “No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.”  You don’t believe in it, yet you use it to make a point. LOL     You said, “I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.”  You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period….live with it accept the label take it as your own.  You said, “Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is my words. You ask for evidence you get it.”  LOL Boy you are really diggin deep now…. I post rarely from Wikipedia….and on this forum have posted from very reliable sources. I am not however handing my posts in to be graded….so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work….I live a full life and when I get on here….I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper ….it would be correct.     You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie….I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know….  “I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c”  This is your worldview…and explains what I said all along…why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.     You said, “What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?”  Who is setting abortion clinics on fire? If you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the world……its nothing. Pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the law…just try to change it. Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   You simply act like a juvenile. You have no class... You do not even know what you are saying.   LOL  You said two things in your post…………you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks….and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Can’t let this one go……your hilarious. I mean that in the nicest comedic way possible. LOL     This is what you said earlier… You said, “I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.”  So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain….or 24 weeks when obviously it can’t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.   Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw…you don’t.

"How...as I said, less than 1% of all abortions happen because of danger to mother or baby.   That is unavoidably important. And hence, I'm trying to explain that abortions cannot just be tagged a crime. Sometimes they are important to be done.   Why are abortions important?    For the reasons above..   Or to the woman who is killing for social reasons?

"And is abortion for social reasons ok? I think you ran from answering this one. You said they are wrong....  WHEN?

"And is abortion for social reasons ok?   I'll repeat it again. No. They are not okay.    You said they are wrong....  WHEN?   You make out one night and then get pregnant and then you do an abortion. That is wrong.  You kill a baby cuz your unhappy with it's sex kind.  You kill a baby cuz you are not ready for one.  You kill a baby cuz you were raped and that baby is unwanted. I'm sure you don't reckon or enjoy it's birth. But, that gives no one a right to kill a baby.  I believe that abortions are a strict no until really required.  If the mom is incapable of the birth process or is too weak or may communicate a murderous disease or until your life is at the stake.  I'm glad that you are fighting for the right of the 99% of the unborn. I appreciate the fact that there a certain few who are involved. You fight for those who are killed for social reasons. But, I'm trying to explain that there is no need to be so cross about this process. At a level, the strictness must be loosened and all the guilt saved. There must be exceptions. Valid exceptions.

"I see what you are saying. The only exception I see for abortion is if the mothers life is in danger which is less than 1% of all cases... I see that you are really prolife and that is a good thing, I am so glad. Thumbs up to you.
",1
"I am so glad. Thumbs up to you.   Did you really just say that? Wow... Thanks!    I see that you are really prolife    I wish I fully was.  Infact I used a lot of your opinions in a class presentation. So thank you!

"Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married   Even if they are married it's the woman's decision still so this has no validity.   Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him   No, no, no. If he is considered on ALL grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead.   And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig…to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective?   You also called me a sissy? Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. It's not an adjective. Brush up on your English language. It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp.   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   I'm a fully fledged adult. It is not the truth it's your opinion. And I'm arrogant yet your  feelings  have to be the truth?   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates…when I have not.   Yay another list for me to make. Things you have said religiously to back your opinion:  He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs,  But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion…  But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God…and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws.  But I love Christ more than any other person in the world….and I have faith in Him….more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect….and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved  I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this.   You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts…and makes you look like you have no class.    No, a swear word is a word. It means nothing. Oh look another insult to me. Why thank you very much. And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos!   Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter…..but will leave it with these two   I think a few re reads are in order here. Read their opinion and read mine. It's not even comparible.   Why don’t you do some heavy research on this…not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts.   My education is nursing. I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. My opinion is what  you  think is heartless and cold. To many others it is acceptable and logic. Don't speak for the world  .    Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.   I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that. I don't champion killing, I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself. I just understand why people do.   Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I’m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat…unless he is married and the courts order him to pay   Biology isn't sexist again I study it. The context in which you describe things is sexist. The truth is what you perceive it to be. The truth is never what  you  think. Yes he does. If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support.   They both have sex….blah blah……..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?   My fiance and I weren't married. He took responsibility. He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception. Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion.   Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don’t want to see the evidence.    No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. I use my evidence you use yours. Why does it matter?   Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.   Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated? No, I have educated myself and come to a conclusion. You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. That's the difference between you and I, I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. You're a forcer, you think that everyone  has  to share your opinion or they're a bad person. And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England.   Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least.   So because I believe woman have the right to abortion I no longer have feelings. I feel empathy and sympathy, it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences. Stop word twisting.   My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way   It's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim I want abortion to be seen positively. Consistence in the key in debating. Something you clearly don't have.   Tell me……Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn’t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can’t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed….and I am allowed to change my mind…..are you?   Yes and yes. I never denied this fact so I guess I'll just answer the first two questions. You can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and I never claimed it to be. I'm allowed to change my mind, I probably won't on this topic though.   What you’re saying here….is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don’t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant….. but then you’re perfect remember?   No I'm not. I'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself. Again I'm aware of the consequences of abortion. Are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted? Explain to me exactly when I have judged someone and acted arrogantly? Thanks for calling me perfect all the time. I don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason.   When you make a huge mistake….if you have children don’t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them?   I protect my child and I will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. But I'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset. I won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up. A lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize. If my daughter was ever pregnant I'd help her. If she asks for the pros and cons I will tell her. If she asks me what to do I will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. Why? Because her happiness is the most important thing to me.   Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing….and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated……good should have overcome evil, but didn’t.   People stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared. And people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice. They didn't  let  Jews get gassed. Everyone participated? That's a wild claim to make. Most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that.   Oh my goodness don’t. I was not a child when I had it….   Did I say you were?   I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok.   And I'm arrogant. Stop calling me perfect, I'm blushing.   I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN….and have a blessed life.   Great. I have a wonderful child to. This means nothing to the debate subject. And being with same man isn't an accomplishment. It's a choice.    I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard.   You aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't? Or that they're like Hitler? That they are murderers? Come off your high horse..   Distraught about what?   Having an abortion, derp.   how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip….then go against what your morals tell you is wrong?   It is a horrible experience. My morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances.    Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…Anyone who does not see one and think it’s horrendous…is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Abortion is horrible, I've seen many. (The nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). It's not cold, uncompassionate and empty. You yourself said it's emotionless. How can it be empty then? I'm a bad person even though I assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth? Do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save? And because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers?    What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young?    Of course abortion is upsetting for a child. The word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age? I thought that was common knowledge.   I told my kids when they were teenagers. It’s not selfish…its real life and it happens.   So they weren't children....   Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me?    Abortion of a sibling effects someone personally. Watching south park doesn't.   LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with   Well I listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance. Of course I have problem with racism.   You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you’re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch…shows. That’s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life   No you  think  I am pro abortion. I know I'm not. I am neutral if anything. I don't deceive myself into anything, you want to believe I am so you can preach. Even if I was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right. I stand up for life especially those already born. I stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start.   . I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I    No you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours. Because you don't like my opinion you assume I am an awful person.    You condone murder….I never called you a racist   You said I had the same opinion as Hitler and Margaret who are racist. So yes you did.   I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And….you are judging me…   No you're not. You are trying to warp my opinion and claim I am a bad person because of it. Your opinion is not  right  to everyone. Just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth. You just offend people by dismissing anything they say. You haven't exposed me. My opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it. I never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion.   I point out what you say that are untruths    They're not untruths, you believe they are. Just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong.   Why do you quote a book you don’t believe in?   Not once have I quoted the Bible. Perhaps say when? Didn't think you could...   You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period….live with it accept the label take it as your own.   Again your opinion is not fact. You  think  I am pro-abort it doesn't make it true.    I am not however handing my posts in to be graded….so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work….I live a full life and when I get on here….I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper ….it would be correct.   Great, I study work and have a 8 month old. I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly.   You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie….I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know…   I haven't lied once. You constantly lie, I pointed out every lie. All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate. I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. I work in this field idiot. Nurse/midwife mean anything to you?   This is your worldview…and explains what I said all along…why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.   It doesn't explain anything. I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. I certainly would never love you. Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right. Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life.   Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   Huge difference. I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. You tell me I am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. You place no actual evidence just your opinion. Your opinion is NOT fact.   You said two things in your post…………you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks….and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Ever heard of reading? It will do your argument good. They feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and I think abortion should happen before that. Honestly, you liar, I said what about 30 times? 24 week abortions are wrong.   So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain….or 24 weeks when obviously it can’t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.  Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw…you don’t.   Yes it is 12-14 weeks. Like I said all along. What the hell are you talking about? I said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks. I know my position. I swear because I want to. I like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word. Yes I know when. The fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester, again I've said that all along.

"1) And yet, half the people here were talking about how it's the woman's choice ONLY. The argument people ALWAYS make are that it's ""the woman's body.""  Interesting.  2) I actually can't agree with this. Rape is more iffy of course, but I don't think the child should have revenge taken out on them for being raped. The father who raped the women should suffer: not the child.  I somewhat understand that point, but I don't think it makes anything right.  I also think incest isn't much of a reason (Unless you're talking about the pedophillia related incest...) unless the women is AGAIN needing it for medical reasons. But consensual incest shouldn't equal death.  I don't condone incest, but it's a lesser evil to other things.  3) I can understand it if the baby has a deformity that WILL actually hurt them in the future.   5) the others; not much to argue I guess.

"So a husband and wife that don't want children can never have sex.... Contraceptives fail.   So two people who don't want children can not get married - lack of sex is a slam dunk claim for divorce or annulment. You are required to fulfill your marital duties or your partner can divorce you in almost every state. In addition a healthy sex life is cited by almost all marriage councilors as vital to maintaining a healthy marriage.   So how would a childless (by choice) couple be acting irresponsibly? In addition what is the difference to you?  Either they are going to have sex and and abortion (if they get pregnant), or they are going to abstain so as not to take the risk of getting pregnant if abortion is made illegal.   Guess what - either way, no child is ever born. That couple has decided not to bring a child into this world under any circumstances. Personally I don't think they should have to go their whole lives without having sex.

"They can have sex, but they must be prepared to deal with the result of it. Since when was sex the only thing that kept together a marriage? The purpose of marriage is to start a family, which includes supporting each other in BOTH good times and BAD. If you aren't trying to start a family then GTFO :)  A childless couple isn't acting irresponsibly if they are prepared to take responsibility if they have sex.

"Abortion is immoral to anyone with a heart and a sense of what is right and wrong. But our law in America allows a mother to kill her unborn child, as long as she hires it done. If she does it herself she may face being charged with taking a life. Our laws are whishy washy about this. They do not give the unborn personhood and protection, they stand on the principle that its the womans body and then they stipulate when she can have the abortion. Science is clear to when human life starts....and it does not start after nine months of pregnancy.

"I support what you say...but I would add this....when a child is concieved...there is nothing potential about it. It is already a living human being.  And I would ask you to think about the rape and incest clause in your position.  Let me ask you this.........if you believe a human life starts at conception, how is death right for even a child of rape? If you walked into a nursery full of babies and the nurse told you that one out of the twentys mother was raped...would you be able to pick that child out? Life is life and although rape is a violent act...so is abortion. So rape is the first wrong....and then on top of that abortion is another. The woman can live with two crimes. That is the same as incest. If you are pro life that means you value ALL LIFE, not just some.  If you are pro-choice and think that abortion should be legal even though you think its gruesome and wrong.....then you are not pro-life. Being pro-life is being against abortion period...unless the woman is dying on the table...and then in most cases both can be saved.

"Abortion:  When life becomes subjective, and a killing an option.   Since when is it acceptable for people say that because it's not 'quite human' we can just do whatever the heck we want with it?  The logic of something needing to PROVE that it has a right to live is just sick. Why is it that we get to define when it's okay to exterminate something?  Why is it okay to kill an unborn child, period? It might be understandable in some situations, but it doesn't make the choice RIGHT.  I LOVE how a person can go to jail for killing their household pets, but then it's suddenly perfectly okay to kill an unborn child because it hasn't met someone's standards of ""It deserves to livee~""  I can support a person's decision on the matter when it is completely necessary, but all the people who think abortion is all right and good is just sick :/

"Abortion is taking the life of a living human being. We see society up in arms about animal rights and animal abuse. Isn't abortion really the worst case of child abuse you can think of? Every abortionists task is to dismember, kill in any way possible...the living human child in the womb. Death is the only goal. The fetus might be small but nevertheless science says it is human and it is alive. What is it called when you take someones life without their permission? Isn't this murder? If you defend the womans choice to kill saying it is her choice....then should you enslave her by putting restrictions on when the killing takes place? Thus late term abortions should be legal if you are pro-abortion. When does her right to body sovereignty end?   I am all for the right of women to choose but when that choice kills another living human being that right should not exist. The living human growing inside her body is not part of her. It has its own bodily systems, its own DNA, fingerprints etc.

"It is neither right nor wrong. I agree that the latest time to have an abortion should be reduced. In the UK it currently stands at 24 weeks, which is also an age a baby can survive.   I think it's dependent on the situation of the pregnancy. If the child's going to be brought up into a life of poverty, abuse and just be bloody miserable well what kind of an existence is that? I also agree when a child has severe deformities or disabilities or an instance or rape (because of religion raped children as young as 7 have had to give birth which is no life for the baby or the mother). Even discounting these things it's still a woman's choice.  At what point do you consider it to be killing a human life can I ask? Is it once an embryo has implanted or earlier (contraception)?  My main concern with anti-abortionists is that they don't consider the problem of over-populating. If no one had an abortion could you imagine all the extra people there would be populating the planet? We would be in a massive state of poverty, much more drastic than we see now.

"Another moral relativist......sigh....  If there is nothing wrong with abortion then how can you say abortion is wrong after 24 weeks? My neice was born at 23 weeks and last year graduated from college. Although it was a long road...she is normal, in fact she is brilliant and graduated with over a 4.4 grade point. To say...that 24 weeks is the cutoff time is wrong. But then...tell me cattiscus...is abortion wrong? And just to let you know.....without intervention no baby could survive birth without help. One who is born earlier than 40 weeks just might need additional help.  Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy. They say the happiest people live in poorer countries. You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?

Louise Brown the first test tube baby was NOT APART OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE WAS CONCEIVED. She began her life in a petri dish. She was a human being from conception.

He states, ""It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermaozoan and the resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.""   Dr. Keith Moore's text on embryology, referring to the single-cell zygote says, ""The cell results from fertilization of an oocyte by a sperm and is the beginning of a human being. He also states, ""Each of us stated life as a cell called a zygote.""  Dr. Keith Moore, the Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 2d ed. (Philadelphia, Penn)  J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics (New York : McGraw Hill) In their work on biology and obstetrics, state, “The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.”  Dr. Louis Fridhandler, in the medical textbook “Gametogenesis to Implantation Biology of Gestation,” vol.1, ed. N.S. Assau (New York: Academic Press) refers to fertilization as “that wondrous moment that marks the beginning of life for a new unique individual.”    Doctors, E.L. Potter and J.M Craig write in Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed. (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers) “Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition.”  These doctors tesified before a United States Senate Committee on life.   Dr. Alfred Bongioanni, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.  He said, “I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life….I am no more prepared to say that these early stages of development in the womb represents an incomplete human being than I would be to say that prior to the dramatic effects of puberty….is not a human being. This is human life at every stage.”  Dr Jerome LeJeune, professor of genetics at the University of Descartes, Paris France. He is the doctor who discovered the chromosome pattern of Down syndrome. He says” after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. This is no longer a matter of taste or opinion and not a metaphysical contention; it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning at conception.”  Professor Hymie Gordon, Mayo Clinic: “By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.”  I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts...but would it really matter or affect your views on abortion?   Could you just answer this one question for me. What is the goal of every abortionist?

"Do you actually read anything anyone types? I said babies as young as 22 weeks have survived hence I think they need to lower the gestation period.    without intervention no baby could survive birth without help   Seriously? Woman have been giving birth on their own for thousands of years. People still do. Gone are the days in America and the UK where you would crouch down in a field and push you're little sprite out. But more and more woman are opting for a natural intervention free home birth. And that's JUST in developed countries. In poorer countries they generally just get on with it.   Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life?   I'm not, the mother of the child is. And if she can't feed herself let alone provide for a child and she decides to abort that's her choice and perhaps a sensible one.   You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?   When did I say no one has a right to live?

Nor do I make a choice for anyone to abort. Why are you blaming me for every abortion a woman decides to have because I believe she has the right to that choice? You have read way too much into a small paragraph I wrote. I simply gave reasons why a woman might choose to abort and supported that. I don't remember saying ""HEY YOU THERE! ABORT YOUR BABY IT MIGHT BE FAT!"".   What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?   What? I've never made a choice for anyone to live or die or wanted/had the right.   It is a scientific fact that the sperm in a male is human, t is a fact that the eggs in a female is human   Does that mean if someone masturbates they are aborting a human life? Does that mean when a woman menstruates she is aborting a human life? They are not human until they meet, implant and develop.    I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts   Stop talking to me about conception, I've had a child I know how it works.   What is the goal of every abortionist?

"Yeah sure, I'm pro-choice... pro-choice in the sense that the choice is made when the soon-to-be mother chose to act irresponsibly and have unprotected sex.   So many liberals out there try to paint this idealistic picture that you can make stupid decisions without any real consequences, but that's simply not true. When you have unprotected sex, a baby is conceived. At that moment, whether the baby has a pumping heart or not, it becomes a mother's natural and personal responsibility to do what is best for the baby. That could mean one of many options, such as raising the baby yourself, putting it up for adoption, or any number of alternatives. But I will tell you, as basic human decency should tell you, that anyone arguing that the termination of that baby is what's best for the baby is wrong in the most perverse way conceivable.   You chose to act irresponsibly. Now you must face the consequences, and just because you don't want to does NOT give you the right to terminate the existence of a potential human being.  Now, of course there are cases of rape and/or incest conceptions. In these cases, I do not feel that the mother should be forced to carry a child she does not deserve to have. She did nothing wrong, and should not be forced to carry the offspring of her rapist. But at the same time, I still believe that life begins at conceptions, and at that point it become a moral judgment for the mother to make. Do you believe in giving life to another human being, filling it with opportunity to make a name for himself or herself, or do you believe that you'd like to deliver children following consensual and natural intercourse between a man and a woman? At that point, the government should have nothing to do at all with the mother's say; she is no longer the irresponsible one, but rather the victim of a gruesome and despicable crime.

"I am aware that your arguments were for someone else. However, I have a couple remarks about your arguments that I would like to share with you…   Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy.    What about the victims of rape? Should young girls risk their own lives for something they did not even consent to?    What makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies?    Death penalty gives us the right to decide whether someone dies or lives. At war, soldiers constantly decide whether innocent enemy soldiers and civilians should live or die. So, human beings are given the right to kill others.   I could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts...but would it really matter or affect your views on abortion?    You did not state any proof. You only quoted doctors who agree with you.   I have one last question: Do the rights of an embryo outweigh the rights of woman?

"Ok what about women who are raped? This is a violent act for sure. But are two acts of violence better than one? I think abortion is a a violent way to kill a living human being. It is not given a sedative...it is ripped, burned and dismembered while the heart beats, when it quite possibly is moving. So how is the act of rape the new living childs fault? If you walked into a nursery in a hospital and the nurse told you that one out of the ten babies theres mother was raped...do you think you could pick it out? No....it has just as much right to life as the child whose mother was not raped. The mother who was raped not only will remember the rape, but the day she...took it upon herself to kill another living person. So if you value life........you value all life and you give it a chance.   You bring up the death penalty.....I am not pro-death penalty...I do believe in prison however...and not prisons with television, internet, and work out rooms.   I did give proof some of the top doctors around the world, researchers...I mean what more do you want? Many of these doctors testified in front of the Senate on when life begins.   And your last question.....  I believe that women know when they have sex they might become pregnant, even if they take precautions. I believe that when a life is started...that that life should be allowed to be born. Nine months is not that long when you know it can save another living persons life. There is always adoption. What is nine months...compared to killing?   This is about doing what is right, not only for the woman but the life growing inside her...that she help start. I do not believe woman should have the right to kill.   You however believe that she does, because IT IS HER BODY. And that right should not be taken away or controlled by anyone else. So let me ask you this......  If the woman wanted to abort in the ninth month, eighth month this would and should be her right.....you certainly would not want her to be enslaved by a baby even in late term........right?   You cant have it both ways.

"Murder is a legal definition. It is the unlawful killing of another human being. Thus Abortion is not Murder. Shooting a burglar is ""taking someone's life without permission"" however that is not murder either.   The right to bodily sovereignty should be absolute. What right is more basic that control over our own body. You have the right not have an operation, or medical care or drugs. You also have the right not to forcible donate blood, or organs, or risk your life to save another.   All pregnancy carries risks to life and health, the fetus uses the mother's blood and organs. She has a right to stop their use. Can she abort in the 9th month? No, but she should have the right to evict. She has control of HER body, not the fetuses.

"It's ironic that a woman can hire someone to kill her unborn, but should she do it herself, be charged with a crime. Why is this?   The fetus was once recognized as a person in our country but after 1973 it lost its identity and was put up on the chopping block, the bullseye was placed on every unborn fetus's forehead.   You talk about bodily sovereignty....I would assume you mean the right for a woman to abort at any time during the pregnancy since she certainly keeps her own body throughout the term. This means any woman because she has sole ownership of her body can decide what to do with it, even kill in the ninth month. Am I right? Is that what you are saying?  Pregnancy is not dangerous to 99% of those doing it. Less than 1% of ALL WOMEN getting abortions do it because of health issues. And in most case both mother and baby can be saved. So most woman abort because of social issues.   Having a baby is a natural thing to do. Many women do not even go to doctors to be watched and have no problems at all. So don't make the statement that it carries risks above and beyond what pregnancy implies. How many woman die a year in childbirth compared to those who have successful pregnancies? Not many.  You are saying two things in your statement. She owns her body, but she doesn't. Can she abort in the 9th month? NO..........but she should have the right to abort. Abortion kills. If that is what she wants to do, to kill it even in the ninth month, what right do you have then based on what you have said here.....to deny her the right?

"Funny that for hundreds of years abortion was considered murder. Even today if a woman kills or tries to kill her unborn she can be tried. And if someone else kills or tries, they can be prosecuted and go to prison. Scott Peterson...killed that which you say is not a person that deserved to live.   You talk about body sovereignty......then you cant ever take it away...which means you are for allowing late term abortions. You certainly would not want to enslave the woman carrying a nine month old unborn that she decided to kill at the last minute.   Right?

"If someone says they are pro-choice even though they would never get one themselves...that is the same as being pro-abortion, because to the life in the womb, it makes a lot of difference how someone views THEIR LIFE.

"it is imoral because it kills a person and every man is created equal also if the mother is a person who would actually be so irresponible as to have unprotected sex when she doesnt want a child then she should have to bear that punishment and should be able to eventually give her child up to adoption

"Take this hypothetical.   A woman, her child and a doctor are out hiking in no mans land and they have an accident (a fall lets say). The child is injured. He needs a blood transfusion and the mother and child are the same type (the doctor is not).   The doctor explains the risks to the mother - the child needs a lot of blood and he has no way to measure how much is being taken... there is a risk she will loose too much blood and die.  She agrees  He hooks her up, so she is supporting the childs life. After 10 minutes she is starting to feel lightheaded, and gets scared. She decides she doesn't want to do this anymore - she has 2 other children at home that need her.  Does she have the right to unhook herself? The child will surely die. Of course she does, it's legal, and nobody has ever tried to make it illegal. Even after agreeing, and being hooked up, she can change her mind.   So if a women gets pregnant, and the fetus is hooked up to her, why does she have to stay hooked up? At some point between her and the fetus the umbilical is part of her body. Does she not have the right to disconnect it if she feels she is not up to going through with it?  Why would a women be legally required to keep her fetus alive by allowing it access to her body, but has no legal requirement that she keep her child alive after it is born (even if there is 0 risk to her life)? A women has a right to not have her body used by someone else.
",1
"She has a right to unhook herself...but she is not slaughtering the child. The child might die might not....nature takes it course.  The fetus in the womb is not dying on its own its fine. The mother pays someone to kill it. This is totally different.   So since you are pro-abortion....I assume you are pro-abortion since you do give the woman the right it is her body.....to kill it even after nine months.  Got one for ya. The woman is in scheduled for a csection in one week. She gets scared and decides that she does not want the baby. Is perfectly acceptable for her to kill it at nine months?  The woman took the risk that she might get pregnant. If she did not want a baby she should not have had sex, or done something to prevent it like sterilization.   And for your information the baby is not part of the mother. It has its own DNA, bodily systems, heart, circulatory system, fingerprints. If the baby is part of the mother....do you think that she should be able to kill it after its born?
",0
"In your hypothetical, the woman is not aware of the impending accident. If a person goes hiking, they aren't expecting of an accident to occur, or they would not have undertaken it in the first place. Pregnancy is different because it requires sex which is a decision that everyone knows may result in pregnancy. Now you may think, ""Taking a hike in no man's land is also a decision that includes risk"" and you'd be right. But I believe this is where the debate breaks down to individual opinion. I am of the opinion that when a person becomes a parent (by deliberate decision or otherwise) they are responsible for the safety of that new human. Even to the extent of risking their own lives. That is my definition of assuming responsibility for the risks. That being said, I don't think there should be laws in place to  force  people to carry thorough a pregnancy, or donate blood to their injured child. But I believe it to be immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over that of their children. Born or not.
",0
"You chose to act irresponsibly.   I got pregnant whilst using the contraceptive pill, it's not as uncommon as you think. Don't assume every person who is pregnant isn't responsible. Just to clarify I didn't abort her, I have a daughter. However I'm just using this as a point that not all accidental pregnancies are because people are stupid enough to have sex without contraception.  Now, rape and incest aren't the only circumstance that warrant abortion. Have you considered medical problems, deformities and disabilities in an unborn baby? What about a heroin addict, a alcoholic? What about someone with severe mental health problems (bi-polar, schizophrenia, BPD)? How about a homeless person? Do you think it is okay in these cases?  I don't think any situation should dictate whether a Mother decides to proceed with a pregnancy. It's how the mother (or doctor)  perceives  the circumstance of her pregnancy. If she feels the unborn child would have a negative life or her life would be impacted seriously (not superficially) then she has the right to terminate her pregnancy.
",1
"I respectfully think you are wrong.  Hiking is not dangerous really....mountain climbing on the other hand is. You take risks to do it. This is taking responsiblity for your actions...even if the risks you took backfired and became reality. And this is the case for intercourse between a man and a woman. THE RISK IS ALWAYS THERE....unless the woman or the man is sterile. If a woman has sexual intercourse with a man who was wearing protection....and that protection broke....how do you think she would feel? Anxious? Worried? If a woman who takes the pill had sex with a man...and later learned she forget to take one the day before...how would she feel? Worried? Sure she would....because mistakes happen...but that does not change the risk factor that she took. The risk was there...and human error, condom malfunctions can happen. How is that the fault of the new life they both created? It is unfortunate, but nevertheless, the life got started.   I dont think it should be individual opinion....it should be what the facts state. And it is a fact that at conception that which is living in the womb is a human being. Now its small, but that does not change its state. A little ant working hard on a hill....has all it needs to live....its small...but the workings of his bodily system works. And a fetus however small...has the same qualities...but is human. The heart starts at around twenty days...and every day grows and something develops. The issue is...does anyone have the right to kill a living human being without its concent. We have people here who are against killing animals for food, but they are pro-abortion and believe killing humans is obviously more moral. Figure that one out.   If you say they are responsible..is the responsible thing to do is kill it? How responsible is that? Do you think that two wrongs make a right?   You say there should be no laws to enslave the woman, that she should NOT be forced to carry a baby to full term. That means in your statement that you also would condone abortion in the ninth month. So don't come back and say........""ooops...now I don't mean that...only until its viable.."" And gee when is viablity and what does that matter....the woman does not want it...and by your own statement should be allow to kill it whenever she wants. Anythink less as i said would enslave her and FORCE HER TO DO WHAT YOU SAY, NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO...in this case our government. How humane is your statement really? Donating blood does not kill anyone.   And in the United States we can really force people to give blood. When someone is arrested for drunk driving...most often they have to give blood. Denying it would really be an admission of guilt and the arresting officer can use it as evidence.  I don't get that you think its immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over their childs, yet believe the mother can kill her child while it is in the womb. ????????  Yours is certainly not the Republican stance thats for sure.

"( Headdesk )  I hate these For/Against debates about abortion. Abortion is NOT one sided! Both radical sides of the argument are full of idiocy! Which of course is why I have a totally neutral opinion. Abortion is totally okay up until a certain, and totally unacceptable after a certain point.
",1
"Abortion is one sided, it is either right or wrong...there can be no neutrality. It is either moral to kill the fetus or its not. Why do you sit the fence?   If a woman has the right to her body as pro-aborts maintain...then abortion should be legal until the childs natural birth....nine months. You say its unacceptable.....at a certain point. Why?
",0
"Nothing is one sided. There is good and evil, but mostly gray. There is neutrality in  everything . How can you say there is no neutrality? That's naive.  I don't sit the fence, I say the radical opinions are idiotic, and it's foolish to not think they are. To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.   Why do I say that? Well, simple: humans cannot judge humanity with our mere senses. The fact that we can't is the reason racism and fascism and sexism exists in the first place. You can't judge humanity by yourself and neither can I. Nobody can.  But we're supposed to be beyond that sort of thing. Open-thought and technology accelerate us as a race. We're better then to take radical sides anymore.   With that said, what constitutes a human being? Most would agree that a consciousness, a soul, constitutes a human being. We can't measure a consciousness without machines, but we can still do it.   If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.   It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat: just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human. It has no consciousness, and therefore it has no soul.   You cannot measure it's soul without measuring it's consciousness, so you cannot presume that it has a soul before it has a consciousness, but you  can  presume that is has a soul during and after it has a consciousness because you can measure it's consciousness.  Therefore, abortion is moral up until the fetus develops a consciousness. Afterwards, it is a human being and cannot be aborted. If it is aborted at that point, it is murder. Before then, it's not.   To say that one radical side is right over the other is foolish. Both sides are illogical and presumptuous. Neutrality is the only logic and morality.

"So are some rapes good?  There is only one truth.  If there is an car accident and there are ten observers who are interviews by the police....there are ten different accounts to the story. That does not mean that there are ten ways it happened. There is only one way it happened and one truth.   The truth is the truth even if we can't see it.   What is radical about saying that abortion is wrong? It once was murder in America it was not radical back then. Does morality change? Is pedophelia wrong? Is there gray area in that?  What Hitler did...was that right or wrong...where is the gray area concerning the ovens?   Were the 9-11 radicals right in taking down and killing all those on 9-11?   You said something completely contradictory here....""To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.""  You say its wrong....but its right. If you say the woman has the right to kill because it is her body...then you cant deny her this right throughout the entire pregnancy. Which means that you are killing way beyond the time of viability. Is the fetus less human at three months...than at nine? If you are pro-choice...then the answer to this would not make a difference.   Humans judge humanity all the time....our police, teachers, clergy, court systems, parents. We all judge. You are judging me by the statements I make.   I do not need you to tell me what is right and wrong, or anyone for that matter. I do not believe that it takes a village to raise a child. I believe we are responsible for what we say and do, that we are capable to decide for ourselves.   What is a human being?    http://www.thefreedictionary.com/human   It is a fact that the human being in the womb is alive before the abortion...is dead after the abortion. The human is killed. It is not an animal....a rock......it is human and has all the characteristics of a human being...even at the embryonic stage. A human is a human...whether alive or dead. This Cassie Anthony murder trial....Kaylee was found in skeletal form, nevertheless they were human remains. That which is in the womb...whether at one month, or nine....is human.  You said, ""If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.""  Humanity is not measured by consciousness. If so...the mentally retarded, those in comas, vegetative stages do not deserve it and can be treated like you say.... like masses of soulless meat. A hearless and barbaric statement to make.....  How do you know when a sould inhabits the body? In Christian scriptures....God controls this ...""before I formed you I knew you."" For you to say when a body has a soul.....is impossible. Are you god?  And if you are a humanist....why are you even mentioning souls....?  ""It's a mass of meat until it exhibits brain waves for the same reason a severed arm is a mass of meat: just because it's made of human flesh and cells doesn't make it human. It has no consciousness, and therefore it has no soul.""  Mass of meat? Are you a butcher or something? LOL   To say that those who are unconscious are not human have no soul.....that is insane and not scientific at all.   Just curious what you think about these...  Abortion to purify the races. (Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood, hated blacks and targeted them through abortion. Hitler admired her.)  Abortion for profit. Women selling their fetal body parts for cash.  Abortion because something is wrong with fetus...wrong sex, hair lip...etc  Abortion to control the population.   Like I said you are all over on this. Abortion is right, no its wrong when.....and when that time is you cant pinpoint. No one could do this while the human is growing in the womb.   Do you know when they can detect measureable brain waves in the womb? Why should this matter to you?       http://www.buzzle.com/articles/ brain-development-in-fetus.html     So all of a sudden at some time (you cant pinpoint) abortion is wrong. BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID EVERY WOMAN HAS THE RIGHT TO OWN HER BODY AND DECIDE FOR HERSELF?   As I said.....your comments are morally baffling...make no sense.

"I said there is good and evil and mostly gray, don't mince my words. Rape is one of the few things that is unconditionally evil. But even rape has neutrality in it. Let's say you rape someone as evil as Hitler, a murderer of innocent people. Is that evil? No. Fighting evil with evil is not evil, it is neutral.   There is only one truth, yes, but my point is that you don't know what that one truth is. Human perception is the only thing we can run on because it is the only way we can see things. You can't, I can't. Therefore, you cannot make assumptions of what the truth is by putting in place of it your opinions. My abortion belief is not opinionated in any way, and that's what separates me from you.  It's a radical thing to say abortion is wrong under any circumstance because the idea that it is takes away freedom from certain people. Is taking away freedom right when people don't all share you ideas? No. And yes, there is a gray area in pedophilia you ding-dong. Have you no imagination? Here's a scenario: You are an adult, and you make great friends with a teenager; one day, you fall in love with him/her and they feel mutually back despite you being much older then them. Is that love wrong? Just because there is an age gap? Not necessarily. Not all pedophiles are evil perverts just because you think they are.   What Hitler did WAS wrong, did I dispute that it wasn't? But in fact, it was gray in some areas. Why? Because he saved Germany. He did more evil then good, but in the end, he still was some gray despite being a lot of evil.  The 9/11 bombers were wrong to, but you have to realize, they were brought up in a third world country where they had nothing, where they starved to death whilst people like American's were getting hundreds of divorces every day. Yes, they killed people, but they suffered and died for their actions. Even in those acts, there was balance, despite being mostly evil.  It's meant to be contradictory. I don't believe in either radical, I trust in the balance between the two which I explained. Why are you arguing as if I believe in both of them at the same time? I'm not pro-choice, I'm just on this side of the debate. The fact is that a fetus isn't human at a certain stage and completely human after a certain point.  Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.  You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.   I don't care what the dictionary says. Use your own definition for a human being. What separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness, a soul. Some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality, consciousness, and soul.  Just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human. A mushroom is alive. Is is it wrong to step on a mushroom? No, it has no consciousness. A severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed), is it wrong to cook and eat it? No. It has no consciousness. What about a  human  finger? Is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)? NO. To say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy.  Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness. You think the mentally retarded have no consciousness? They do. They feel and think and have a soul. People in commas are sleeping. For a long time. They think and feel and have a soul.   Vegetable people are not human. They brains are dead. They feel nothing, think nothing, and have no soul. Only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going. They are vegetables. Are vegetables people? No. The person they were died with their brains. So yes,  vegetable people are soulless piece of meat .  I know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness. We have machines to tell this. What  you  do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness.   Also, yes, I am God. I am a Pantheist. But that has nothing to do with this debate.  If humanists mention souls, then apparently I'm not a humanist. Duh.  No, I am not a butcher, but anyone can be a butcher if they want. The point is that masses of meat aren't human, dummy. Just because it's made of human cells doesn't make it human.  Just because something is unconscious doesn't mean it doesn't have a consciousness. So no, I am not being unscientific at all, nor grotesque and insane. You're insane for mincing my words together and taking everything I say in a manner that it does not mean.  Abortion to purify races isn't right if that's the intent. But the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness isn't wrong, the intent is wrong.   Stem cell research is very beneficial for medical research. Though, killing a conscious fetus and selling it's body parts is immoral and disgusting.   That intent is wrong in some cases, but only the intent, not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious.   Once again, the intent is wrong, but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious isn't.  I'm all over on what? Abortion is right when the fetus isn't a human. Once it's human, it's wrong. What's complicated about that? I know when a fetus is human, I can prove it. You can't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness.   Yes, I do, you do not need to provide a link.  No, I did not say that, I gave it as an example of one of the extreme points. I've already said 3 or 4 times that I do not agree with either extreme point, I'm just on this side out of coincidence, and now because you're zealously pro-life.  No, my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense. What you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense. What is wrong with you?

"Somepeople do not agree with what is evil. We are disagreeing with abortion here. I see it as evil, you see it as a good. Where is the gray area?  And rape......in your opinion it is wrong...but what about other cultures?   And Hitler, he killed those who thought inferior and weak. Murder has always existed. But peoples opinions differ on whether the murders are warrented. There are those who think our participation in the ME wars were wrong that they served no good. Others disagree. So evil is in the eye of the beholder. So when you say fight evil with evil.....its subjective, because people might not agree which side is right and which side is wrong. Yet you say there is only one truth. How do you determine what is truth on your own? And should everyone be subjected to YOUR way of thinking?  It is not radical to say something is wrong.  And stop calling me names...you look foolish. Your example is sick. You fall in love with a child.....???? A child is a child...and it is never right to have sex with a child if you are an adult. There are laws to prevent this from happening...to keep children safe..from your way of thinking. Love can destroy people, families and communities.   You said, ""Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.""  FActs about abortion? I doubt that. What facts do you know just curious.   ""You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.""   The fact is that which is growing in the womb is a human being. The abortionist goal is to kill that which is growing. That is a biological fact.   So if you base your morality on facts.....why are you pro-abortion? That speaks volumes about how you come up with what is moral and what is not. You yourself think you are god.......so in your mind, sex with children could be a good thing, cheating, lying and stealing could also be moral.....even child abuse.  I find it sad that in your post you defend evil. Where is the balance in that?  ""Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness.""  For people who live godless lives it might. For people who do not consider all human life sacred....for those who are moral relativists it might. I find it sad that you eliminate groups of people who are living but unconscious. That they lose the right to live while in this state. People who are in comas, under for surgeries...even sleeping is a form of being unconscious. So because a child is in the womb...does not mean they are not aware of what is going on especially physically. When I was pregnant I used to push in on my baby....and prode it until it moved....aware of my touch.   Your view on life is sad. Vegetable people are nothing? You are so so cold. I feel sad for you really, that your worldview IMO of course is so empty. That you would compare a living person to meat. What a cold way of putting it.

"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!

"So basically you're saying: ""Let's be neutral about this issue and accomplish absolutely nothing. Taking a stand on what you believe in just causes problems no matter who you are, so it's best to just pull a Switzerland and not do anything."" Not only that, but you say that neutrality is the best morality as well? So when you have kids and they hit puberty, because of your ""neutrality"" mentality you'll tell them to do whatever they'd like, regardless of what's smart, responsible, or sensible? Good luck making tough decisions in life, my friend.  You seem to base your argument for neutrality off of logic. You say that neutrality is logical. I disagree. In an earlier post, I made a spirited argument of why logically, abortion is wrong, because according to the laws of reason that govern this earth, every action has a consequence, and to say that just because you don't want to face that consequence does not mean you don't have to.

"That's not what I said. Typical... turning my words into something they are not. How polite of you. What I said is that neutrality is logical because this world is made of almost nothing but it. If you kill a man who attacks you for no discernible reason, how good or evil is that action if he is a devoted, loving father? The fact is that there is little good and evil in the world, something that churchmouse did not seem to understand, thus my explanation of it and neutrality to her.  What you don't understand is that to be neutral isn't to not make a decision. To be neutral is to be aligned in between two extremes. Just because you are aligned in between two extremes does not mean you do not make decisions based off of your alignment. You're not thinking of neutrality, you are thinking of laziness. Or stupidity, perhaps. And for the record, you don't know how I treat my own children. How I treat them has nothing to do with abortion, nor my point on neutrality.   You are correct, you did make an argument of logic, though what you forgot to include in said argument was a wide variety of points that prove that abortion are wrong. If you are saying that abortion is wrong only because it stops people from facing the consequences of unprotected sex, then you are forgetting that there are  far  too many reasons for and against abortion for that to be your leading point.

"If you are a woman and have a brain you know that any birth control method can fail, unless she has had a hysterectomy. So the woman takes the chance, it is her decision, HER RESPONSIBILTY. It's not always about stupidity...but that does not chance the responsiblity part or the fact that says....a human life starts at conception.   Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion? Is the innocent child in the wombs life less than one in a womb who got there by a mother who was not raped? Do you think that if you walked into a hospital nursery and you were told that one babys mother had been raped...that you would be able to pick it out? Why does two acts of violence make sense? So the woman goes through the rape and then knowing she killed the child inside her. Do you know how mothers would cope with this extra trauma?   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die? Wow...how compassionate and materialist you are. ARe you perfect in appearence? Lets abort babies because they have problems.......Hitler had the same idea did you know that? He believed in killing the weak, the dredges of society. Again you are blaming the unborn for the sins of the parent. I have personally seen drug babies...and while they have a hard time at first...they can be saved and they can lead normal lives. You are making excuses for the killing.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks...the woman who wants to finish school, the woman who does know who the father is, the woman who does not want another child of that sex?   You know it is sad that you feel this way...that you would be so judgemental that to solve a problem you have to kill a living human being. That you would speak for another human who cant speak for themselves, and choose death. You are choosing death...for all the ""what-if's""  What right do you have to determine how someone MIGHT LIVE?   What if you were poor....and the government said that everyone who made less than a certain amount couldn't have a child, that if you got pregnant you would have to abort because if you had one it would be a burdon on society. Would you be ok with that?  What did you mean by your comment....""life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)""? What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time?

If I proclaim that destroying a fetus is murder (which I believe it is), you'll call that argument ""full of idiocy.""

"only 19% of polled people believe ""abortion is wrong no matter what""  I'm assuming at least 4% of those don't understand specific diseases that account for around 1-3% of abortions performed because the fetus is grotesquely misformed and birthing it will result in the fetus' death within minutes and potentially the mother's death if not aborted.  So yeah, 15%.  The problem is for you, most don't know about abortion, what it actually entails, why it is actually performed, in what numbers, and what women did before it was available.  Once they know these numbers; that before it was legal there were just as many abortions but instead they were performed in alleys and basements, that the vast majority that have abortions do it in the first 2-4 weeks, that the vast majority also were either raped or are having an aborition due to some medical issue, or that the women you and your ilk constantly demonize, the ones who casually decide on this course of action make up such a low percent you might as well outlaw instances of albino,  then even those answering ""oh yeah whatever, I'm pro-life"" would actually change to pro-choice.  So yeah, 15% and once again it's religion using a wedge issue to garner more power from idiots like youself.  Hey, more people died of starvation last year than abortion, when are you going to start sending money to Africa you asshole?

"Please tell me what is ""full of idiocy"" about this argument.   Based on the laws of reason, you can't do any action without expecting some kind of consequence, good or bad. In this case, you can't have unprotected sex without expecting to get pregnant, and it is WRONG to believe that you shouldn't have to endure the consequences of your actions. If I murder someone, can I expect that I won't have to receive criminal punishment, simply because I don't want to face the consequences of my actions?   No I cannot.

"Pro-choice is full of idiocy because unlimited rights in every situation is, of course, ridiculous. You're right, you're supposed to be able to be punished for your actions if you do something stupid. To have the rights to avoid responsibility for every last mistake you make is an abandonment of logic.  Pro-life is full of idiocy because most of the time it is based on the notion that the second a sperm and egg meet and become a single complete cell, they become a human being with all of the same rights of a human being. That is an abandonment of logic.  Logical, truly moral balance is found on middle ground between the two extremes.

"But how can something be 1. alive, and 2. potentially a human being, without being considered a human being?

"So the woman takes the chance, it is her decision, HER RESPONSIBILTY   You really are a sexist pig. The male who has sex with her and impregnates takes half the responsibility for pregnancy. It's not solely a woman.   Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion   Because if a child is going to make her life more awful than what she's already experienced she has the choice to not go through that. I'm not saying you  should  abort in these circumstances but I understand entirely why people do.   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die?    You are possibly the biggest word mincer ever. I personally wouldn't abort a child on these grounds and I'm not saying people  should . But yet again I understand and sympathize with someone who does.   .Hitler had the same idea did you know that?   Stop calling and comparing me to Hitler. It's so rude.   You are making excuses for the killing.   I'm not making excuses. I'm saying I understand why woman would abort in these situations. Stop acting like I advocate death and I'm murdering people.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks   I think that's probably a very selfish reason however I don't know the woman's background maybe she has serious depression and her self esteem is low. Hence I said ""life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)"" Oh and in response to your question about I meant, I mean personally if someone were to abort because it was the wrong sex or something along those lines I'd probably think it was a bit selfish. But I wouldn't out right deny the woman the right to do so. And don't call me a hypocrite, because I still believe the woman has the right to abort under those circumstances.   What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time   This is coming from the person who believes a woman has no right to abort at all? A woman can abort for whatever reason she likes it has nothing to with me I've never led you to believe that I think only some woman can abort. And just to clarify I've already posted the scientific studies and facts on when a baby feels pain and it's brain is active, and why that is my defining limit on abortion gestation with some exception. If you couldn't be bothered to read it that's your problem.

"Your link is the second step in my argument. I'll get to it soon.   But how...   Simple, the same reason a single sperm or a single egg cell are not human beings.    It seems to me...   Well that's how it seems to you. It seems to me that just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it human.   Just because...   Actually, depending on the stage in the pregnancy, it isn't a human being when the heart isn't beating. Then again, I believe the heart starts beating after it's become a human being during the pregnancy; I'm not exactly sure of the minuet time-frame specifics of most pregnancies.   By that logic...   You're assuming I'm totally pro-abortion, which I am not. My logic is not yet fully explained to you. Very simply, do I believe that fetus in the photo is a human being? Well, I'm fairly sure it is, but I'd need a doctor with a very expensive machine to tell me whether is it or not.

"If I masterbate into a woman's vagina instead of the shower drain it's ""potential life"" as well. Yet the bible says ""it's better to spill your seed on the belly of a prostitute than to let one drop hit the dirt""  So basically it's okay to pull out, therefore it must be okay to wear a condom, therefore it must be okay to get rid of a cluster of cells (sperm's a cluster of cells just like that virus in the woman's belly before the third trimester).  Really the only lesson your silly book teaches on this is that hiring a prostitute is healthier than jacking off all the time... which I agree with by the way. If only Christians knew the bible as well as atheists I might get along better with you idiots.  Anyway, once again this is a case of religion creating a boogie man to control the masses through fear, and everyone forgets what it was like when abortion really was illegal because crazy ass stories are easier to remember than history apparently.  The only thing making abortion illegal decreases in the entire history of mankind, is the number of women who have safe abortions. It doesn't decrease the number of abortions, just the number of safe abortions.

"Give me the link again, and if it doesn't have evidence that a newly fertilized egg has a human  soul , then you're lying. Saying something is a human being based on the flesh is not scientific, meaning you're full of opinionated shit. And so is the ""scientist"".  I have obviously done far more research on this topic then you, since you are content with sitting on a radical belief. It doesn't matter if something is alive, that does not make it human. A mushroom is alive. Grass is alive. But we still step on mushrooms and mow our lawns.  You haven't been listening to my point from the beginning. You don't listen... listen listen listen. I know exactly what the pro-life stance on abortion is, but you know nothing about what my stance is, because you obviously have not been paying attention even slightly. That, or you're completely insane.  There is a moral middle ground for  everything . I am not sitting on the fence. I am not pro-abortion because I don't believe in abortion after a certain stage in the pregnancy. Who the heck am I? No one. But a doctor can tell her when her fetus has  brain waves . A doctor can tell her, therefore, when a fetus is a  conscious human being . If she cannot see the logical difference between killing something that is conscious and something that is not conscious, then I would never trust her to know what the difference is between smashing a rock and killing a newborn baby. So no, it's not personally what I think even a little. It's basic logic that you seem to lack or deny out of faulty religious principle.   I am going to point this out one last time about my observations over abortion:  science does not prove that a human soul beings at conception . Science does, on the other hand, prove that a consciousness emerges at a certain stage in the pregnancy. The soul is not measured by existence, it is measured by the brain, by the conscious being. To say that a human has a soul because it's flesh exists is like saying that an  ant  has a soul because it crawls on your kitchen floor, but that's not going to stop you from  murdering it with Raid .   This is very balanced thinking. The fact that I don't believe in the mother's rights after a certain point instead of at all times means I am not one-sided, like you. If I am not one-sided, then what am I? I'm in between the two radical opinions because neither of them is balanced. Pro-choice is hypocritical and pro-life is hypocritical. Both are illogical because neither factor in circumstance. You want to know why my observations of abortion are so confusingly in between? Because I factor in circumstance and humanity. You do not.   I have not once disputed that a fetus is not alive, I have disputed that it is not human until a certain point. So, I'm going to say this one last time:  you have yet to prove that a fetus is human before is has a consciousness . You dodge and you block and you spew meaningless jargon at me that has no relation to anything I'm saying. You haven't proved me wrong once;  once .  Now stop spewing crap at me and explain why a fetus,  logically , has a soul at every stage of the pregnancy, consciousness or not. Only when you can  logically  prove that a fetus has a soul before it has a consciousness that you will ever come anywhere near proving me wrong.   So far, you have said nothing that means anything towards disputing me. Maybe you're dumbfounded and not paying attention to a single word I'm saying. But I've pretty much explained it thoroughly, so if you can't get it this time, it's obvious that you're extremely slow.

"First off, I would like to remind everyone that this debate involves the morality of abortion, not the legality of abortion. Those two topics are completely different, especially since the legal system is not set up to be a perfect morality emulator.   A fetus does not have the right to life as long as it is nothing more than a product of its mother and father. When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.  Regardless, abortion is typically always a tough decision for every woman. Many find it to not be the most moral of decisions, but it is usually found to be the right decision.

"Abortion is the choice of the woman, because she has the child. It is best if at the beginning of pregnancy abortion, because that is the child is not large. Just before the birth abortion, I find it disgusting, because the child has to a large extent to be born perfect. So I think it's good as long as it is the beginning of pregnancy, but just before giving birth.

"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)

"What I just said is fact like it or not. You want to say that abortion should be legal because its her body...her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk SHE TOOK. You look silly. Our laws say that the baby is not his enough to be a part of the decision...he has no choice in the matter. Why men don't see this and storm in outrage I don't know.

Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is.   You are cold.

You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.  You are saying death should always be an option. How do you go to bat for the innocent in the womb? You don't.  You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed. Do you ever read what you post here and really really think about what you say and how it sounds. YOU YOU YOU....think   What do YOU think any aborted child in the womb would say if they could talk (hell infant babies cant talk either) and address the one who killed them, the one who presumed they would have a horrible life?   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing. LOL  You pro-aborts kill me....no pun intended.  What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.  You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved) but that it shouldnt be her responsiblity only........(what the man should pay for the killing?) you think when the baby can feel pain abortion should not be allowed.... not allowed...after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.  I know the studies...I know people who have done the studies. The fact is....that which is in the womb is human, is alive and is a growing person. Science is on the side of life and defines it in terms that are not pro-choice. Life was not concieved to kill in this way, it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb.

"""We don't even abort animals like we do our own human children""  As a former veterinary technician, I can tell you that you're quite mistaken. Many dogs and cats are brought into the vets office to be ""spayed"" in late stages of pregnancy. The pups/kits that are removed with the uterus are usually killed immediately by breaking their necks or by lethal injection. Horrific, yes it is. But beats the heck out of the alternative, having even more unwanted pets in the streets and shelters.   I don't like having to choose a side that says ""abortion is right"" because I don't think it is. But I do absolutely believe in the right of a woman to choose an abortion if she and her doctor believe it is the best choice for her. Sometimes an abortion is the lesser of two evils - and I don't think anyone but a woman and her doctor should be allowed to make that decision for her.

This is my view entirely. You can't pin point exact opinions or 'when is it murder' because it  always  depends on circumstance. If you mean gestation I can't answer that because it's purely scientific but I personally believe once a baby is a viable living age.

"Oh please....people have surgery all the time and talk about it. You are avoiding where I am taking you because your back is against the wall and you know it. No one talks about abortion because abortion is killing a living human being. That is fact. What woman wants people to know she did this?   If you value all life...the circumstances don't matter...only if the mother is dying on the table. Most people are pro-choice because they do not believe anyone should tell a woman what to do with their own bodies. Then they turn around and tell the woman she cant control it after the time they think its viable. Viability should not matter if you believe it is human and deserves the right to live.

"You forget that she's from the UK. The British don't tend to randomly share such personal information with random people, whether it's kidnehy surgery or abortion. (Yes, that stereotype was satirically intended for the purpose of pointing out that her country is different then ours.)  That's hypocritical for you to say. In fact, that's contradictory. ;) If the circumstances don't matter to you, then the circumstance of the mother dying on the table shouldn't matter either. You're a big fat hypocrite. REAL pro-life people I've talked to think the mother should  die .  Circumstance is the only thing that matters in anything, ever. If you value  all  life, then you are an idiot. If you value all  human  life, then you're supposed to treat them with empathic logic, the only logic of morality. People are numbers in the end. If you don't treat them like numbers and instead like individuals, more will be lost then gained. You can't just say that it's right to let the mother die because abortion is murder, because that, by definition, is incentive to murder. If you value all  human  life, you can't say that euthanazia is right, but letting a mother die in childbirth is euthanazia. According to your logic, you'd have to choose in between murder and murder.   And that's why circumstance is the only factor that matters.   What if a doctor like you is in that situation described above? What is he supposed to do? What he's SUPPOSED to do is abandon your false logic! It is not logic because it does not factor in the unpredictable variable that is circumstance! If you want to do the right thing, you have to think of everyone and everything as a whole, not  one  specific factor in the equation! You can't solve for x in an xy equation without also solving for y!   Your logic tries to solve for  just  x.  As you can see, that is impossible. That's why I don't agree with either radical side of this debate. If you really care about people and life, neither should you.

"Oh please....quit making excuses. People dont talk about it because its an act that kills a living human being. And it does not matter where abortion happens its the same thing. Most women do not come forth with this information because of the nature of abortion. IT KILLS. Women know what it does and they don't want to be judged. That is why so many women suffer in silence over past abortions.   I am not a hypocrite...you just don't get this issue. First of all your a man...and men are really not important in this issue...unfortunately. Most laws say after you ejaculate and implant the sperm your nothing....well unless she desides to have the baby and sues wrongfully for child support. Only then are you an issue. If your wife or girfriend get pregnant by you..........you have no say even if you want your child. And you have no idea what having an abortion is like.....or what a woman might just go through, physically or emotionally.   Your opinion would be like mine if I told a NFL player how it felt to be tackled on the field.   You losing it by calling names? Is that how you interact with people.....calling them names and using profanity. Your entire worldview is pathetic...and shows humanism for what it is....and empty worldview devoid of real happiness.   And I do not believe in human euthanazia or the death penalty.   As I said what you describe does not happen that often in the case of mothers immediately in danger of dying...except a tubal pregnancy. As I said...the life of the mother would come first. The doctor would treat the woman....and still would not have to cut the unborn apart.   If I really care about people, you mean the way you dont? I love people and I help and care for people especially people who are less fortunate than I am. It is sad that all you care about is yourself...that much is obvious. What a sad way to live.

"Ha ha ha, I'm not at all. You don't get it. I'm talking about her point of view in the UK. People don't talk about it because medical history is personal and the British are a different personality then us over medical information all together. You apparently aren't friends with many British people like I am. In the United States, you are correct to a small extent, but don't think it's the same way in the UK just because you want it to be. It's not.  Wow, you're a hypocrite AND a sexist. Ha ha, now things just got interesting. You're a hypocrite because what you said wasn't pro-life and it was contradictory to itself. You said 'circumstance doesn't matter unless the women is dying on the table'. That's hypocrisy. Hypocrite.   Also, why does my opinion not matter in the case of abortion? Because I don't feel what an abortion is like? That's a very sexist thing to say. You're right when it comes to dead beat fathers, but they wouldn't give an opinion in the first place. I have the right to my opinion and half of the decision over the abortion my wife may or may not receive for the same reason that my wife ALSO has the right to her opinion and half of the deicsion over the  kidney donation  I may or may not do! You have a problem if you think neither have those rights in that situation. In fact, you're sexist if you think I don't deserve an opinion in that situation. Sexist.   My opinion is nothing like that. How is it like that? You're saying things that have absolutely no substance... back them up. Never once have I said that I know what it's like to have an abortion or how much it feel or hurts or damages. So, what merit is this 'you have no right' argument, other then to be sexist, hm?  I called you one name in the previous comment. I called you it because you deserve to be called it. You said something that was hypocritical. So I pointed out that you are a hypocrite, because you are indeed a hypocrite. That doesn't compare to you calling me a butcher, murderer, pro-murder, illogical, humanist, pro-abortion... all of which are untrue. Making you a SUPER-hypocrite, therefore. You think I'm loosing? Really? You haven't replied to half of my big arguments because you have no counters, and so far, you have only replied with meaningless jargin that proves no point. Like now, you say my worldview is pathetic because I called you one name. How so? I called you a name that is true. It's not like I called you a cunt, which I didn't; in fact, I haven't used a single profane word to describe you.   Now, explain to me in a sensible manner why my worldview, not humanism, you namecaller, is pathetic and devoid of real happiness, without the use of senseless jargon. I believe, in relation to abortion, of a balance between two illogical and extreme beliefs. Whatever you think, I am no humanist just because you say I am, namecaller. I called you a hypocrite because you said something hypocritical. Humanism is a belief system that you assume I follow in it's entirety, which I do not. Namecaller.   You don't believe in euthanasia or the death penalty? Well, that just shows how the comment 'No circumstance matters unless she's dying' is still hypocritical. Hypocrite.   I AM NOT ARGUING IN THIS COLUMN THAT IT HAPPENS OFTEN, I AM ARGUING THAT YOU ARE NOT TRULY PRO-LIFE AND THAT THE PRO-LIFE STANCE ON ABORTION IS DISCOMPASSIONATE. Showing once again that you fail to see the real point behind my argument. Stop living in your magical world and start  reading my comments . Holy crap.  Well, you're right about that, but that doesn't make your beliefs any less illogical in relation to the grand scheme of good and evil. That's what happens when you take a radical opinion. You don't think about everyone, you just think about a specific direction of people.  I don't care only about myself. How do I only care about myself, you hypocrite? That is such a malicious thing for you to say, and it is totally untrue. You know, you're only digging your hole of hypocrisy deeper and deeper. You said I was being malicious and calling you names, and yet you're saying all these untrue things about me with no evidence. I'm calling you names I only have supporting evidence for. Hypocrite. Namecaller.  Troll . Meanie.

"Finally I forgot to ask... You believe the male should have a right in the choice of abortion. What if the male wanted an abortion and the woman didn't? I assume you wouldn't be so happy about that right then. That's part of the reason why men don't generally have a  legal say , baring in mind most woman consult with the father and come to a mutual agreement anyway. You also argue that pregnancy is entirely down the woman yet you believe she shouldn't have the final say on the child. So which is it, is the woman solely responsible for pregnancy and the child or are both sexes equally responsible?

"I can't admit that of course because I am pro-life.   Who is the authority on what pro-lifers may and may not admit?   In what circumstances do you consider abortion if any murder?   If it's murder it's murder, if it's abortion it's not murder. Situations where a life is ended for no good medical reason shouldn't be called abortions.   Or do you just think all cases of abortion are ok?   I don't think it's OK to commit murder and call it abortion.   What do you mean medical necessity?   Necessary as determined in the confidential Doctor Patient relationship.   Do you mean the less than 1% of the cases when abortion is perform to save the mothers life?   Don't get me wrong, I think it's disgusting, how often murdering a perfectly viable and healthy fetus passes for a legitimate medical procedure.   If there is nothing wrong with abortion....why don't people talk about it like its just any other kind of surgery?   Because a very young human dies, and people don't want to think about that. They want to put it out of their minds.   It is the most common surgery performed in America today   That gives me the shivers to think about.   IS THERE SOMETHING MORALLY WRONG WITH ABORTION?   No.

Mother has to many other kids?  Mother cant afford it?  Mother wants to sell fetal body parts?  Rape?   Incest?  Woman might have stretch marks?  Which one is a good medical reason for abortion? Less than 1% of ALL ABORTIONS ARE DONE ON WOMEN WHO ARE DYING. In most cases the baby can be saved.  Odd...you know its taking the life of a little human being...it gives you the shivers...you dont want to think about it......BUT YOU SAY ITS NOT MORALLY WRONG.

How long have humans existed? It's only in the last 100 years that medicine has been greatly involved in child birth. Of course babies survive without medical intervention. It's natural to not have someone constantly shoving there fingers in you to check dilation. It's natural to give birth unaided. More and more woman now, even in developed countries are choosing not to have a child in hospital or with medical assistance. Instead they opt to give birth at home naturally and without medical intervention. People in poor countries just give birth in their bed and get on with it!    and want them dead.

You just precluded your ability to quote scripture for this debate.   I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    The point is that it isn't a choice that you make. You are able to process the decision now because you have a mind. A foetus has no mind. It isn't complete, it cannot think like you can.   Killing a foetus is like killing a doll, really? since when did the world become so insensitive to teach someone to refer to an act such as abortion, as killing... a.. doll.    It's basic biology. A developing brain is less sophisticated than an adult one, or child one. You take for granted this fact, that the brain develops in stages and each stage has limitations before the progression to the next. An infant cannot understand abstract concepts. A child cannot understand sexuality. A foetus is not aware like we could consider it. It isn't a child agonising over death.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.    If you have nothing well-thought-out to say, then do not speak. This is a debate and thoughtless statements are not appreciated.  Also, learn your place. You have no possession of the female gender. Theirs is not your body to command over and their life is not yours to play fate with.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it. yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her, you be the one to watch it as it dies, if it isnt alive then why bother?   A child needs love, attention, and it needs to be wanted. Children who are neglected and abused may become criminals. They become broken so they resort to crime and display emotional problems.  Family planning allows us to prevent unwanted children from entering the world.  I feel nothing towards foetal death. It isn't a baby. A baby's death is lamentable because of wasted innocence. A foetus dying has no bitterness because it isn't a person, but a thing which may only be doted upon by those who are not educated enough to know better.   We can only see thing's as human if they breathe talk and walk? Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable. I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.   What defines humanity is a philosophical question which I assure you has few absolute answers. Biology suggests that we form in stages, with our minds truly mature in women at her late teenage years, in men at his early twenties. This suggests that you are not fully human until that point, for you are still growing into adulthood. A simpler definition would be that what defines humanity is our identity. We form an identity as we gather memories in this world and reflect upon them to grow. In either definition, a foetus isn't fully human because it is still growing and unable to have identity.

"I do not have a whole loving family, I am a foster kid, I would choose life over death an infinite amount of times.    I am sure everyone who is capable of making that choice would make the same decision as you. Fetuses are incapable of making decisions, therefor they have no say in whether or not they get aborted.   If a girl open's her legs she better be damn well ready to open them again nine months later.   The choice to engage in sexual activity is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term in the same way that the choice to engage in smoking is not synonymous with the choice to allow lung cancer to proceed without treatment.  PS: This is really sanctimonious and judgmental. Try to work on that.   If she is raped she can give her baby to a family that want's it.   Sure, she can. Or, she can get an abortion, and they can adopt a different baby from the overflowing foster care system.   yeah I know it has already been stated that there is enough Orphan's in the world, but you know what, I dare you to be the one to cut that baby from her,    How does any one person's ability to perform a medical procedure influence whether it should be permitted? Do you have the will or education to perform brain surgery? If not, should we make brain surgery illegal?   if it isnt alive then why bother?   Why do you and other pro-life advocates insist on thinking anyone is claiming a fetus is not alive? Clearly it is not inanimate or dead. It is just incapable of consciousness, therefor does not deserve the rights of a conscious individual. Under the law, killing a fetus does not count as taking the life of a person.  Alive  and  a person's life  are different concepts.   Abortion is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.   Since you later refer to abortion as the act of cutting a baby from someone, I am assuming you are one of the ones who considers abortion to be synonymous with the act of murdering a helpless infant. If so, this statement equates to 'Murdering a helpless infant is never right, but it is sometimes understandable.'   This doesn't sound right to me. Is it wrong, or not? If the end result is no different for the fetus, why would motive or circumstance make a difference?   I would laugh my head off if we had come to find out that we killed some genius who would cure cancer in an abortion.   Would you still laugh if the orchestrator of the largest genocide in history were to be aborted?

"Show me where in the bible that god forgives deliberate, planned murder.   I don't care what the Bible says God forgives and doesn't forgive. Plenty of other people don't, either.   But, just for fun:  http://www.evilbible.com/Murder.htm    If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation.   As abortion is currently legal, this is no longer an 'if' scenario. Some may say we are in dire straights as a country, but I doubt it is because the government places the rights of a conscious citizen above the interests of an unconscious fetus.   Additionally, it is judgmental and tunnel-visioned to assert that only stupid people get pregnant accidentally. Do not place yourself on a pedestal above people who find themselves in this situation.   If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world.   I think it would take a very strong mental constitution  not  to be psychologically harmed by carrying to term a pregnancy resulting from rape. I certainly admire the women who decide to do so, but women who decide not to do not deserve punishment; they deserve compassion and support because they have suffered enough.  There is no shortage of available orphans. A woman who chooses to have an abortion (for any reason, not just rape or health-related) is not cruelly ripping away some innocent stranger's dream of having a child.    When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.   Earlier, it seems you implied abortion is acceptable if carrying the pregnancy to term will harm or kill the mother. Correct me if I am wrong and I will revise. Because it is for a reason you consider valid, it is no longer murder? If the answer is yes, it is still murder, why do you allow murder in some cases but not others? If the answer is no, it is no longer murder, why should your opinion be the determining one for deciding what is a valid reason to get an abortion?  She is not really stating facts, she is rambling incoherently, getting worked up, and ignoring opposing arguments. If you are her parent, you may want look around this site and see what the average discourse consists of, for the sake of both herself and the site. She may be a little young to participate.

Two more eyes that will never see.  Two more hands that will never touch.  Two more legs that will never run.  One more mouth that will never speak.  Did you know that by day 30 you had a heart?

"There's just so many things wrong with your post... let's list them. ;)  1. I agree, human life is not something to ditch. Better it be aborted first.  2. On this issue, she's as wrong as possible  3. The bible is garbage. I would sooner trust my arguments to logic than some dogmatic fiction novel. If you had any intelligence, you would do the same.  4. We aren't a race, we're a species. Unless you're trying to say that it's only wrong for one race to get abortions... XD   5. ""Sorry nation"" is a non-cognitive opinion, therefore has no base in reality.  6. There is no shortage of orphans. Parents wanting children but can't conceive can easily adopt if they want to any time. Your argument is moot.  7. No, you're just egotistical and assume everything you personally don't approve of is your business.  8. There were no ""toes"" being stepped on. She made a logical error and I corrected her.   Wow, literally every sentence in your post made some kind of fallacy. Some even made two.   That. Is. Hilarious. ;)

"there's so many things wrong with this statement HM lets list them  1. you're ditching a life if your getting an abortion because the fedus or what ever is human and is living inside you  2. this #2 statement is totally disputable because it is an opinion  3. some people would disagree that the bibles trash and i would never trust your disputes because they are irrational  4. sorry but yet again we are the human RACE not the human species try to remember the little schooling you have please  5. ""sorry nation"" means that a large percent of people would be dead because murder is allowed  6. who are you going to adopt if all the babies have been aborted you really should have thought that one through  7. actually it is a persons rightful business when they care for and or are related to something in a way and many people care for children no matter what therefore it is our business plus it is a public voting matter  8. i think of this as the Internet where you can express yourself in any way you on one hand seemed to be getting pretty angry therefore i would say your toes were stepped on  9. you do not have to write perfectly on line and XD isn't a literal term therefore you used a double negative in your ""speech"" if you would call it that  10. how would you like it if you were aborted your mother weather you know it or not loved you enough not to abort you

"1. I was talking specifically about placing a child into the adoption system. Learn to read. I don't have a problem with ditching something. The problem as I see it is when a mother would sooner impose a life of lovelessness and misery onto her child than to just terminate it's life.   If YOU personally think it's okay to make other persons miserable so long as it keeps your conscience clear, fine, but that makes you an egotistical asshole to me.  2. Given logic as the means to decide who is correct, she is objectively wrong in a factual manner.  3. You don't even know my disputes. You're writing me off before you even know why the bible is garbage, this is a logical fallacy on your part.  4. No, by definition ""humans"" are a species. Biology 101. Look it up.  5. How is this contradictory to what I wrote? You're statement was still non-cognitive opinion. Besides, you're ""God"" aborts far more babies than humans do.  6. What colour is the sky in your fantasy world? Just because persons are allowed to get abortions doesn't mean they necessarily will. Lots of mothers place their children up for adoption despite being allowed to abort the fetus, hence the surplus of orphans.  7. No, you've decided it's your business because you're an egotistical hypocrite. You don't automatically have the ""right"" to force others to conform to your personal preferences just because others don't agree with you.  8. Well you were wrong. Don't worry, I'm sure God will forgive you for your prejudice nature. ;)  9. ""XD"" is a laughing emoticon. Welcome to the Internet.   I didn't even use a single negative, so you're comment makes no sense what so ever.   10. A mother who truly loves their child will abort it if she can't support it. There's already enough persons in the world. The only reason why mothers who otherwise would get abortions DON'T is because of the guilt your dogma imposes on them. Therefore they aren't choosing to not abort the fetus out of love, they're doing it out of guilt.

"This is nothing but hacky, sickening propoganda manufactured to instill guilt and fear in anyone considering abortion.  A one, two, three, etc. month old fetus isn't thinking  anything , much less babbling to itself about how much it loves its mommy. The most conservative estimates put fetus's the ability to feel pain at 20 weeks, a date after which abortions are incredibly rare, and likely to be for reasons of an inviable fetus or the mother's health. (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_abortion_by_gestational_age_2004_histogram.svg  )  Even this assertion, notably used in pro-life legislation (  http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18785-briefing-new-law-claims-a-fetus-can-feel-pain.html  ) trying to whittle down the likelihood of a woman getting abortion by any means possible (scrupulous or not) is debated by evidence from various studies that place the ability to feel pain at 24-26 weeks.   http://theweek.com/article/index/204531/                                        can-fetuses-feel-pain    The ability to form any semblance of consciousness probably comes well after pain response, making this piece of chain mail nothing but a slanted fabrication that unrealistically anthropomorphizes the fetus. This particular type of argument abortion is particularly repugnant to me because it relies on lies and misrepresentation to prey on people who are at a vulnerable time in their lives and turn them away from a solution they may otherwise have considered.

"you may not know it but a babies heart starts beatin 18 days after conception and you usually dont know until after then that your pregnant so therefore you are killing a child when you get an abortion unless the outcome is going to be you and the child dying then there is no point whatsoever in killing your child. i think that if you get pregnent and dont want to keep the child the right thing to do would be to give it to a baren couple whom long for children.   It's a blastula, then embryo, then foetus. It is never a child, for child refers to the immature birthed. A baby refers to the recently birthed.  If a mother wants to get pregnant and then abort it is her right to do so. It is none of your business to tell her what she may do with her body, especially when it is such an intimate and emotional decision.
",1
"Some evidence please?  Otherwise LOL   It is an obvious extrapolation from known facts.  Taxis does not require a mind, as observed in simple animals like fruit flies. Brains themselves are complicated entities, which in Humans mature at around 18 to 23 years. Infant brains are still critically forming, hence why they are so dependent upon us and only start learning language after at least the first year and motor function is under critical development.  Why would you assume that an infant has a fully aware mind at birth, much less the weeks before birth all the way down to the first twelve weeks of pregnancy?

"why shouldn't it matter? Doesn't everything deserve a chance? The fetus can't even protect itself or have any say in it. That's not fair to just say ""I'm going to end something/someone's life and there is absolutely nothing nobody can do about it.""   And you still didn't answer the question.
",0
"why shouldn't it matter?   It isn't a life yet. You are a life, I am a life. We have memories, minds, identities. A foetus has none of this, it is alive without being a proper life.  That is why there is no problem with it.   Doesn't everything deserve a chance?   Rationally speaking, no. Life has limited resources, and one of those resources is family. Only so many loving, positive families exist, and abortion prevents a a child from being raised as a burden. Why would you want a child to be raised in a family that was unprepared? Why should a child exist in a loveless or incompetent family? Why should a child become an orphan? Children need deep emotional bonds to become good people. You are supporting a belief that causes inconvenient children to roam the world, growing up into social problems and criminal elements.   The fetus can't even protect itself or have any say in it.    That's because a foetus isn't self-aware. It's a protohuman, it may be alive but it isn't aware of itself.   That's not fair to just say ""I'm going to end something/someone's life and there is absolutely nothing nobody can do about it.""    I believe the abortion issue of today evolved with the far right's displeasure of reduced gender roles brought on by feminism. Abortion is the ultimate sign of a woman's ownership of her body. Something that was traditionally left up to chance is now within her control, and a man can no longer force her to become a mother who stays at home, giving up her dreams. It is her choice now, too. I think that abortion is one of those emotional issues which everyone has a feeling about, but as a matter of private thought, yet politicians capitalised upon it as a means of dividing people and pulling them to support a movement they might otherwise ignore.   In other words, abortion like pregnancy is a private issue that is frankly none of our business when it concerns someone else. The reason we keep it legal is so that a woman may choose to exercise control over her body should the need arise.

"""Please tell me why you are the authority on which 'killings' are okay, and which are not.""  First and foremost, I never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what I deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion. Instead, what I did was set out generic examples on why abortion should be acceptable and unacceptable. If we were to debate about specific cases, there would be no end to possibilities that we could conjure. And secondly, I never wrote that 'killings were okay', I used the word acceptable throughout my point, and that brings a different weightage and seriousness to the issue. Not just one where, it is ""okay"" or ""not okay"" as if we were picking vegetables at a supermarket.  ""Abortion is a consequence.

""  I never implied that abortion is a painless process, it is a very physically and emotionally painful process that may scar one for life. But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'. Instead, they should face up to what they have did and actually consider about raising the life that they created and not kill it simply because they just wanted the pleasure of sex at the point and nothing else. Of course I'm generalizing here by saying that teenagers are irresponsible people, but truth be told, many teenagers choose abortion as the easy way out, when actually they might be able to raise a child with the support of their families. How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned? Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners? If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.   ""It's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother's life.

Stop using 'we' as if a pregnancy between two people who are not you is an event in which your opinion matters.""  I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance. And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place would she? Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.

If you are personally pro-life but politically pro-choice, then I don't really have anything to dispute with you. I would still think your personal opinions were kind of callous and vindictive, but I respect someone with the ability to have an opinion and not try to get it passed into legislature.   But what I'm trying to say here is that, teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement'.    I know exactly what you are trying to say. That teenagers should be punished with pregnancy, childbirth, and according to you, childrearing, if they dare to have sex.   Note: I am not advocating that all teenagers get abortions. I also think that all possibilities should be considered. If they feel like they can raise a child, or bear the pregnancy and give it up for adoption, fine. If they feel like they cannot, also fine.    How then, should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned?   Whenever the pregnant person in question wants one. Unlike you, I realize it is not my place to be to condone or condemn the situations in which some people choose to get an abortion.   Moreover, having curable diseases (I presume you're referring to STDs in this case) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment'. STDs occur, why? Because both parties weren't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners?   That is not how transmission works. Someone who contracts an STD could have been completely honest about their past, and indeed have only had one sexual partner. It takes only one partner being dishonest or just ignorant about their past to spread an STD.   If that was a mistake on their part, then yes, they should face it in the same way we should consider BOTH abortion and having a family. And not just choose abortion as the easy route route. Besides, when you're sick, you get treated am I right? There's only one option. When one is pregnant, she can choose to keep the child or abort it, that's two options. I see no relation between the two issues.    Your first two sentences don't make any sense to me. You will have to rephrase. I will also rephrase this point as it seems you misunderstood me as well.  Pregnancy and STDs are both sometimes consequences of sex. Not necessarily irresponsible or promiscuous sex, just sex. This is especially true for pregnancy.  Abortion is a way of dealing with a pregnancy. Carrying it to term is also a way of dealing with a pregnancy. You advocate the latter option, because apparently the former option is 'the easy way out' and you think people (teenagers specifically?) should have to ride out the course of the consequence.  Treatment is a way of dealing with and STD. So is leaving it untreated. By the same principles on which you find abortion unacceptable (not the human rights issue, which is I am not considering in this comparison, but the argument that the only way to correctly deal with the consequences of sex is to not get an abortion) then you should also advocate that people not seek treatment for STDs. Doing so would be the easy way out, after all.   I do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if I were to have done that, I would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother's health risks during the pregnancy and it's grave importance.   You think abortion is acceptable only some of the time. In cases where the mother is not in danger, but does not want the fetus, do you think she should be made to keep it? If so, this is reducing her to the rank of a subcitizen whose body is mercy to the actions others find acceptable or unacceptable.  As I said before, if you personally think she should keep the baby but do not advocate making abortion illegal in any situation, then I do not actually have anything to dispute.    And secondly, I do not see why you have labelled a mother for ""incubating a fetus she doesn't want"" For if she doesn't want the fetus, she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place have gotten pregnant in the first place would she?   Is this a misstatement or do you actually think that fertilization occurs only with the express permission of the mother?   Lastly, I have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions. I never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state, she should definitely abort the baby. I instead mentioned that the couple's opinions should be duly respected and of course, be of the most importance. I simply brought up the point in which if a mother's health is at risk, abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another.   I don't think any particular pregnancy should be definitely aborted either. That is not the point I am arguing at all.

"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)

"women have a very upsetting time when they have to decided to end a pregnancy, alot of thought goes into it, its not something that is planned over night. its the most heartbreaking decision you may need to ever make for you. for what ever reason this has to be done, the woman knows..she, her body has to deal with and face the painful descision.some may feel a weight has left their burden shoulders when its over, some can still miss what was growing inside them.some feel extreme guilt. but none jump for joy,some wish they didnt have to be in that position. some men are no support, some men may not understand why the women chooses this path..but remember one thing, judge if you must, but its not your body that goes through the changes, it not your body it is taking over. the women stands alone on this one, its her body her property.. alot of women cantcope with going through to birth. from the moment you find out your pregnant you should no wether or not you want it..birth control does not always work. things can happened, out of your control which can lead to pregnancy. either way it was the right descisian for them.. they have to live with their feelings afterwards.. they need to forgive themselfs, and god will do the same....

"The true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion.   You know, this is actually a common thread amongst conservatives, especially the fundamentalists.

They are against contraception because that removes the consequences they believe ought to follow from sex out of wedlock. They are against abortion because an unexpected newborn to them is some form of life lesson for (in their view) immoral behaviour and it is essentially punishment.  For the rest of us, I suppose that holding a person's future in your hands and choosing to ruin their lives as some sort of moral lesson designed to teach that the arbitrary morals held by a particular group are rules of nature, is frankly ghastly.   The second major issue I have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born...that is scientifically speaking utter garbage...revealing a lack of understanding about human biology.   Just to set the record straight, I have no emotional issue with infanticide or homicide if it has a rational basis. Quite frankly, the newborn brain is still simple enough that I see no moral dilemma if the newborn must die for a rational reason. I set the ethical cut-off point at birth for the sake of convenience.   Creating an ultimate test of sentience and consciousness and then applying it to a large sample of foetuses as they mature and are birthed in order to definitively answer when a newborn has a mind capable of thought and awareness that we would call human is a task that is presently beyond us. Further it forgets that abortion is and always was the personal choice of the mother, since it is her body, and rationality dictates that an adult mind ought to have priority when compared to a developing mind.   Abortion is murder.  Pure and simple.  I am no christian incidently...my premise is entirely logical.   Murder is the unauthorised (illegal) killing of an individual.

Taken strictly, this definition excludes many structures that are ""fruits"" in the common sense of the term, such as those produced by non-flowering plants (like juniper berries, which are the seed-containing female cones of conifers[1]), and fleshy fruit-like growths that develop from other plant tissues close to the fruit (accessory fruit, or more rarely false fruit or pseudocarp), such as cashew fruits. Often the botanical fruit is only part of the common fruit, or is merely adjacent to it. On the other hand, the botanical sense includes many structures that are not commonly called ""fruits"", such as bean pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, tomatoes, and many more. However, there are several variants of the biological definition of fruit that emphasize different aspects of the enormous variety that is found among plant fruits.[2]''  Wiki - Fruit  You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.

Fruit cells envelop seeds (usually) and they are alive. The only important difference between them and foetal cells is that foetal cells lack a cell wall. Both a foetus and a fruit if left alone have the potential to grow a new life. In the case of a fruit, the seeds may grow into new trees or shrubs. In the case of a foetus, it may grow into a human. Both have this potential, but they are not presently realised.   This is what you are saying effectively...that my testes are individual animals...   I never said that apples were independent life forms, but when you pick them from the tree they do live on their own apart from it.  Also, if you want to get into the biology of it, the cells which make up your testes are part of an evolved collective of cells, a relationship which evolved over many millions of years. Multicellular life is, in a sense, many cells working together through evolved inter-dependence. So in a historical sense, yes, your testes have cells which are animals (animals need not be multicellular) but which are evolved to be genetically identical and inter-dependent.

How does that prove that a foetus is no more special than a Plum?   Without an identity it is as generic.   A foetus is human...a Plum is not.   So? This isn't a comment of any use. It's accepted that a human is not a plum.

"In order to be sacred you need different DNA? I never understood that argument, quite frankly and I have heard it before... as if having unique DNA gives you consciousness and individuality.   In order to be 'sacred' or human you need to have human DNA.  In order to be a unique organism/lifeform (multicellular or unicellular) you need unique DNA or perhaps even RNA in the case of viruses.  Having a unique genome as does the foetus (and its identical twin(s) possibly) means that the foetus(es) is(are) a seperate biological entity(ies) from it's/their mother.  That is the crux of that argument...hope that clarifies.  Yes plants bacteria and other organisms effectively clone themselves in certain hermaphrodite self fertilizing or mitosis related situations...but even the clone will not have 100% of the parent DNA.  The laws of entropy and biolological mutation demand that...or evolution would never have occurred.  Every organism is unique...if only very slightly.

The sound of your heart beat  is my favorite lullaby.  Month Two  Mommy  today I learned how to suck my thumb.  If you could see me  you could definitely tell that I am a baby.  I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though.  It is so nice and warm in here.  Month Three  You know what Mommy  I'm a boy / girl!  I hope that makes you happy.  I always want you to be happy.  I don't like it when you cry.  You sound so sad.  It makes me sad too  and I cry with you even though  you can't hear me.

I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes  and stretch my arms and legs.  I am becoming quite good at it too.  Month Five  You went to the doctor today.  Mommy, he lied to you.  He said that I'm not a baby.  I am a baby Mommy, your baby.  I think and feel.  Mommy, what's abortion?  Month Six  I can hear that doctor again.  I don't like him.  He seems cold and heartless.

"even if you had an emotional past or some effect that leads to having abortion, honestly the baby did not do anything to you. what happened to you should not have killed the baby. you call yourself human. taking a life is nothing to go on living or smiling about, and then how could you even begin to wake up everyday knowing you took your own baby's life   A couple critical points:  This    http://blog.bioethics.net/baby.jpg   Is not equal to this   http://www.typicallyspanish.com/spain/ uploads/1/foetus.jpg    Or this   http://topnews.net.nz/images/Embryo.gif   A baby is not a foetus or an embryo. The words are not interchangeable. When a woman is pregnant, a baby isn't sitting in her womb for nine months already developed. Calling it a baby is a way to emotionally hijack the topic. It's like calling hamburgers ""puppies"" in order to make us vegetarians.  Second point: A foetus is not a life. It hasn't lived in the outside world yet and formed an identity.

"Having an abortion is just pure selfishness, it is is as simple as that. Women make a choice themselves to have sex, and then play god and decide if the child can live or die, making such invalid comments as ""its my body its my choice"" not realizing that it is not just about them anymore.  You cannot say that a fetus is not human, or not living. Everything about the fetus was made from living organism, and blood and cells ect ect, it took two LIVING breathing humans to make this child. Is a plant not alive simply because it cannot speak? is a microscopic plankton not alive simply because you cannot see it with the naked eye? no. It is as alive as you are.   There is no reason for abortion when there are so many people out there who cannot have children themselves. If a women does not care enough for this child, that she wishes to abort it, then it cannot be hard for her to carry this child and give it to somebody who would love it.  If somebody tried to decide for you, whether you could live or die, you would be angry, that is not a choice they are allowed to make, and it should never be a choice for woman.  Every child deserves a voice, every child deserves to live. Women simply need to wake up and take action for their mistakes. Abortion is murder.

Selfishless is not illegal, nor should it be.  The fetus  is  making its home inside the mother's body, thus the choice of its continued residence there should not fall to anyone else but her. I am sure you enjoy being able to decide what medical procedures are performed or not performed on your body.   Is a plant not alive simply because it cannot speak? is a microscopic plankton not alive simply because you cannot see it with the naked eye? no. It is as alive as you are.    If abortion is immoral because the fetus is alive, and all things are equally alive, then abortion is the same as uprooting a weed.    There is no reason for abortion when there are so many people out there who cannot have children themselves.   Foregoing an abortion does not cure the infertility of strangers.   If a women does not care enough for this child, that she wishes to abort it, then it cannot be hard for her to carry this child and give it to somebody who would love it.   There is no shortage of existing children who do not have homes. There is no reason to add to the number.  I am going to guess you have never seriously considered what it might be like to be  forced  to be pregnant based on what someone else thinks you are allowed to do with your body.   If somebody tried to decide for you, whether you could live or die, you would be angry, that is not a choice they are allowed to make, and it should never be a choice for woman.   No, I wouldn't. If I was a fetus, I would be incapable of anger. If I was conscious, as I am now, I certainly wouldn't be happy, but I would never make another human function as a life support system for me.

"Abortion is not okay. It is the destruction of a defenceless and innocent human life. Despite the occasional case of a woman's life being at risk, the overwhelming majority of abortions are not in such cases.  We would not allow the killing of a two-year-old, a two-month-old, even a two-hour-old in any comparable situation. The fact that the child is unborn makes no difference to the morality of the action.

"Am I to gain from this the understanding that you believe abortions are acceptable in the occasional case that the pregnancy is harmful?  If so, if the fact that the fetus is not a child 'makes no difference to the morality of the action', then why allow would you allow abortion in any case, ever? There are no cases in which the murder of a two-year-old is permissible and if a fetus and a two-year-old are interchangeable, what is the difference? If the end result is identical for the fetus, why would motivation make a difference?

"Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. Rescue the weak and needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked (Psalm 82:3-4).  Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. If you say, ""But we knew nothing about this,"" does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? (Proverbs 24:11-12).  Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers? (Job 31:15).  Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast. From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God (Psalm 22:9-10).  For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be (Psalm 139:13-16).  This is what the LORD says—he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you...(Isaiah 44:2).  Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all you who remain of the house of Israel, you whom I have upheld since you were conceived, and have carried since your birth. Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you (Isaiah 46:3-4).  And now the LORD says—he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD and my God has been my strength (Isaiah 49:5).  The word of the LORD came to me, saying, ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations"" (Jeremiah 1:4-5).  When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy"" (Luke 1:41-42, 44).  SO THE BIBLE VERSES HAVE SPOKEN THIS IS WRONG  BUT...

The people of Samaria must bear their guilt,  because they have rebelled against their God.  They will fall by the sword;  their little ones will be dashed to the ground,  their pregnant women ripped open.”   1 Samuel 15:1-3   Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the Lord. This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’”    Deuteronomy 21:18-21   If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.” Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.   In other words, the bible teaches us that god cares nothing for the lives of children.

"Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want.  1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not. But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women; there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.

If we become a race that allows the murder of unborn children simply because the mother is not smart enough not to get pregnant in the first place we become a pretty sorry nation.   They are not children. Words have a distinct meaning. Children are born, and have minds of their own. A foetus has no mind. It is incomplete, unaware. I think that you need to come to terms with your nature, that like all life we are mechanisms which are built in stages. A foetus is a stage of human without a mind, or awareness of itself. Killing it is like killing a doll.   If the baby is the result of rape and is not harmfull to the mother to carry that child, there are plenty of mothers out there waiting for a child that they cannot bring into this world.   That's what orphans are for.   When a murder is commited, it becomes everybody's business. I'm sorry if she stepped on your toes as one who possibly had an abortion but she wasn't pointing a finger, just stating a fact.   A foetus isn't a child. A foetus cannot be murdered. You need to learn your place, let women make their own decisions without sticking your nose into it.

"Abortion is murder no matter when a person believes life becomes official. This controversy will remain for centuries, however the fact that a potential life has ended before given a chance remains evidence enough for most people to understand why a person should never have a choice of whether a baby lives or dies. There are many reasons abortion should be illegal including the descriptive and disturbing stories about how aborted babies sometime scream as they come out and the looks of pain on their faces. These facts alone should convince anyone to eliminate the idea of pregnancy termination out of their mind.   The health threat to the mother after going through with the procedure as well as the lifelong health risks that remain should be good enough reasons abortion should be illegal. With the rising healthcare costs and instance of disease greater than the medical ability to solve the problems, continued health remains important to all people. Self induced problems such as voluntary termination of pregnancy leads to complications for future pregnancies, reproductive disease, and depression. Understanding that abortion is murder aids a woman in making healthy decisions for baby and mother. Though a mother may not want her baby, health for both remains and adoption remains a viable option. God chooses many couples to be available for adopting these children by way of impotence by one or both people. Bottom line, was sex made for reproduction? Yes. Can you say abortion is natural? No

So why would you ever kill an innocent, unborn human? Especially one that is half of you? Even if rape is involved, would you murder an innocent neighbor child because you were raped? Think of how your life would be different if even one person you know had never existed: multiply that by hundreds of thousands. More people have been killed by abortions (in the US only) in the past six years than Jews died in the Holocaust (there are app. 1.37 mil each year). By this time tomorrow, app. 3,700 more babies will be dead. I truly am sorry if it was a mistake, if the mother's not ready, even if there was rape involved. But that is still no reason to take a human life! I am fourteen (yes, fourteen), and I would not do it! Never would it even cross my mind! Only God can create life; only He should take it away.

"Unborn babies are living things and when you kill them, it is the same thing as killing an adult or a child. God is the creator of life and when you kill unborn babies you are destroying his creations. In the beginning God created Adam by breathing the breath of life into his nostrils. “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” Psalm 139:13.   Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides. If somebody did this they would be breaking the fifth commandment: You shall not murder. He or she is also breaking the first commandment : You shall have no other gods. You should help everyone stay healthy and alive.   I have four sisters and I am glad none of us have been aborted.   Abortion could distroy everything including mankind!!! Than we would all be dead!! DEAD!!! DEAD!! DEAD!!! DEAD!!!  AAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

"Contrary to popular belief Roe v. Wade never legalized abortion. It stated that until the fetus became viable to live on it's own if it was taken out of the woman that her right to privacy outweighed the state's interest in the protection of life. It also stated that until the child is born it is in effect outside the jurisdiction of the United States and therefore NOT entitled to protections offered to citizens of the United States. The only protection that could be offered to the fetus was in a manner that servered the state's intrest while protection the privacy of the woman. (in other words the fetus had no rights and the ablity of the state to interfer with pregenacy was limited in the absolute extreme)  By legalizing abortion you are, in effect, giving the government jurisdiction inside your body. I for one think that government has no right inside a person's body.  Keep the current rule that abortion is neither legal nor illegal becuase it's outside the juristiction of the goverment. Keep a person's body soverign to themselfs only.

"It is a known FACT that human life begins at fertilization.   Life. Not consciousness. Taking life painlessly is justified in some situations.   Just because you may be adopted does not mean you’ll have a miserable unsuccessful life.   No one said this.   Did you know that Faith Hill, Jamie Foxx, and Babe Ruth were adopted?   Did you know one of the aborted children was going to be a mass murderer? Did you know one of them was a better baseball player than Babe Ruth? This is why your argument is nonsense. If all three of your examples were aborted, no one would feel their absence. Even the fetuses wouldn't.   Abortion is done for mere convenience. Many women don’t know the true facts of abortion until it is to late and often feel depression, guilt, isolation, insomnia or nightmares, and much more after it is done. Even Jane Roe (Norma McCorvey) is pro-life now.    Just as a side note, a lot of this could be said about giving birth. But it's right. This information should be publicized more, and made mandatory before going through with the procedure.

"Lack of intention doesn't imply it was against their will. It just means they aren't the brightest fish in the tank.

"Intelligence and desire to have sex are two entirely different parts of the brain. One can be very stupid and have no sex drive. As can one be very smart, very horny and take all reasonable precautions (pill, condom, etc) and STILL end up pregnant. Sex is more than procreation. Other primates (and many other species) have sex for the pleasure alone. Humans have those same desires--smart or not.

"I agree that intelligence and desire are two different things but...  Sex is pleasurable, but it is still procreation.  If you are smart, you will know that birth control fails. If you are intelligent and want to have sex, but don't want a child, you will re-think the sex.   What child deserves to die simply because his 'genius' mom doesn't think he should inconvenience her?

Yes, it is possible that a blackmarket clinic may be actually safer than some legal clinics, but because of the very nature of the black market, in being deregualted, there is no guarantee. Comparitively, because legal practioners would be regulated, there is an expected minimum, a guarantee of sorts, at least, if you will.

"//Sex is pleasurable, but it is still procreation.//  Yes, sex is a form of procreation; however, there are points that suggest that sex in humans are not just for procreation. If sex was entirely for procreation, 1) pregnancy would be a direct result every time; 2) we would ""know"" when a woman is in estrus and engage in sexual activity during this time only; and 3) fertilisation of a human egg is possible without sexual activity due to the invention of IVF.  //If you are smart, you will know that birth control fails. If you are intelligent and want to have sex, but don't want a child, you will re-think the sex.//  Intelligence has nothing to do with having sex or not. It is natural to have sexual desire and in my opinion, it is stupid to avoid sex when it has many other factors than for ""making babies"". Women are not broodmares.  //What child deserves to die simply because his 'genius' mom doesn't think he should inconvenience her?//  Firstly, what child is involved when a woman is considering abortion during her pregnancy? If you are the ""genius"" why do you fail to grasp that ""child"" is the developmental stage from birth to adult?   //Why should he lose his life, which is his own, because he depends on her for survival but she doesn't feel like taking care of him?//  If you want to take this stance then it begs the question: How do you know it has it's own ""life"" when biologically, it is not viable?  A fetus depends upon the host for development since it cannot function at these life functions without being signalled maternally:  -homeostasis, metabolism, adaptation, organisation, growth, reproduction and respond to external stimuli.

"firstly Is it not legal in the US ??   in Britain it has been legal for along time. and i know i sided with the YES however most valid points have been made and i would just like to say i believe that the time period needs to be properly looked at. 24 weeks and a baby is well a baby... not a feetus. and the abortion process at that stage is horrific. chopping up the baby to get it to fit our of the whom.... i do not want to go on.  but i think there should be a shorter limit on it. also if someone take so long to decide then they may be unsure or be being forced into it (may have been hiding it)..... should defiantly be more regulations. ect to ensure a safer system

"I continually go back and forth on this issue weighing the pros and cons. Sometimes I feel as though it should be illegal because if you are responsible enough to be having sexual intercourse you should assume responsibility for a child. However, I agree with the above poster on unsafe conditions for those that will ultimately seek out an abortion whether it is legal or not. There are plenty of irresponsible people having sex and having children. I think abortion should be legal and safe sex practices should be enhanced in schools. Abortion should be the last resort.
",1
"""if you are responsible enough to be having sexual intercourse you should assume responsibility for a child."" First off, I don't think anyone ever thought that because you had sex, you were also responsible. But, either way, the option for abortion should be legal, I think that making abortion 100% illegal would be a terrible decision. There will always be fringe cases in which abortion makes more sense than having a child, and to strike that option off the list forever would just create unsafe, unmanaged, abortion clinics because they would have to go underground and operate in secrecy without proper health standards. All in all, this country would be much worse off without it.
",0
"It should be legal because it is an action on someone's body and that person has a right to do what they want with their body. Obviously the person should make an educated decision if to get an abortion or not(adoption is a viable option)but in the end it is their choice.  If the person considering abortion lives in poverty(or other adverse conditions) and does not feel or know that she can properly care for the baby once it is born and give it the foundation of a good and healthy life then an abortion should be legal so as that the suffering that the child would endure could be prevented.   Making abortion illegal denies one's freedom over one's body and no institution should be able to make such a claim or action.

One takes nine mos. and many hours of labor... the other takes only a few minutes. Which do you think might attract the more talented , dedicated and professional Drs ? Can you even call them that when their purpose is to kill very little humans for big money, so people will not be inconvenienced ? ""Hit"" men might be a better name, based on what they truly do ""legally"".

If you think it is ""human"" from the moment of conception then I must assume that you are at least misinformed. A fly is a more complex living thing than a blastocyst (day 3 of pregnancy).

"A fetus is not yet a child. It is the product of the woman's body despite it  being viable future offspring. And although males have a stake in this  creation of life they are not the ones who have to take the risks of bearing  children. Pregnancy is a very risky situation for women and I think the  pro-life camp takes this very lightly. Women are responsible for bringing  life into this world, however that responsibility falls into each and everyone  of their hands. Every woman should have the right to decide what's best  for her health. After all it's her body and not yours.

"The only real advocacy for pro-life is the thought of killing a child. It's living tissue I'll give you that, but would you have a C-section at 2 months and call it a birth?

And if you're going to make the argument that stopping a child from existing is murder, in that case, sex without procreation is murder, or for that matter, not deciding to have a child at any point is murder.  The only event horizon would be life at conception. That's purely a religious claim. A conscious human being cannot be contained within 2 cells.

"Early-term abortions should undoubtedly be legal.  I have one question for all of those who claim that abortion should be illegal because it is taking a life: If abortion becomes illegal, and a woman has an illegal abortion, what should her punishment be? Technically what she has done is murder; thus, under current laws, capital punishment would be a common solution. So, does a woman who has an abortion deserve the death penalty?

"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)
",1
"Safe, legal, and rare. Prevent rape by sex-ed, use only highly-trained doctors, and include it in insurance. If an abortion is necessary (mental, physical, or deciding not to have a kid), then do it. Abortion pretty much only works after 3 weeks, and before that, contraception.

"Yes, of course. It's ridiculous to tell a woman that it is not her choice to keep or get rid of her unborn child. She will be the one to carry it and ultimately decide to keep it or not. And, to arguments that say the child could, 'grow up to be someone special', yes, and he/she could grow up to be someone who contributes nothing to society at all.

"Making abortion illegal does not prevent abortions. Those who can afford to circumvent the system will (by going to another state/country/bribing a doctor/etc)--in reality, outlawing abortion hurts poor women more than any other demographic because they are the ones that will turn to back-alley abortions and suffer infection/complications/death because of it.  Also, the government has a greater obligation to the health of the mother than the fetus. We can argue all we want about when life begins, but I'm pretty sure you're not a citizen until after you're born. At least, until they start issuing conception certificates instead of birth certificates.

"i believe that it is wrong but that i also think that it should be legal because some people don't have any control over getting pregnant because of rape. and they just are not ready to have a child because or age, finances or both. it also needs to be legal because women and or men will take it into their own hands and do it themselves therefore inflicting damage upon themselves as well possibly permanent damage. and maybe even death to the mother. abortions have to be legal or all hell will break loose and the death rate will increase substantially

Don't criticize just because you're not going to be that poor unfortunate 16 year old girl who can't go to college and pursue her dreams because of a mistake.

"Well, the 16 yr old girl and 18 yr old boy should have thought about that BEFORE they decided to shack it up. Actions have consequences. And if these kids themselves decide that it is such a 'mistake' then put the baby up for adoption.

"I don't think that is an age where you necessarily fully understand consequences, vies change when people get older. It's that time when everyone wants to have fun.  As for adoption, the baby is going to have to be born but it's even more painful never knowing who their true parents are and always questioning it.   Abortion seems a way to fully erase one's mind of the error they had made.

"I disagree with you at the age of 16 and 18 they do fully understand consequences. Parents and teachers and life teach them that every action has consequences and by that age there have been enough lessons of actions and consequences.   If you think having an abortion fully erases the mind of ""error"" as you call it then well then you never had one. It sure does not erase your mind.

"Abortion should not be legal. It is the taking of a human life however you try to spin it. Everything happens for a reason; the baby should not suffer because of the mistakes of the parents. Most abortions that take place in America are cases of convenience, which is clearly wrong! I do understand that cases of rape or medical necessity are more difficult and cannot be black and white. I have compassion for these mothers and feel for their situations. Adoption is a great alternative!

"In Susan Wicklund's book ""this common secret"" about her struggles as an abortion provider, she tells a story of a woman who goes in for an abortion because she believes her abusive husband will kill the baby if she has it. She is turned down, and shortly after the baby is born, she appears at the E.R. with the dead baby. Which is better, Renee, the chance of a baby ACTUALLY being killed, or never being born?  Abortion is NOT child abuse. murder and real abuse is.  people are more likely to abuse a child they don't want right?  Why not give them the chance to not abuse a child at all?

"Abortion should not be legal. It causes massive deaths, and every human life has unailinable rights endowed by their CREATOR among these are LIFE, (FIRST) and liberty (SECOND) ... Abortion is always a sad and bad choice. I recently got off a flight from Beiging, China, where I met a VERY happy couple who waited 3 years to adopt the 8mos. old beautiful baby girl that they were finally bringing home with them. What a special occasion! Too bad it is so difficult to adopt here, because there are so few babies available, or they would have. The point is; life matters, and adoption is a positive, and very possible answer where BOTH the mother and baby can have bright futures. There are crisis pregnency centers in most towns with helpful people who care deeply about the mother, and baby. Wouldn't YOU prefer adoption over death for YOURSELF ? What CHOICE do you think the unbornbabies would make?? Who will give the baby, it's choice and chance ?.......Can we unite now? What kind of a society sentences these innocent unborn babies to DEATH, ...and gives LIFE sentences to guilty massmurderers ??? Thankfully, Virginia just voted to stop funding abortions with your taxes through Planned Parenthood ( see Wash. Post 2/28/08). Did you know that Planned Parenthood which sounds so good, is the number one provider of death by abortions ? It is also in approx. 180 other countries offering abortions with America's ( your tax ) money. Imagine forcing people with religious and other beliefs against abortion to pay for them through their taxes. That is what the government now does if not stopped. Lets not support Planned Parenthood, who is pro-abortion/death. Let's support the heroes at crisis pregnancy centers who can then better assist mothers in crisis before and after the babies birth...and lets vote pro-LIFE together from now on...

"An example of a post by someone who does not understand science.  THE FOETUS (UK SPELLING) IS NOT ALIVE, it cannot be asked on its rights and has no nervous system, there is a greater need in the social aspects and it is inane to suggest that there is murder in something which saves the money, time, and essentially life of the mother.  The mother keeps the rights, not the child.
",1
"A fetus does not have an informed conscious(at least there is no scientific proof) and thus it could not make a choice of death over adoption or life and thus it means nothing to ask ""What choice do you think the unborn babies would make"" as this is an appeal to emotion.  Also to complain that governments force people against their religion to pay with their taxes for abortion seems hypocritical and naive. If you don't want government to use your tax dollars for abortions because it is against your religion why should the government support tax breaks for religion and your church? because not everyone follows a particular religion yet they end up paying for it. Also don't forget that some churches of various religions work very hard to impose their doctrine/beliefs on to others of which they have no right.   Also all of your sources are biased towards pro-life where their mission is only to support pro-life so how credible is it?
",1
"Do you have a informed conscious mind? Where you once a fetus? I am going to assume that both of those answers is yes, thus it matters little whether a fetus is conscious, merely that if allowed to grow and develop it will have a conscious mind, but if an abortion is carried out that life will never be given a chance to develop. Just imagine what this world would be like if Jonas Salk, or Sir Isaac Newton, or Albert Einstein, or Abraham Lincoln, or George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson had been aborted as children. It's hard to imagine what the world would be like.

"Yes but we don't know if that unborn life could become somebody like Albert Einstein etc but it also could become a Hitler, osama bin laden and countless others. It's chance, we don't know who the unborn will become.   Government should not place restrictions on what a female can do with to her body, because of a chance. Many people die before they have a chance to become somebody like Albert Einstein yet the evidence of their path is there to see, but the government and others don't worry about trying to preserve their life, just the life of a chance which could go any number of ways.

"If you take that view, then we should abort every baby because one in a billion might have the charisma, insanity and happen to be in a desperate country whose economic power has been crippled through exploitation by the ""free world."" By your reasoning none of us should have been born because of the ""chance"" we might turn out bad.

"I'm not saying that we should abort babies because one of them might become like Hitler or Stalin or someone else bad, i'm just saying that if you are gonna use the argument that not aborting a baby might produce a genius then you have to take into account that not aborting that baby could also produce a very evil person. It goes both ways. of course i'm not saying my reasoning would require that every baby be killed, i believe the woman has the final choice so i couldn't decide if the baby is aborted or not i could just suggest.

"If a lack of an informed conscious means you can't make decisions for yourself, then Terry Schiavo's husband was right in starving her to death.

Do not bring religion into a political, and perhaps even scientific debate.  Also, ""Imagine forcing people with religious and other beliefs against abortion to pay for them through their taxes.

"1.""Back alley"" abortions would increase if it were made illegal, leading to increased risk of young women dying or becoming sterile.     2.It's better for society to have babies aborted than have them be brought up poor and neglected, where not only will the child suffer but society when that child develops a higher attraction to crime, welfare, etc.   3.It is a more viable option for those who are unable to shoulder the financial burden and responsibility of raising a child on their own.  4.Giving up a child for adoption can be just as emotionally damaging as having an abortion.   5.Abortion is not murder because it is performed before a fetus has developed into a human person.
",1
"i believe so. the very fact that abortion has been put it shows that there is a need for it. the various circumstances of the individuals requiring abortion differs greatly; a young couple having made a mistake, a couple with financial problems and cannot cope with another child, rape victims, the list goes on. while there are circumstances when one does not deserve to have an abortion, but the child that is born will suffer the consequences of its parents mistakes. Banning abortion is like imposing the death sentence on youths using drugs.
",1
"Personally, I feel that abortion should remain legal, or rather, parents should have the power to make the decision themselves and not face any legal hindrance of any form.  Let us take a look from the social perspective. If parents cannot afford to provide for the child, or if the family is facing financial constraints, it is thus understandable that abortion can remain as one of the options. The unborn child's suffering can be prevented; the family can have lesser burden. Problem of poverty can be reduced. Look at Africa.... ARGH I shall continue later :P

"I think that morals and ethics are based on what we as a society believe, since we define what is right and wrong. People should be given the choice to abort their babies, and whether that is morally right or wrong is then their choice, which it should be; we determine what right and wrong is anyway so everyone should be able to make their own choice.
",1
"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)

"All arguments against abortion are based on religious views. Quit trying to push your beliefs onto others.

"If you do not wish to bear a child for 9 months and give birth to it and be responsible for it, then you should have every right to terminate the pregnancy.  It's a personal, ethical judgement as to whether you believe that what is inside you is a ""human being"" or not, or whether or not you value ""potential"" human beings.  This is a decision that should not be made FOR other people, but one they should get to keep.

"To be honest, abortion is murder, as admitted by many scientists. However, the most common abortion is resulting from people being careless and stupid, not rape. Even in the case of rape, abortion should not be done. Even if the fetus is not alive, why terminate it? Who knows? What if the baby would have been born and developed in to a legendary scientist with an IQ of 200? My friend's mother was advised to abort her unborn child because it was very likely the baby would be born with a defect. She refused, and he was born without any defects and actually is a gifted learner in very advanced classes. So by your logic, if someone runs into your yard and plants an oak tree seed, you should take it out of the ground and dispose of it because it was a mistake? Ridiculous.......

"A better analogy with your seed metaphor would be if someone dug a little hole in the middle of your house and planted a seed for a tree. At first it didn't matter, but then the tree started to grow and take up your whole house. You couldn't get around, there were birds flying around your house that laid nests in the tree, it was awful. So you decided to remove the tree, it is your property after all. But there is a group of people who worship a book that tells them that removing trees from the ground is immoral and should never be done under any circumstances. They are so influential that it is illegal for you to remove the tree. ""What am I supposed to do?"" you say. ""Just wait until the tree is grown after a year, and then you can give it up for someone else to care of"" ""This isn't fair"" you say, ""I shouldn't have to have something growing in my house that I don't want""
",1
"But there is a group of people who worship a book   First of all, Christians don't worship a book. Second, your analogy doesn't make sense, because you are saying that after the tree is born, you want to get rid of it. Abortion does not happen after the baby is born. Not sure what you are trying to say.....

"In my opinion it is wrong, because you kill a baby, even if he was not born. We have to save lives, but not to kill them. Also, it is inmoral according to philosophy. In addition, it harms to the health of woman. Even in future this woman cannot have any babies.

"What is more important is that abortion is the choice of the woman, because she has the child. It is best if at the beginning of pregnancy abortion, because that is the child is not large. Just before the birth abortion, I find it disgusting, because the child has to a large extent to be born perfect. So I think it's good as long as it is the beginning of pregnancy, but just before giving birth.

"These little unborn infants are also living things as we are and when women kill them, it is the almost the same as killing an adult or a child. I can say that God is creator of everything and when we kill unborn babies we destroy his creations.  According to the wordds of Nattyc ""Abortion is when you kill an unborn baby, and the people who do this are selfish because they don't want to spend money on the baby, confused because they don't want to be pregnant, and evil because they kill children, they also don't trust god and what he provides."" abortion is a selfigh decision and I absolutely agree with this statement. We must think about other people, especially about the closet ones. At the time of pregnancy the unborn baby of the wonam is the closest person to her. Women have to appreciaete and save it.

"Abortion isn't killing babies like most people think. A fetus in the early stages of development is really just a soup of cells lumped together in one spot. It doesn't have the ability to think or feel pain as it doesn't have a brain yet.   Sometimes abortion would be the best option for the mother. If a woman had been raped and got pregnant as a result of that, she has all the right to abort if she wants to. If a woman doesn't have the economic resources to support the child, abortion is also an option. Sure, some people say adoption but a lot of kids spend their whole lives in a shelter because nobody adopted them. Can you imagine how much mental pain they go through? How much they've suffered? If this situation is bound to happen, the best option would be to abort the unborn fetus before it has the capability of suffering.

"you may not know it but a babies heart starts beatin 18 days after conception and you usually dont know until after then that your pregnant so therefore you are killing a child when you get an abortion unless the outcome is going to be you and the child dying then there is no point whatsoever in killing your child. i think that if you get pregnent and dont want to keep the child the right thing to do would be to give it to a baren couple whom long for children.  It's a blastula, then embryo, then foetus. It is never a child, for child refers to the immature birthed. A baby refers to the recently birthed.  If a mother wants to get pregnant and then abort it is her right to do so. It is none of your business to tell her what she may do with her body, especially when it is such an intimate and emotional decision.

"Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want.  1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not. But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women; there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.

"A fetus does not have the right to life as long as it is nothing more than a product of its mother and father. When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.  Regardless, abortion is typically always a tough decision for every woman. Many find it to not be the most moral of decisions, but it is usually found to be the right decision.

"I'm a moderate on this issue. I believe abortion is 100% okay up until a certain point in the pregnancy, but during and after that point in the pregnancy, it's 100% wrong.

"It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working?   Mentally retarded people are self aware. Paralysed people are self aware. A person in coma on life support with no change of recovery is not self aware. We should be able to terminate them. They are at this point shells.   If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?   The key note is ""all"" or ""most"" or even ""vital"" cells. We lose cells every day, without suffering harm.   It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.    Abortion != prostitution. If you have an important point to make, then make it.  How many abortions a person obtains is irrelevant to whether it should be legal. It is not pertinent and it is a personal affair.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases.   Not important to the topic. We don't ban vaccinations because of the rare but dangerous side effects. We don't ban surgery despite the very likely possibility of malpractice.  Whatever point you are trying to make is a cover for the fact that late term abortions lead to severe complications when performed by pregnant women at home. An operating room is much safer.   Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion.   I am out-maneuvering you. You only think one step at a time, but I'm several steps ahead of you. Learn to concede when you are off topic and we'll get along fine.   Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us.   How young are you? A teenager? You sure are wide-eyed if you think law and the justice system are about truth.  Juries are made up of peers, average blokes. Many are easily distracted by irrelevancies, just like you were when you brought up prostitution and abortion death rates.   And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.   What makes a strong argument? To most people it is an argument that is easiest to comprehend, and it should appeal to their prejudices.  You want to win points with me? Argue in a way that is clear, has few red herrings, and is rational rather than an appeal to feelings.

"Really? So why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage?  Again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells, tissues, blood cells and or organs, does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them? Does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life? Why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then?  You seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics. Again, abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman's body over which she has total control. So to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body. Why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic. The last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman's right to control her own body.  If the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money? Don't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going? Again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality.  Check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds. So then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion. Read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also don't forget that abortion can cause future infertility.  Why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic? Isn't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not? Last time i asked that question, the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible. Almost half of all abortion cases (48%) according to the Center For Disease Control are repeat abortions.  It does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments. My opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims.  Debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself don't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic?  I might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon, i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the Supervising Police Superintendent of Juvenile Affars, Legal Clerk for The Attorney General in my country and also Assistant Sworn Clerk of The Supreme Court of my country. Now i am pursuing my studies in Criminal Law.  Again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem. Maybe on this website but not in reality. And because i am a teenager does not mean that i don't understand what society is because there are many adults that would never be able to accomplish what i have done.

"Really? So why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage?   A person with Alzheimers has started to lose their awareness, their brain is literally being destroyed. We grant them this exception out of mercy.  However refer to what I said before: laws are not based on reality, but what people feel ought to be. I don't care about what law says.   Again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells, tissues, blood cells and or organs, does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them? Does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life? Why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then?   When you kill cell, you kill life, but not A LIFE. Same with early-stage abortion.   You seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics. Again, abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman's body over which she has total control. So to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body. Why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic. The last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman's right to control her own body.   I answered you before on this topic: laws are not required to be consistent with each other. That one is allowed and the other forbade is not representative of our stance that a woman ought to have control over her body, but is representative of our legal system's inconsistency.   If the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money? Don't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going? Again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality.   I did not say this. I said that how much it is performed has no bearing on whether it should be illegal. This is about granting a woman the ability to terminate her pregnancy, a very personal choice that affects her body. It isn't about punishing women who have abortions commonly.   Check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds. So then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion. Read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also don't forget that abortion can cause future infertility.   Since you're being obtuse, I'll explain this to you explicitly:  Deaths caused by surgical abortion in a hospital (where trained physicians and emergency equipment reside): some number.  Deaths caused by surgical abortion at home (since abortion is illegal and the woman has to operate on herself): higher than the previous number.   Why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic? Isn't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not? Last time i asked that question, the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible. Almost half of all abortion cases (48%) according to the Center For Disease Control are repeat abortions.   Again, explicit language:  Abortion exists to end unwanted pregnancies. Your concern over repeat abortions is based on personal feelings of morality and a desire to punish irresponsible women, it is irrelevant to the aim of abortion: ending unwanted pregnancies.  Should we ban condoms because some people have dozens of partners and are avoiding the consequences of disease? No. Condoms exist to prevent pregnancy.   It does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments. My opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims.   Sorry to disappoint you, but your arguments are all over the place. You have no direction and I have to keep you on topic.  You're free believe that you'll somehow ""beat me,"" but if this is your best caliber of argument style, you'd better just ask me to help you learn how to improve your debate tactics.   Debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself don't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic?   Of course I understand your questions. I can tell you're off topic because whenever you ask a question that appeals to an authority or my emotions rather than the issue at hand, a woman's right to end her pregnancy and the scientific fact that most aborted foetuses cannot be self aware, I know you're obscuring the topic.   I might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon, i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the Supervising Police Superintendent of Juvenile Affars, Legal Clerk for The Attorney General in my country and also Assistant Sworn Clerk of The Supreme Court of my country. Now i am pursuing my studies in Criminal Law.   You're still but a child, and could learn a few things from seasoned adults who know much more about these topics than you.   Again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem. Maybe on this website but not in reality. And because i am a teenager does not mean that i don't understand what society is because there are many adults that would never be able to accomplish what i have done.   And you don't think that critical thinking on my behalf has prevented me from engaging your red herring topics, hmm?  Winning an argument is real life has little to do with the truth. That's why politicians engage in petty topics and the news is full of mud slinging. That's why in the United States, half the population believes the earth is under 10000 years old.  You might have had a busy few years of your life, but don't forget that you're still young and have a lot more to learn. Now please, proceed in the debate but focus of the issue of foetal awareness, and compare it to the woman's level of awareness. Also look into the dangers of illegal abortions, and discuss the societal effects of forced pregnancy on unprepared mothers.

"I am surprised you say that you don't care about what the laws say. Try telling that to a trial judge. Anyway, it is good that you made that point because a fetus is at a point where the brain is now developing making them unaware of the surrounding which is why people refers to them as being in the baby stage. But you are failing to understand that because of the destruction of those cells, the life of the person might be in danger which is why a criminal charge has to be instituted. The type of cells and tissues however that we are referring to is referred to as a developing human being who is growing into complete human form with a complete DNA and blood type. But didn't you say that what a woman does with her body is nobody's business then how come there are laws to prevent her from prostituting her body?  Okay. According to statistics released by the WHO in terms of abortion, the number of abortions that performed for the year 1995- 45.5 million of which 19.9 million were illegal.  According to a report from The Guttmacher Institute, Unsafe abortion causes an estimated 70,000 deaths each year, and an additional five million women are treated annually for complications resulting from unsafe abortion. Approximately three million women who experience serious complications from unsafe procedures go untreated.  The following methods describe the different methods of abortion. Since you are also a person of science read up on horrifying methods of abortion in which we do not even do this with animals;  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068  I agree but the only purpose abortion serves is to kill the fetus, a human life or organism. Condom does something better than what abortion does. Condom prevents the spread of diseases. And i also agree but how can it be explicit language when i have proof to back up my opinion released by the U.S Gov? Are we aborting a fetus because of fear of infection?  That i will agree with you. I am but a teenager not a child. There is a difference between a teenager and a child. A child is an individual who has not meet the stage of puberty. A teenager is an individual who has or is already going through the stage of puberty. And i also agree with you that there many things i can learn from adults, as long as i am learning it from the correct source. Well we are not discussing a debate based on politics; we are discussing abortion and the law. And i also agree with you that i do have a lot to learn. Oh and by the way now you are starting to use your critical thinking skills. I love that. Now i feel tha twe can openly discuss any topic.

"You kept saying that abortion is right?   Sayyad, stop straw-manning me right now. I never once said anything even close to ""abortion is right"". You keep putting words in my mouth. Do you understand how a debate works?   Why don't you answer me if abortion makes people more responsible?   This isn't even something I've said either. I don't care if abortion makes a person more ""responsible"" so I never said anything about it. I, unlike you, do not need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it.      You speak as if i am here throwing out stuff just like that. I am surprised that you even want to discuss abortion but yet you don't care.   Again, nothing you've said thus far has anything to do with anything I've said. When did I say I don't care? I'm here aren't I? I didn't care about you're story, but I do care about the issue and your story is irrelevant to it. When did I say you were ""throwing out stuff just like that""? Wtf does something like that even mean?  Either you have the wrong address, or you're the single worst debater I've spoken to thus far.   How can a person argue about a topic and say they don't want to know about the rest?   How abortion started doesn't matter. Why would it? It has nothing to do with the issue now.    If i am silly about my preferences then how come you don't know anything about abortion?   Does this pass for logic these days???  If I don't know anything about abortion then how come you added the number ""99"" to your user name? =/  (note: I'm saying your question doesn't make sense)   Who looks more silly? Me or you?    You or I&lt;&lt;   You don't tell me my preference is silly when you can't even give a justification for your choice   Do you not even see your own conceitedness?  You're saying ""I've decided abortion is immoral and I've also decided that everyone should conform to my morality because my morality cannot be wrong, I came up with it!""  Well, how great full these women must be to have someone like you do decide that abortion is wrong for them. =/  And you say this is  not  silliness?   Maybe you should come when we are debating and you will have to see how debating goes and why we law students choose our topics.   Oh dear god. YOU got into law school? Hopefully not to be a lawyer, you'd end up sending all your own clients to the chair.  You think I care that you're a law student? Do you think that makes you infallible? You sir, are beyond egotistical.   Your opinions are based on arrogance or ignorance without any proof or evidence.   Now you're just projecting. ;)   Why don't you try becoming a District Attorney and if you can become one then judge them.    You're not even trying to make sense now, are you? Are you a troll? You must be, no one else could string together so many irrelevant ""arguments"" and walk away feeling like they've accomplished something.   i don't have time to waste on any argument filled with arrogance.   Ah, that explains why you didn't bother proof reading your argument. =/   When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.   Alright, so a reference is pointless because where life begins is a philosophical question, it isn't proven based on how many more people agree with you.  Life is a continuum. It doesn't ""stop"" or ""start"", it just changes.   Does prostitution involves a woman's right to control her own body?   jeez, I don't know what I'm more disappointed in; your poor grammar or the fact that I understood that perfectly =/  A person's profession has nothing to do with their ability to control themselves. Unless she's being raped for money, then shes exercising self control by being a prostitute.   What are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions?   I don't care. Women could get abortions as a hobby for all I care, I don't need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it, I'm not as egotistical as you.   How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?   Again, I don't care and it doesn't matter. It's their choice. They're making the risk, not you, not I. It's none of out business.    Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?   When did I say this? I didn't, because it's not my position.   Try again.   If you say you don't care or you avoid these questions then you are clearly showing that your level of knowledge in this area is based on merely your opinions and not facts.   Or it means you're an idiot and you can't tell the difference between relevant facts and appeals to emotion/authority.  Anyone can pull up an infinite amount of facts, it mean nothing if they aren't relevant. Though, it's cute how you thought writing this would somehow convince me to answer all your questions as though they  were  relevant. XD   If we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified.   You keep saying ""law student"" like being a law student matters. it doesn't. And I don't care if someone would ""disqualify"" you for what I've done because  1. It's irrelevant to this debate   and 2. I happen to know for a fact that calling ""non-sequiter"" on an opponent during a debate is not only allowed, but frequently taken advantage of.  So, either you are a liar or your debating league is full of idiots.  Judging by your argument thus far the former seems much more likely.    Last night we concluded as debate on Hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end.   Why did you write this? It has nothing to do with anything EITHER of us has written.   ""Well, we decided that Hitler was innocent last night, therefore abortion is WRONG!"" &lt;&lt; does this make sense to you??? Or are you purposefully using non-sequiters in an attempt to distract me from your paper-thin argument? =/

"Well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument? You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right. Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact? The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.  Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone. Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case. And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself. Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you? Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.  If you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name?  Is that all you can say ""you came up with it?"" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion. Really? But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them? I don't want them to be grateful to me, i want that child to be grateful to me. A life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society.  Well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think. If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?  Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.  You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.  Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.  Well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from.  And lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning. Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do i have to explain everything to you?

"Well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument?   You're so wrapped up in this duality you've created you haven't even considered that my position is not one of morality. I'm not ""for"" or ""against"" abortion.   It's called ""pro CHOICE"" not ""pro abortion"". =/   You never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right.   No, you've IMPOSED this position on me. This is a matter of your prejudice, not my implication.   Why don't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not? Is it because you are denying the fact?   I don't care because it doesn't matter. I have no right to decide what is good and what is not for other people. Perhaps some people end up more responsible, perhaps some don't.   The whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince.   To justify and prove, eh? A debate is a means, the purpose is invented by the individual. This is still a debate whether my method is through debunking your conclusion or putting forth my own.   Well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences. If you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone.   You seem to be under the delusion that one can derive a position from facts without forming an opinion. A position without opinion is just facts, a position without facts is just opinion. You need both.  I'm not arguing against the facts, I'm arguing against your stupidity. Don't try to shift the blame onto the facts, they can't help what they are.   Why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case.   Because your argument is rooting in morality, mine is rooting in questioning your morality. If you disagree with the origins of abortion for the same reason then it makes no difference, you're still arguing from your personal preferences.   And the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself.   Then start a debate ""How did Abortion Originate?"". It's another topic and doesn't bare any relevance to this one.    Look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you?   You wouldn't like my answer =p   Who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter? Me or you? You are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth.   Can you please get through just one sentence with proper grammar? You can pull up ""facts"" until your fingers are worn to stubs. It means nothing if they aren't relevant.    If you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name?   You... totally missed the point -_-   Is that all you can say ""you came up with it?"" because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion.   Are you dyslexic? That made almost no sense. =/  Again, look up the term ""debunking"".   But i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them?   Again, I've said no such thing. At least  try  to make relevant arguments. =/   I don't want them to be grateful to me, i want that child to be grateful to me. A life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society.   Well well, what a noble man you are; placing the value of life above the value of a good life...  Did I say noble? I meant retarded.   Well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think. If i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams? Would i and end up coming out on the winning end?   Again, either you are a liar or your league is full of idiots. ;)   Because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument. You think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating.   Debating 101: debunking and calling out opponents on non-sequiters IS how a debate works.   There's no need to ""prove"" someone else's abortion is none of my (or your) business. Debunking your reasons for being ""pro-life"" does that by itself. Do you understand?   You said a District Attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why don't you try becoming one first and them judge them, and that is if you can ever become one.   1+2=3 &lt;&lt; you understand this, right? Well, here's a line of reasoning almost as simple and easy to comprehend.   District attorneys are people. People can be stupid and childish; therefore, district attorneys can be stupid and childish.  There's no need to become a district attorney to understand that they aren't infallible.    Really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change? If that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms.   Everything is constantly changing. You're heart pumps fresh blood, your skin falls off and is replaced, sperms turn into zygotes etc. etc. etc.  Life and death aren't opposites, they're complementariness.   Well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from.   Wrong again. I'm not building an argument, I'm debunking yours. There's no ""running"" here, simply wading through the things you've said.   And lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning. Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do i have to explain everything to you?   Nothing you just wrote changes that your Hitler debate has nothing to do with this debate. you could be lying about the whole thing for all I know.  Come on use your head and not only your eyes. Do I have to explain everything to you? ;)

"In a debate either you are for or against. Ask anyone that and they will tell you. Are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion. If i recalled my opposing team was pro choice. Why? Because they are against abortion. You seem to be lacking common sense. Really? As far as i am concerned whatever a person say portrays the idea of that person as in reading a book and trying to figure out the idea or goal of the writer. Again you don't care. That to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge. Your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence. Please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you, you are a person of science. You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts. Please, you are a person of science one day you will stand against an opposing team face to face and then you will understand what i am talking about. When you say that i am retarded lets say that a woman who intentionally has unprotected sex aware of the consequences but now goes to the extent of killing the fetus, are you implying that there is no innocence or good in that fetus? Are you saying that there is nothing wrong with that? To me that is just selfishness. Well in order to debate a topic you need to know the origin of that case and then identify the weakness in that origin. If it was a speech called informative speech and lets say you were referring to reasons why abortion should be made illegal then the origin would have been completely different as my professor advised me last week. Well Actually you do not need to say who is worst or not because i have friends in pre law on here and have already taken a look at this debates and has already given me a response.  Why are you running from the truth? Point out to one statement which you made that had an authoritative reference? Exactly. When you think you know everything or do not want to know then your perception might be wrong. Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy. Believe me and my team comprises of at least 25 members who are excellent at debating. I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.  You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance. You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey. Maybe you are better off in science. When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.  And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.  There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute. Check up on your book again my friend. And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense. You need people to explain everything to you. And furthermore, this is not a debate this is selfishness.

"In a debate either you are for or against. Ask anyone that and they will tell you.   Just asked my brother. Nope, one can be neither for nor against abortion. It's called CHOICE. It's not a matter of ""abortion is good/bad!"" abortion is just an act. ""Good"" and ""bad"" are labels imposed by you.   Are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion.   I'm 90% sure you're a troll now. Pro choice =/= pro abortion. Say it with my now; Pro choice =/= pro abortion. Pro choice is about individuals choosing to either get an abortion or not based on their own unique situation.    Again you don't care. That to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge.   Man, you're really judgmental, aren't you. ;)  I don't particularly care if you find me selfish and ignorant, you have yet to give a relevant reason as to why abortion should be illegal. Not once in all your barely comprehend able posts have you done this.   Your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence.   Actually, this is YOUR debate, or did you mean argument? ;)  There is no inconsistent information in my argument because I haven't posted any ""information"", I've only been debunking you, so now you're a liar. And a bad one at that, do you think I don't comprehend my own posts or something? XD   Please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you, you are a person of science.   I never even said anything remotely like that... -_-    You seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts.   No, opinions should be built on RELEVANT facts. For example; I say you have made the logical fallacy known as ""appeal to emotion"" this is a fact. You say ""Woma have died from abortions, therefore abortion should be wrong"" This is also a fact, it just isn't a relevant one. And if your argument is based on fallacies and irrelevant facts &gt;&gt;YOU ARE WRONG&lt;&lt;   Believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy.   ... Do you think I care? Really? Let them read it. I'll debate them too if they carry your idiocy with them.   I would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here.   And are they all ""pro-life"" too? If so, I've nothing to worry about. ;)   You are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance.    You're projecting again ;)   You think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey.   Oh, I've thought about what you're trying to convey; I've just decided it's wrong relative to the topic is all, ;)   When you debunk don't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that. Debunk with facts.   Again, I'm not against facts. I'm against your stupidity. I'm against the conclusions you've derived from these facts. Stop trying to pass the blame onto the facts, they can't change, but you sure as hell can.   And one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are. Because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement.   ... And yet you have. Is your dunce cap on too tight or something?   There is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute.   Man, it takes a lot of repetition for you to learn, doesn't it? I never said you can't use these things, hell you may even win a debate with them if you're talking to someone even dumber than you (insert your own ""country full of idiots for you to talk to"" joke)... but when you're talking to someone intelligent enough to recognize a logical fallacy (e.g. Myself... and everyone else on this site) you're bound to get called out on it.  And, if you're entire argument is based on a fallacy, then you're wrong. Thus, you lose.   And i do not lie? Maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense. You need people to explain everything to you. And furthermore, this is not a debate this is selfishness.   Selfishness? THIS IS SSSSSSSSSayyad99's attempt at hurting my feelings?

If you keep out of that then perhaps our debate will be good. I create the rules when i create my debates and if you question whether it is my debate or not then you are pushing me to show you whose court the ball is in.  In an argument the term pro choice refers to the killing of the fetus. Change it all you want but you will never be able to change the true meaning of the word. Pro Choice is another way of saying pro abortion. The question here is to kill or not to kill the fetus so i do not know what is the goal of your question? I want an answer not a meaningless question. Rape and Arson is in no way to compare to this topic because they do not even involve the taking of a human life and also both are morally wrong as in abortion where one side is considered morally wrong.  Are you in your right state of mind, then do me a favor and stop debating about abortion if you are not referring to it. Pro choice refers to the term supporting abortion.

"Abortion is going to happen. Its been going on forever. People that are against it do so for moral reasons. I completely understand, but you are failing to realize that it will happen regardless of the legality of the procedure and in some cases is completely warranted. For example, what if your 14 year old daughter is raped and becomes pregnant. Does that not constitute a valid reason for the termination of a pregnancy. What if you are going to give birth to a child with a severe birth defect or extreme retardation. If it wasn't for new advances in medicine these people would never survive anyway, so how is it any different? It sounds harsh and heartless but it is reality none the less. Its like people that are against stem cell research because some of the stem cells come from aborted fetuses. Ok, you object on moral grounds, I get it but what if you're paralyzed and the researchers say a dead baby will help you walk again are you really going to tell me that you're not going to give the green light. The child was aborted regardless of what decision you made, at least let the horrible process have some good that comes out of it.

"I was waiting for someone to bring up this point.  While some women may still have abortions, the abortion rate will definitely decrease by; it is my guess about 90% or even more. How many people would commit murder if it was legal, do you think? Obviously making something illegal is always a deterrent for a large amount of people.  That people will do it anyway is no argument to legalize something heinous. By the same token, should we legalize rape now so that no rapist will have to do it in secret, or because he would do it otherwise anyway?  Why should we abort a child because of mental retardation etc? In the same way should we kill a person because they are mentally ill?  When you talk about horrible process; what is more horrible being half awake whilst doctors are ripping your fetus out of you are giving birth to a life? What if a woman dies from abortion? You are talking as if carrying a pregnancy is more traumatic than doing an abortion. We are against abortion because we are talking about a life and as one professional once said it seems that those who supports abortion are the ones that are already born.  If a person is raped then give the baby up for adoption. There are other choices available. Don't make it seem as if abortion is the only way out.

"""Extra Bunch of Cells?""  Maybe not to the same extent as, say, scraping the inside of your cheek or scratching a layer of epidermis with your fingernails, but they lack any human fetus or vertebrae features until well into 3 months of development. Otherwise, what you'd see under a microscope really would just be unremarkable ""cell"" reproduction.     I'm sure what Hollow more accurately meant to say was ""blastocyst,"" which is really just a scientific term for the pre-fetus stage of conception in which the developing embryo really IS just a clump of cells that begin reproducing after the fertilized ovum has attached itself to the uteran wall. For the technical definition, see:  Blastocyst: A thin-walled hollow structure in early embryonic development that contains a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass from which the embryo arises. The outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta and other supporting tissues needed for fetal development within the uterus while the inner cell mass cells gives rise to the tissues of the body.  (http://www.medterms.com/script/main/ art.asp?articlekey=18258)   And if you're confused by what an ""embryo"" is:  A human embryo is a discrete entity that has arisen from either: the first mitotic division when fertilization of a human oocyte by a human sperm is complete or any other process that initiates organized development of a biological entity with a human nuclear genome or altered human nuclear genome that has the potential to develop up to, or beyond, the stage at which the primitive streak appears, and has not yet reached 8 weeks of development since the first mitotic division.

"I know the way I would state my opinions would not prove helpful towards this discussion, so here is a quote, in place, by respected novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand.

A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living take precedence over the not-yet-living (or the unborn). Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered.

This way, all pro-life supporters who really really really wanted to take away the rights of Americans should have to pay 118,590 dollars over 18 years (average expenditures for a child in a low-income single-parent home). I'm sure when they are finally frustrated with paying for that child  unnecessarily  (like a mother who could have had an abortion), the pro-life supporters will stop denying the rights of others.  Because, you see, not all Americans are as rich as you are and many can't afford one or more child to take care of, especially teenage mothers.

But if it's just some teen who got screwed over (No pun intended (Just kidding. Pun totally intended)) and she isn't ready to take on a child, especially since her boyfriend is likely to desert her after finding out she's pregnant or if it was just a one night thing between two strangers, she should be aloud to get rid of that extra conglomeration of cells (since that's all it is) and go on with her life.

But in the instance that the unborn child is harming the life of the mother, the pregnancy is terminated. So in this case, the unborn child is then stripped of its human rights, and the mothers rights trump the unborn child's.   So which is it, pro-lifers? Does an unborn child have human rights or doesn't it?

"If someone is irresponsible enough to avoid having the baby, they are not responsible enough to have the baby. If there is choice, then there is chance to ruin only one life. But if a baby is raised by people not ready, or incapable of raising a baby, then that would ruin two lives. The babies and the mothers at least. Maybe three, including the father.

"What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications—surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068

"[What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts]  I believe Avasked said mistreatment counted as cruelty. Last I checked, mistreating someone includes murder and rape. Cruelty must involving hurting someone, physically or mentally. The fetus cannot think nor can feel.

"So are you saying that murder is not cruelty? According to the laws it is and also a person can commit rape in a cruel manner by hurting the victim mentally and physically through the ordeal.  Like i asked aveske, a person who is paralyzed has lost their consciousness, so should we kill them because they cannot think or feel too?

"I agree with you. We should not abort a fetus simply for the purpose that it will cause or bring convenience to us.

"No one kills a fetus  because  it isn't a conscious being.   A paralyzed person is not in a literal parasitic relationship with another human being. If they are on life support, they are being kept alive by machines. They are not infringing on anyone's rights to bodily autonomy.

"Do you have any evidence to suggest that the fetus is more of a parasitic entity? It is not a conscious being but so are the people who are paralyzed who depend on other people to take care of them even though they are on life support machines. According to you a fetus is not a conscious being so how can it infringe on a person's right to her own body?
",0
"In the case of paralyzed or comatose patients, if a caretaker becomes unhappy with the situation, they are legally allowed to quit or otherwise cease their involvement. This is also not an issue of bodily autonomy.  The only evidence I need for the parasitism of the fetus is the definition of the word parasite: an organism that lives inside another organism (its host) and siphons resources without reciprocation. The fetus uses the mother's body as its host. It depends solely on her for survival; no one else can step in and take her place if she is unhappy with the situation. If someone or something is using your body to survive, you should have a say in whether or not it is allowed to continue doing so. You should be permitted to decide what medical procedures you will undergo or forego. If you do not get to decide this, then your rights to bodily autonomy are being infringed upon. When the interests of the fetus and the mother collide, the mother should take precedence.   This, more than a lack of consciousness in the fetus, is why I support abortion at the discretion of the mother and no one else.

"You mentioned the term parasite so my question to you is does parasites posess the DNA which identifies us each as a human? And if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans? To the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus.  A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs. If the fetus is indeed a parasite then you are implying that all humans are parasites at the fetal stage and any doctors or scientist will prove you wrong.   The body of a woman is not infringed upon because the fetus is formed from a natural process of reproduction which involves the reproduction of human organisms developing into human beings. Parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body.  Also you said that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney. In this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power. And even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive? And what about newborns that are one day old? Don't they also feed from the body of the mother? Does that makes them a parasite?

"I am just going to repeat what I said before in different terms because I am not sure how I can make it any more clear.  A fetus makes its home inside the mother's body and leeches energy and nutrients from her, which is very taxing on her body. The fetus does not contribute anything in return. This is, without a doubt, the definition of a parasitic relationship. I don't know how you can interpret this relationship as the 'opposite' of what I stated as that would entail the mother leeching from the fetus without contributing anything in return.  The bodily autonomy of the woman  is  infringed upon  if  she doesn't want the fetus to continue using her as a host and she is forbidden from seeking an abortion.  Back to the patient: I admit that I am unfamiliar with legal complications like that. However, it still seems that everyone involved has a way of disentangling themselves from a situation of caring for a paralyzed person, if they wish to do so. The person with power of attorney can recuse, as you said, and doctors voluntarily take care of patients because it is their job. If they didn't like it, they could quit or transfer. No matter what kind of bizarre hypothetical one can pose with a paralyzed person, it is still not an issue of the caretakers' rights to bodily autonomy being challenged.  If you have a newborn baby and a mother who does not want to take care of that newborn baby, then the solution is simple; she gives up her rights to the baby and someone else takes care of it. It still needs her permission to be able to use her body for survival, but in this case, if she chooses not to grant it, it can survive in other ways. This is not the case with an inviable fetus.

"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus? You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well. If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence. And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.

"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus?   When she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit, her rights to her own body are being infringed upon. This is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself.    You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice.   Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return. The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. It often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous.    But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well.   You are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder? A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.   The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. This point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone.  Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. This sounds like a nightmare. The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they  must  undergo or what medical procedures they  may not  undergo.    If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence.   The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child  can  depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  able  to someone who will care for the child. Before the fetus is viable, it  cannot  depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  unable  to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, I would be all for this.     And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.   Since this is nonsense, I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.  --  In addition to my previous point, I would like to pose a hypothetical situation. Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and  force  one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of punishment? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.

"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.  New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, ""The Embryo as a Transplant"" (Scientific American, April, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship.  Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life. Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?

Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.    You do not need to imply that I am so stupid as to not realize a fetus and mother are not the same species. I have already pointed out that some definitions of parasitism include a stipulation about species, and others do not. The distillation of the relationship, however, as I have explained I don't know how many times, is that one organism takes without returning and one organism gives involuntarily without receiving. This exactly describes the relationship between both a mother and a fetus and a parasite and its host.  For the sake of not being stuck on this semantic point forever, I will stop using the term 'parasitic relationship' and use the phrase 'a relationship in which the fetus siphons resources without contribution and the mother gives involuntarily and may very well suffer ill consequences of varying severity due to the presence of the fetus'.    Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about.   I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only.   In America, the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder. This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder, and unless I am mistaken, the women who receive abortions, legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either.   What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries.    It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything. What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex. My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent.    You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.    It ruled the fetus is  alive . Not that it is equal to  a human life . Bacteria, plants, and chickens are  alive  but they are not  human lives . Do you understand the difference? If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder.   Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?   No, and neither can a fetus if you abort it.

Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite?

You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised.

One for the mother and one for the fetus. How is this psssible if the fetus is a parasite? And how does the human body not fight against the fetus but rather undergo changes to accept the fetus?  Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead.

If you are going to blatantly ignore them, I am not going to rephrase them  again .   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised.

Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?   Sorry, abortion is still not murder and yes, it should be a right to women.   I am not trying to claim that fetuses are dead, so I am not sure why you brought that up. I realize that they are alive. I just do not put that expression of life on the same level of the expression of life you see in actual conscious human beings.   Animals are alive but they are not considered human. That was kind of my point. Being composed of living tissue does not automatically mean you are a human and you get all the rights that come along with that.   Thank you. You said it yourself. Your skin cells cannot develop into a human or heart so stop comparing it to a fetus.   Don't ignore the part of the sentence that is inconvenient to you.

"The Laws have a rigght to infringe upon the body of anyone in order to control criminal activity especially since it was created by the majority of the people of this land.  I don't want to hear your reason. I need you to produce evidence pointing that the fetus is indeed a parasite. What is your opinion is your opinion but that does not mean you are correct. Everybody knows what a parasitic realtionship is but there is a deeper relationship here in which several elements of science were combined to provide a deeper scientific relationship. Scientifically, in order for the realtionship to be considered parasitic, therehas to be the elements of parasitism to exists. Those elements are not here. Let me put it this way for you, every adult person has personhood but if the elements of personhood are absent, it means that person does not have personhood at all even though some might consider him or her as having personhood. Again, i dont need to hear your opinions. If you want to prove your point, then produce evidence and i will believe you.  So who cares what is legal and what is not legal. Laws change all the time. Wasn't slavery considered legal? Isn't it illegal now? Aobrtion is the intentional taking of a human life and murder is also the intentional taking of a human life. Let me put it this way to you, I am standing holding a gun to a man's head, and i have two choices, one is to kill him and the other is not to kill him. If i kill him i will be doing something that is both morally and legally wrong. If i save him, i will be doing something that is both morally and legally right.   You still used the term fetus so the laws still apply to fetus and homicide which means that the fetus is still considered as human life.  But one of the laws of science in defining the term of life states that inorder for an individual to be referred to as having life, they have to be able to be distinguished from the dead. Again, not my opinion but the findings of scientists.  So is that why you want to kill a fetus? Because you know it will develop into a human being because according to you an aborted fetus cannot develop into a human being. Why would it develop into a human being if you already took the life of it? Furthermore, when a fetus is formed, organ formation begins about three weeks after the fetus itself is formed including a beating heart which pumps blood.  NB: When i mentioned the term ""you"" i am referring to pro choice supporters and not you specifically. Furthermore let me also be clear that i support spontaneous abortion and not induced abortion since spontaneou abortion since spontaneous abortion is beyond the control of the woman.

If you do not understand after this, I will not address the point again; this does not mean I am assuming I am correct by virtue of ending the argument, just that I have thoroughly exhausted all the evidence there is, only to have it ignored by you, and I am not longer going to waste time on it.  When two organisms interact on a biological level, they enter a symbiotic relationship. This relationship can be mutual, commensal, or parasitic. Mutual relationships are relationships in which both organisms involved reap a benefit. Commensal relationships are relationships in which one organism benefits, and the other is not affected at all. Parasitic relationships are relationships in which one organism benefits at the expense of the other organism.

Additionally, here are several sources that do not add the stipulation of species to the definition or parasite. Note that these are not simply English dictionaries, but biological dictionaries intended to define terms as they can be used in a scientific context.    http://biology-online.org/dictionary/ Parasite     http://en.mimi.hu/biology/parasite.html    http://www.wordiq.com/definition/ Parasite     http://www.medterms.com/script/main/ art.asp?articlekey=4769     So who cares what is legal and what is not legal. Laws change all the time. Wasn't slavery considered legal? Isn't it illegal now? Aobrtion is the intentional taking of a human life and murder is also the intentional taking of a human life.    It's the human life part you seem to be having a problem with. Yes, the fetus is alive, and it has human DNA, but I think it is foolish to place its life on the same level as, say, an actual baby. To do so is to say abortion is identical to the murder of a 6 month old baby.    Let me put it this way to you, I am standing holding a gun to a man's head, and i have two choices, one is to kill him and the other is not to kill him. If i kill him i will be doing something that is both morally and legally wrong. If i save him, i will be doing something that is both morally and legally right.   If another organism (human or not) is using a human being as a life support system, the human that is functioning as a life support system has a right to order the end of such a relationship. In your example, the man you are about to shoot is perfectly capable of living without using your body; if you wish to end your involvement with him, you can walk away. A woman who wants to get an abortion does not have this luxury, so the situations are incomparable in that respect. I posed a hypothetical situation in a previous post that I believe you also ignored:  Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and force one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of charging them with murder if they do not? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.   You still used the term fetus so the laws still apply to fetus and homicide which means that the fetus is still considered as human life.   The homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America because a fetus is not legally considered a human life. Do you live in country where they do, or do you live in fantasy America?   I also fail to see how my use of the term 'fetus' means that the law suddenly applies to it.    But one of the laws of science in defining the term of life states that inorder for an individual to be referred to as having life, they have to be able to be distinguished from the dead. Again, not my opinion but the findings of scientists.   You do realize that I am not arguing that the fetus is dead, right?   So is that why you want to kill a fetus? Because you know it will develop into a human being because according to you an aborted fetus cannot develop into a human being. Why would it develop into a human being if you already took the life of it? Furthermore, when a fetus is formed, organ formation begins about three weeks after the fetus itself is formed including a beating heart which pumps blood.   It is nonsensical to imply that anyone wants to kill a fetus  because  it will develop into a human being. People get abortions because they do not want to be pregnant, and pregnancy should be a voluntary process. If there was a way in which the pregnancy could be terminated and the fetus preserved, that would be ideal. As it is, no such thing exists, the interests of a fully developed and conscious human being should override the interests of a fetus that has no more consciousness than a human lung.   NB: When i mentioned the term ""you"" i am referring to pro choice supporters and not you specifically. Furthermore let me also be clear that i support spontaneous abortion and not induced abortion since spontaneou abortion since spontaneous abortion is beyond the control of the woman.   Even the accidental loss of human life merits an investigation, and it is quite possible to purposefully induce a miscarriage through many avenues. If a fetus is placed on the same level as a human being, then women who miscarried should be immediately subjected to an investigation and arrested for murder if it was determined she is at least partially responsible for the miscarriage, either through intention or negligence.

"It is not what you care about. What you think or care about is different from the view of the laws. Selling sex has to do with whether one has the freedom to choose in regards to their body which is however prevented by the laws.  You keep saying that the mother fetus relationship is parasitic but you are still failing to produce proper proof. The first evidence you produced is a blog. Who cares about a blog? Ablog is the exchange of information between people who talks about a subject. In the dictionary the term parasite was defined. Again anyone knows the definition of parasite so prove to me or produce any scientific findings that proved the fetus is a parasite. So far, you have failed to produce any proper evidence to prove that. All you keep doing is defining what the term parasite means and then applying it to the term fetus because of the existing relationship.   Source:   http://www.l4l.org/library/notparas.html                                           You seem to be forgetting that the fetus not only has a human identity but a separate human identity which identifies the fetus as another human being. The only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt. So why is it foolish? Organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being?   What do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America? Last time i had a conversation with a Judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses. And it is still in practice so where are you living in? In Fantasy America?  It seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey. According to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual, the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity MUST be able to be distinguished from the dead. If this rule exists, then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life.   Abortion again is the taking of a human life. Why do people not want to get pregnant? Because they are unable to accept responsiblity of the unborn for some reason or the other. So it is the process whereby the fetus is killed in a procedure.   If a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage, then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion. For an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not, there has to be intention to commit the action itself.

"It is not what you care about. What you think or care about is different from the view of the laws.   I hope you remember this very quote in a few minutes, when I point out  again  that abortion is not considered homicide because the law does not recognize a fetus as a human being, therefor does not extend the same protections to it. The fact that you  think  abortion is murder has no influence on whether or not the law considers abortion to be murder.  As I said, the parasitism issue will no longer be addressed because you continue to ignore very basic evidence and qualified unbiased sources, in favor of presenting me with a page from a pro-life website.   You seem to be forgetting that the fetus not only has a human identity but a separate human identity which identifies the fetus as another human being.   When the fetus is inside the mother, it is inseparable from her system, and its lack of a fully formed or functioning brain prevents it from developing or retaining an identity.   The only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt. So why is it foolish? Organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being?    That is so far from the only difference between a fetus and a six month old baby.In the fetus, the brain does not even possess all its parts. That is where the organ comparison comes in. It has absolutely nothing to do with their potential; it has to do with capacity for awareness. In this case, the organ and the fetus have equal capacity for awareness: none.  Six month old babies are capable of feeling pain, reacting voluntarily to external stimuli, and their consciousness is not contested in any form. I actually think it is kind of monstrous to suggest abortion is in any way comparable to killing an infant, implying that women who get abortions are exactly the same as people who beat their infants to death.   Note that when I use fetus, I am not referring to all fetuses but to fetuses before the stage of viability, well before the thalamus is formed or functioning. A fetus beyond the point of viability is another matter, I think, as the interests of both the fetus and the mother could be preserved through an early delivery or c-section.   What do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in America? Last time i had a conversation with a Judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses. And it is still in practice so where are you living in? In Fantasy America?   1. I already said I do not agree with this precedent and I think it is contradictory, again, unless the fetus is past the point of viability.  2. People who perform and receive abortions are not charged with homicide. How could this be true if fetuses were protected under homicide legislation?   It seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey. According to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual, the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity MUST be able to be distinguished from the dead. If this rule exists, then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life.   At no point did I contest any of the things you just mentioned. Why is this the third time you have repeated this? I have never said I think fetuses should be classify as dead. I have said numerous times I know they are alive. The fact that something is biologically classified as living is not what makes it a human life. Where is the disconnect? What do you not understand about this?   I am frustrated with your apparent refusal to understand simple statements, but please understand I am not asking the following question with the intent of being insulting or belittling. We are clearly having a problem understanding each other. Is English your first language?   If a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage, then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion. For an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not, there has to be intention to commit the action itself.   In order for one to determine whether a miscarriage was induced or spontaneous, they would have to investigate. Therefor, if a fetus was given the same rights as every other human, then every miscarriage would lead to an automatic investigation because every miscarriage could potentially be a murder. If it had been determined that the mother engaged in any activity that led to the miscarriage, even through negligence, she would be treated as though she contributed to the death of a human being, with all the legal punishment this entails.

So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well? Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.  Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus? Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?

The DA will institute a chage of homicide?

"Firstly, unless I missed it, you  still  have not answered my hypothetical question regarding mandatory organ donation to sick people. Why is this?   One thing we are taught in law is not to accept any fact until proper evidence is produced and you check those sources you produced and tell me what the problem is with them. You never used sources like that in an argument because of the validity of the facts become a question.

Point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus?   You gave me a page from a pro-life page, basically biased by default because they are trying to convince readers that their agenda is the correct one. I gave you four scientific and unbiased sources that defined a parasite-host relationship between two organisms. Not two species. Two organisms. If you cannot see how the fetus fits that definition, which you clearly cannot, then you are beyond being reached by explanation.   So are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well?   Perhaps. But, regardless, their life is not dependent on the body of another, therefor there is no need for their death if someone does not want to be involved with them. I am saying this to cut off another rebuttal about euthanizing comatose patients.    Our brian does not gives us identity. DNA gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it.   If it is not a brain or a consciousness that gives us our identity, but rather the simple possession of human DNA and the act of being kept alive by a heart, then again, I contend that a fetus and a human liver are equally alive and deserve comparable rights.    Why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus? Dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus?   This is absolute nonsense. I really have no idea what you are trying to say.    Abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive. If something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely, isnt that the process of killing it?   I think I have said before that nobody kills a fetus  because  it is alive, or  because  it has a heart. Please pay attention to the implications of sentence structure. People might kill a fetus because it is dependent on their body and they do not want it to reside in their body anymore, and there is no way to remove it without causing its death.    Again, i am in Criminal Law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws. So it isnt about what you agree with or not, it is about what the laws are. Why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant, the District Attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused?

I am not in criminal law so I almost hesitate to say this, but it seems as though you were taught false or, at best, misleading information.   http://www.chronline.org/ Feticide%20versus%20Homicide.pdf     But according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life (and i quote life not alive) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead. What part of this statement are you having a tough time with?    It's relevance.    Did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead? English is my first language. We are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence. I understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then? This is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states. That is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made. I dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life. I need evidence to back that up.   Okay. I think I understand your train of thought and why you keep harping on the whole not dead = alive thing. If this is incorrect, point out where I went wrong.  Anything that is distinguishable from the dead = alive  Anything that is alive = a life  The act of ending a life = killing  Killing = murder  Murder = homicide  If this is a correct summary of your line of thinking, then you draw no distinctions between different forms of life, their capabilities, and the rights they are afforded, and additionally, you draw no distinction between murder and any other method of ending any form of life. It would mean that shooting someone in pure self defense = homicide. Accidentally striking a pedestrian who was not in a cross walk = homicide. Slaughtering a chicken for food = homicide. Plucking a flower = homicide. Using antibacterial soap = homicide.   If this is incorrect, then I actually do not have any idea why you keep bringing this point up, because clearly you  are  capable of   a) distinguishing between different forms of life   b) realizing that life with higher functions are granted more rights under the law, and  c) understanding that the law does not protect any form of life from being ended by any means.   Every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it. The fetus is protected by human rights to certain extents.   People estimate that as few as 15% and as high as 78% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, many times before the woman even knew she was pregnant. Even on the low end of the estimate, that is a lot of women to subject to a homicide investigation directly after they experience miscarriage. Then, if it has been convincingly shown the abortion was not 'spontaneous' (how? I have no idea), then comes the problem of deciding how responsible a woman is. What if she smokes or drinks, possibly causing a fatally premature birth? What if she fell down a flight of stairs, how will she prove she didn't do it on purpose? What if she stays in a relationship with an abusive man who eventually beat her so bad she miscarried; is this not causing death through inaction? What if she didn't obey her doctor's order of strict bed rest? What if she went on a roller coaster ride or ate some sushi? What if she just stressed herself out too much? How much jail time do the women in each of these situations deserve?

"Frankly, anyone has the right to abortion because of free will and liberty, and nobody has the right to tell anyone what to do with their body.  HOWEVER,  The only problem I have is the definition of fetus and human.  If it is isn't murder, then why is that when a person murders a pregnant woman, whom is carrying a fetus, is charged with double homicide? How can that be? Where is the justice? Shouldn't it be only homicide? The person did in fact murder only one person because the fetus is not human

In the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt.

If you don't have a functioning body that can exist on its own, it follows that you lack developed organs, and even more importantly a developed brain. This means you lack awareness of your own life.  It would be nice if you researched the developmental stages of fertilisation through foetal development, and birth. Then you might appreciate the fact that while a fertilised egg is alive, it isn't a life, or at least not worthy of being granted the rights of a born human life.  The whole issue that you are so passionate about is actually over the killing of fertilised eggs and tiny, unaware foetuses.

So what im basecly trying to say is that aborting is not a way to solve things so i think it should just be illegal.

"Most abortions that occur are before it is even a foetus. The second most likely stage aborted is that in which the foetus is barely developed, barely has a brain and only might have a heart.  The figures are roughly 50% and 30% respectively.  I support abortion because we need mothers who want their child and are prepared to raise it well. What we do NOT need are unprepared, overworked mothers giving their babies to an already flooded adoption market, or attempting to raise a child that gets less than optimal care because the mother can't be there for him.

"First of all, don't argue about something you can't even spell correctly. Second, abortion is completely wrong whether or not it is economically beneficial to an adoption market. Third, if adoption is truly a market, then the correct name is human trafficking, and you mean to tell me abortion is fixing that? Please. Most abortions occur in high school teenagers, so an overworked mother is out of the question for the most part. I am so adamant about this because my mother had two abortions before my birth. I am now a junior in high school with a 3.48 GPA. Abortion is supposed to fix that?

"Thank you very much for that point you made.   I was also born out of child pregnancy and poverty. Today i am a student in pre law with a G.P.A of 4.0 and also a straight A student. Should i have been aborted i would have been robbed of my life and accomplishments.

"Ever think that it is because your mother had 2 abortions before you that you are doing well now? It is just as hypothetical to assume that those 2 abortions were just little yous that got denied a chance as it is to assume that those 2 abortions occurred at a time when your mother wasn't ready and when she was ready she did have you and you are being successful.  Hopefully people here aren't against adoption - it is one of the few options for mothers who can and do go through with a pregnancy even when the mother and or father cannot support the child.  One other thing to mention - while you may feel strongly that one choice is better than the other - making something legal or illegal should meet a different test; for example - if a woman is 5 months pregnant and finds out she needs chemotherapy - should the government force her to not get the treatment and risk killing herself and the child all at once? Government cannot imagine every potential abortion scenario and in a free country is not the one that should make those decisions.  Keep up the good work.

For your information again we are talking about the cells of the sperm and zygote which when fuse brings about the reproduction of a developing human being. Furthermore scientifically the fetus is referred to as a human organism. Define the term organism for me?  That statement you made is full of arrogance and wrongful judgment.

We are talking about the ""life of a developing human being for your information"".   Life is not ""a life"" intrinsically because it has no proper brain. A mass of cells knows nothing.  Now that I was born, I earned human rights.  Why give an unintelligent mass of tissues or cells human rights?   Why don't you save me some time and read up on that historic case i made reference to?   I don't care about it. The court has little relevance to reality. If it was a scientific journal, I would care.   For your information again we are talking about the cells of the sperm and zygote which when fuse brings about the reproduction of a developing human being. Furthermore scientifically the fetus is referred to as a human organism. Define the term organism for me?   It doesn't matter if the tissue is human. When you donate a kidney, is that kidney ""a life"" or just ""life"" Hmm? A foetus isn't self-aware.  Organism is the most inclusive term for life.   That statement you made is full of arrogance and wrongful judgment. Many of my friends who were born out of poverty or unpreparedness are now successful lawyers, doctors, singers etc? Would you say that they should have been killed as a child too. That does not make any sense at all.   What I said was a rational statement. I still support it no matter how you try to appeal to my emotions.  The simple fact is that abortion culls unwanted offspring from the population. A child should be wanted, and prepared for.  Go ahead. Try to make an argument that an unwanted child or a child raised as a burden are both GOOD things for society.

"No sometimes it is...there is a a type of pregnancy that kills the mother AND the fetus unless its aborted....I pretty much agree that abortion is wrong otherwise though!!

"But it is growing into a human being? Am i right or wrong? You should understand that these cells are different from the other cells within our body. Cells that are developing with it's own genetic uniqueness and has its own DNA and blood type. Then why do the laws protects that very mass of cells by recognizing the homicide of a fetus as a separate offense if it is unworthy of human rights according to you?  Well that case i am referring to has a lot to do with this debate because it is a dispute on whether or not life begins at conception and it is a scientific controversy which resulted in the court ruling that life begins at conception after hearing arguments from both sides. So does a person who has Alzheimer is also not self aware which is why they are described as being in the baby stage? Well let us consider adoption instead of abortion and stop making it seem as if abortion is the only way out. Who is responsible for bringing them into existence? Did they asked to be brought into existence or to be related?

Maybe you should have a look at our arguments and if i was unprepared for him, then how come i add him as my ally? I am not going to repeat myself because like i told aveske if the fetus is not a human then what is it? And doctors and the U.S Supreme Court has ruled that the fetus has life. I have proof of this. Lastly aveske referred to the fetus as a human organism. The deeper scientific meaning of the word organism refers to life so he himself referred to the fetus as human life.

"Suicide is not banned but at the same time, the state has every right to keep a person in custody if there is a chance that the person will hurt himself or there is a strong likelihood that the person is at risk of committing suicide. Let us not concentrate on the federal level as we are concentrating on state levels. The duty of the federal level is to prosecute and regulate laws that are in the best interest in the people of America not just a specific state. In other words, the federal government cannot and will not intrude upon the laws of a state. Prostitution and suicide are minor issues for them when the security of their country is at stake.

Why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare?

"When does life begins? Use a reference to support your claim.   Doesn't matter.  In cell culture life begins after the cells separate in mitosis.  We're talking about when a foetus has independent thought and recognises that it is being killed.

Should the number of feminist activists out there decide our choice to maintain womens' suffrage?   How many abortions results in death of the mother yearly?   You don't actually care about the mother, so why bring this up?  It's more of a loaded question anyway because most medical procedures have a mortality rate, and are legal.

"It is interesting that you bring that up. So if the fetus does not recognize that it is being killed then should we kill the mentally retarded too or the people that are paralyzed because they cannot recognize the fact that they are being killed or because their organs are not working? If all the cells in our body had died then wouldn't the human body die too? Isn't a cell the formation of tissues then organs then to the body systems?  It is funny that you say different topic when both are related to the point that it is questioned whether a woman has a right to control her own body or not. Why would it not be my business? If it wasn't any of our business then why do they make those record public. You want to know why? Because the public has a right to access those information.   I have a feeling that you wouldn't be able to tell me and i also think you wouldn't be able to tell me about the number of deaths in abortion cases. Again you are retreating from my questions and giving opinions rather than facts. I am puzzled by your response on the government. I need a fact and again not opinion. Well my goal is to become a criminal state lawyer so for your information we fight for the truth and we do not make opinions without facts because any court of law would take that into account against us. And again persuasion comes from a strong argument backed up by facts not opinions or refusing to say you don't care or refuse to answer to an argument because if you were in a debate the judges would already sanctioned and scolded you for that.

"Aside from religious views, there are more ways to look at abortion. By any means, abortion should never be encouraged because it is, indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life, save for our own. However, there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable.  First and foremost. Abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy - a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years. That is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done. If they had had sex, then it's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it. Thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems.  But, however, there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother's health at risk. If the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer, high blood pressure, it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy. For if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother, aren't we killing another life as well? Of course, it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take, but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother's life is at risk.

"well, it is a bad decision to have abortion. even if you had an emotional past or some effect that leads to having abortion, honestly the baby did not do anything to you. what happened to you should not have killed the baby. you call yourself human. taking a life is nothing to go on living or smiling about, and then how could you even begin to wake up everyday knowing you took your own baby's life.. it is cruel and such an evil thing to do.. and i am pretty sure its not our body but in soul were all connected and we never said it was ours to begin with.. your babies are human and deserved to be loved also.. how will they ever know if you end their lives.

Tell me honestly if you got an wanted child you would keep it because you think it is ""murder"". most people abort because they don't have the money to support that unborn child. What is better? Letting the child into a world of sh*t or spare it of what could have come. Why would you take the risk? Because if you do take the risk then and it turns out bad then it wouldn't only hurt the child's life, but yours too, and you families lives/economy. And in the long Run it will cost the country they live in a lot of money because if they can't provide someone has to get them money... Who'll do that?

"Abortion can only come down to one question: Is the fetus alive or not. If it is alive, then destroying it would be murder.

What if some of those people had become a burden on their family? Is it suddenly NOT murder any more?   Also, the difference between a fetus that can be destroyed in a 'Partial-birth"" abortion and a live baby that has full protection of the law is a distance of only a few inches down the birth canal. Killing it in the birth canal is the same as killing it in the womb.

As well, I cannot comprehend how anybody can think that their own choice trumps the right to the life of another; I am alive, if another life is alive because of me, but can be terminated by me at a moment's notice, in what universe is it acceptable for me to put my own personal desires ahead of that of the other life?

"It's definitely dishonest to present this as a picture of abortion in general, and sadly it preys on people who have no better source of information. Most women will not have abortions using this procedure, and their fetuses will not look at all like that. They probably will not even be recognizably human. If a woman went to a clinic, she would at least be told the truth about what would happen to her if she wanted an abortion.  However, D&E;is still in use today although it counts for a small fraction of all procedures. Abortions aren't pretty, no matter how they're done.

Her head now sits on her neck and you can even see the whorl of a hair pattern on the top of her head. Her head is still very large and makes up half the length of her body. Her eyes are moving closer together and her ears are continuing to form. She has taste buds and has developed the sucking reflex. She is beginning to practice her swallowing too. Teeth buds have also begun to form, as well as fingernails and toenails. Her major organs, as well as her sex organs have formed and are developing steadily. Your placenta has now developed and has taken over hormone production.""  Most abortions happen around this gestational age. Wow a lot happening eh? It is not just a glob of tissue.   THIS IS FACT. Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it. However barbaric…abortion should be celebrated and should be allowed…however horrendous it is.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions. You are blind to what the truth says.

"Most abortions happen after the heart starts beating.   And so?   However barbaric…abortion should be celebrated and should be allowed…however horrendous it is.   Even if it may seem horrendous, it does not necessarily imply that it ought not to be allowed or done. All you have done here is simply appeal to emotion and given no logical arguments for your position.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions.   Really? Let's think about it then. If a mother is definitely going to die very slowly and painfully if the baby is not aborted, is it more immoral to abort the baby or allow the mother to die a slow and agonising death?  Let me raise another scenario. What if a minor was impregnated by a violent rape and the rapist does not take responsibility for the child? Is it more immoral to leave a defenceless and helpless minor to care for a baby, a constant psychological reminder of rape, or for her to abort? I'm not talking about who you would have more sympathy for, but merely on what moral grounds do you have to say abortion is immoral.  By logic, you yourself have no good reason to be opposed to abortion.

"First of all, you further the previous point made about disinformation in how the quote you posted uses 'she' instead of 'they', attempting to personify the foetus further than it should be.   The truth is…from conception that which is in the womb is alive   Every single part of your body can be considered alive, except your nails and hair and a few others, I believe. Cutting off a piece of skin holds no moral issues for you, I would guess, it's a similar idea. Except a foetus will cost thousands of pounds/dollars/euros, will take thousands of hours of time, will restrict you throughout your entire life, cause you to be labelled because of it, and cause you to endure a huge amount of hardship from it. There are reasons for abortion as well, studies have shown that about three quarters of women choose them because of financial reasons, hardly their choice.   Why can't you pro-aborts just admit it   I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice.   You are the ones who can't face the facts in the moral debate on abortions. You are blind to what the truth says.   Actually, humans kill thousands of life forms every single second, just because it's seen as morally wrong there is a big issue with abortion. Why should it be morally wrong? Please give me a reason why it is so intrinsically bad to take a life with no emotion?  I would suggest that Pro-Lifer's are not necessarily blind to truth, they see it, they simply ignore the truth of what happens to those who are not allowed abortions. Abortion rates does not change massively when it is outlawed, all that happens is they do it illegally and unsafely. Further, the argument made by Republican candidates is that abortion should be outlawed to protect the 'nuclear family'. Hardly relevant, as typical, married, happy, nuclear families would not get abortions a significant amount of the time. Give me a convincing argument as to why abortion is so bad.

"Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortion…there is no difference. They don't like the label however but its the truth. I just got banned from a place because I refused to stop using the term pro-abort to describe someone who …DOES NOT WANT LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE LIVING HUMAN BEING IN THE WOMB. This is not a pro-life person. This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselves…is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE.   THEY ARE PRO-ABORTS. I can just see someone at a Right to Life convention…standing up and saying…."" I am pro-life but believe that women should have the choice to kill."" They would be laughed out of the room.  There is no difference between someone who is pro-abortion and someone who is pro-choice…they want the same thing….legalized killing.   Cutting off a piece of skin….compared to stopping a beating heart of a human in the womb…..you think is the same thing? Laughable…won't even comment.  You probably no doubt think that killing a bug is the same as killing a human being….hey they are both alive right?  Yes babies are costly. How much did your parents foot the bill for your maintenance? At least your mother allowed you life…and you are here debating and defending the rights of other mothers…to kill, to take away the rights of others. What is it that Ronald Reagan said…it was so true.  “Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.”  Question….I know you are pro-abortion. Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months? Oh I can't wait to see just how many rights you give women….to own their bodies.   Why is abortion bad you ask?   You said and I quote….""I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice.""

"Ok, I'm amazed you're actually being this ridiculous about a simple name.   Anyone who is pro-choice is pro-abortion…there is no difference.   Pro abortion means you want abortions. Pro choice means you want the choice of abortions. There is a  big  difference.  I do not like that people get abortions. I simply think it's the lesser evil of two, especially when you look at statistics that show that abortion laws don't stop abortions, they just stop safe abortions. This leads to major risks to both the baby and the mother.  It's common for pro lifers to accuse pro-choice supporters of being blind to the facts, when it is they who rarely actually consider the women that they're condemning.   Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?   I think it's bad, I'm asking you why it's so bad. You haven't answered any of my questions, you've simply said that it's bad and that it's the same as pro-abort.   Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months?   Please talk about questions that are actually up for debate, you're wasting your time, attacking something that isn't there.   “Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.”   Useless circular rhetoric, sounds clever, but it proves nothing.

"And people who are pro-choice want abortions legal. They want laws in place that give the woman the option of killing. And if we had a nationwide vote…and a pro choicer voted…which would he vote…..Pro-choice abortion or no abortion?   So you think abortion is bad…but yet you want it legal so others can do it. LOL  Abortion is taking a life and that is bad. Abortion procedures are inhumane,,,we don't even do it on animals like we do humans.  Nothing is good about abortion.   Now I know why you won't answer the …do you believe the woman has the right to kill throughout her entire pregnancy? Because if you say yes…then wow…you look terrible even to the pro-choicers who use viability as an excuse,,,and if you say no…then you enslave the woman and your excuse that abortion should be legal because its the woman's body and should be her decision….is shot down.

So you think abortion is bad…but yet you want it legal so others can do it. LOL   Yes, pretty much. I think religion is bad, but I'd never consider taking it away from people. I think war is bad, but it can still be valid. I think people being a dick is bad, but I think it is their right. There's lots of things I don't like that I would still support. Just as Voltaire said  'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it' , I feel the same way about abortion.   Nothing is good about abortion.   That's not true.  No, I do not. Without being an expert in biology, I'm leaning towards a 'first trimester' option, to me that seems to be the commonly accepted medical grounds. Makes sense, after that the foetus becomes too lifelike, and the emotional trauma is too great. Also, how could you possibly give her the right the whole way through, when she's in labour, that's ridiculously impossible. A time limit makes sense.   We are given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitution   No, you are. I am not American. Please do not assume that everyone you meet on the internet is American, especially when I've written so in my 'about me'.  Yes, but the constitution is a legal document, it can easily be flawed. Just because it's there doesn't make it right, you must verify what you say.  And further, if you did accept it as truth, that only applies to citizens. When a foetus has citizenship, it gains the right to life. To do that, it must be born. So there you go, another circular impossibility, can't gain protection unless it's born, when it doesn't need protection.

"What could we show that you would find acceptable as the picture of abortion. You people do not care about medical facts, scientific facts. IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST TO YOU. You want abortion legal…on demand period.   The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 days…..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Now I know what our laws say…that killing should be an option for women. But tell me….what would you call killing a living human being without its permission? The unborn can't speak for themselves.   It does not matter what the procedure is…it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn. It is killing by burning, scrapping, dismembering, vacuuming the child until its dead. That is every abortionists goal. The unborn has to be killed in the womb….not outside. This picture is accurate and shows abortion. Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic….it puts action to reality…it gives a face to what they condone.

"I am actually pro-abortion but pro-choice will suffice. Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...   - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)

I've yet to see anyone ask a pro-lifer this question; what if a fifteen year old girl is raped, impregnated, and still in school and her parents are unable to support the baby, while the rapist is never caught?     2. Many abortions take place because a family cannot support the baby, or the baby will have some sort of mental disorder to prevent him/her from living life to the fullest.

"You are ignoring the fact that most abortions are for convenience, not rape or any medical need. The most common reasons women consider abortion are:  Per webmd.com ""The most common reasons women consider abortion are: 1. Birth control (contraceptive) failure. Over half of all women who have an abortion used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant.2 Inability to support or care for a child. 3. To end an unwanted pregnancy. 4. To prevent the birth of a child with birth defects or severe medical problems. Such defects are often unknown until routine second-trimester tests are done.5. Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. 6. Physical or mental conditions that endanger the woman's health if the pregnancy is continued.  If the pro-life community were to all agree today that all rape victims should be given abortions (if desired) and then loved without reservation until they are (somewhat) whole again, the pro-abortion industry would give not one inch on their opposition to any restrictions on unlimited abortions. The 'pregnant rape victim' is a red herring, meant only to emotionalize the issue in their favor.

"I would be more than happy answering this question.  1. Rape is a violent crime, a violent act. The rapist should be caught and serve punishment. The woman is the victim for sure. And the child she might be carrying also is a victim. ESPECIALLY IF SHE THINKS TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT AND DECIDES TO KILL IT.   There is always adoption. In most communities there are Crisis Pregnancy Centers that help women in situations like this. Free medical care…etc.  2. What right do you have to presume you know how someone will life and what quality of life the person might have? You have no right. Oprah came from a household that was poor, she was also a victims of abuse. Look at her now. One of the most successful and rich women in the country, in the world.   There is no family…that does not suffer bad things. There are families with drug and alcohol users, families who are poor, divorced…no family skates through life with no trials.

"What could we show that you would find acceptable as the picture of abortion.   Pretending pro-life people care about scientific fact is bullshit. Not that it's impossible to be scientifically honest and still be pro-life, but so many outspoken pro-life people and groups who have no problem using misinformation, emotional blackmail, intimidation and deceit to manipulate people into doing what pro-life thinks is right. Pro-choice people don't have to lie, because they don't care if no one chooses an abortion as long as they aren't being lied to or bullied. In fact, I think you'd find most pro-choice people would agree that the fewer people need/want abortions, the better. But being dishonest or cruel is not the way to go about making that happen.   Why are D&E;illustrations so commonly used for pro-life propaganda when D&E;accounts for less than 5% of all procedures? Not because it's an honest representation of what most abortions look like, because it isn't. It's because it's supposed to be scarier and more guilt-inducing. If you show this picture to an average woman who is considering an abortion and tell her this is what her procedure will look like, you are probably lying to her.   (I'm not the one putting the semicolon after D&E;, the website is doing that.)   You want abortion legal…on demand period.   You got it.    The fact is abortion is the act of KILLING A LIVING HUMAN BEING. THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT. The heart starts beating around 22 days…..THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT.   Please show me where I denied that a fetus is a human. Oh wait, I didn't, because I'm not an idiot. Of course a fetus is a human- did you expect me to claim it's a different species? The argument for abortion is sometimes concerned with  personhood , not the presence of homo sapien DNA and you're getting the two confused. But I think abortion would still be acceptable even if the government extended legal personhood to fetuses. One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.   But tell me….what would you call killing a living human being without its permission.   Abortion if it's a fetus, murder if it's not. It's cool how there's two different names for that, isn't it? That's so we don't get them confused.    It does not matter what the procedure is…it outcome is the same thing. Death to the unborn.   Oh shit, really?! Well then call me pro-life! Or don't, because I already knew that. Maybe say some more obvious things.    Those who are pro-abortion of course would not like this pic   I'm fine with it. It's not pretty but it's a fairly realistic representation of an uncommon medical procedure. Medical procedures generally are not pretty. It's the use of it to scare women who won't even be getting this procedure that I have a problem with.   Most doctors try to save lives. And abortionists kill lives.   More obvious things! If there is someone here who didn't realize abortion exterminates a living thing, I'm sure they'll thank you.

"Abortion is wrong because it takes a life.   Is the taking of a life  necessarily  wrong?   Do you think two wrongs make a right?   No. But I don't think that abortion is  necessarily  wrong. It is wrong in some situations, but it cannot be considered to be completely wrong.   Abortion is wrong whether the woman was raped or not.   But you haven't explained why abortion is wrong. Saying that it is wrong because ""it takes a life"" doesn't say anything because you are making the assumption, without any justification, that taking a life is wrong.   If you think all life is sacred then how could I think less of the baby whose mother was raped?   I don't think that all life is sacred. I don't believe in the sanctity of life.

What you are  really  doing here is ignoring the rights of the mother in favour of the unborn child, whom we don't know will even survive birth or the first few years of its life.   Red Herring?   Yes, it is a red herring. In your previous comment, you haven't asserted how your Oprah Winfrey example supports your argument that abortion is immoral.   Should she have been aborted simply because she had shady relatives…or that they were poor?   Not necessarily. I haven't made a judgement on Oprah at all so don't you dare put words in my mouth.

Do you think if you went into a hospital nursery full of babies and the nurse told you to pick out the baby whose mother was raped…think you could do it?   That has no relevance to whether the baby should have been aborted or not. Again, you can't abort an born child. That is an illogical statement.

Taking a life like this is wrong. In war…two sides are fighting. Our servicemen and women sign up to go…they take risks. What risk does an unborn take? How can you possibly compare the two? You can't. War is about protection….how can the unborn fight for its protection?   Well obviously you don't think life is sacred…your pro-abortion.

But once a life has started….those rights should be put on the back burner until the child is born…then she also has rights to decide what to do with it. Keep it or adopt it out. Its nine short months…to do what is right…to allow something to live…THAT YOU HELPED CREATE. AFter conception it is a separate human being…this is a scientific fact. A FACT. You propose to kill human beings…you say this is ok.   How barbaric and cold is that?  It should not matter whether the child will make it or not. If it doesn't and dies…then it was meant to be. Abortion is premeditated killing. Nothing spontaneous about it….you hire someone to kill someone…in this case the unborn child in the womb….who was invited in BY THE MOTHER, BUT HER RISK HER CHOICE.  I gee the Oprah example to show that…the argument by pro-aborts does not hold water. Most pro-aborts say abortion is good because……the child might have problems…might grow up in poverty……might face lives trials….  I GOT NEWS FOR YA……WE ALL FACE TRIALS. Oprah did in her life…and she overcame them. She grew up in a home that was not healthy or functional. To kill because you think someone MIGHT FACE A SIMILAR LIFE…is still wrong.

"You obviously feel killing is ok, I do not.   I have never made this claim. You are putting words in my mouth.   You don't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion.   That is because I don't think abortion is wrong  in every circumstance . I think some people have the wrong motivations to abort a baby and/or under the wrong medical circumstances, making  some  abortion cases morally wrong.   I give it personhood   But the idea of personhood is something that you have not defined clearly. If you want to argue on the basis of personhood, then a baby within the first trimester doesn't even have a brain to speak of. It, therefore, doesn't have the ability to  feel , let alone reason, within the first trimester.   War is about protection….how can the unborn fight for its protection?   You are comparing the two wrongly. War is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself. Even if I were to accept that the unborn baby is a person (which is a view that I do not  necessarily  agree with, as I've explained above), then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life-threatening illness!   Well obviously you don't think life is sacred…your pro-abortion. LOL   I'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour. That just goes to show how frivolous you are. What a hypocrite. And, by the way, I don't think  human  life is sacred and I don't believe in the sanctity of human life. If you think that life is sacred, then you, by logical deduction, should not be able to eat anything that has life (i.e. animals and even vegetables and fruits).   Its nine short months…to do what is right…to allow something to live…   You are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through  during  the nine ""short"" months. Furthermore, you said ""allow something to live"", right? If the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother, then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the MOTHER to live. If you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby, are you doing what is ""right""?   AFter conception it is a separate human being   It is not. As I have explained, the baby is not a human being within the first trimester. Furthermore, the unborn baby, no matter at any stage, is dependent on it's mother  completely  for nutrition. In other words, the baby is, technically speaking, a  parasite . The Oxford English Dictionary defines a ""parasite"" as ""Biol. An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and draws its nutriment directly from it. Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc."" Thus, by definition, the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body  AT THE EXPENSE OF HER OWN HEALTH .   How barbaric and cold is that?   Which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not. Or whether it should be legal or not. This is simply an appeal to emotion.   It should not matter whether the child will make it or not.   Then, whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you. Pro-choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision. They do NOT promote abortion, simply the  legalisation  of abortion. If you can't see the difference, then you're an idiot.   Abortion is premeditated killing.   And so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live. If the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, by not aborting the child, you are also premeditating the killing of the mother. Thus, by your standards, you face a paradox. I am appalled by how people can call themselves ""pro-life"" when they say that the mother's life doesn't matter as long as the baby is not aborted. This is hypocrisy of the greatest degree.   Most pro-aborts say abortion is good because……the child might have problems…might grow up in poverty……might face lives trials….   I am not a ""pro-abort"". I am pro-choice, as I have explained the difference.   So don't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life….so full of misery that they would be better off dead.   You are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery. Thus, you are attacking a straw man. Poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been ""allowed to survive"" face.   You said this….""Again, not necessarily. I support abortion only when a foetus can't be confidently said to lack rationality, autonomy  and self-consciousness.""  Now wait one minute here. Can a newborn baby do any of these? No.   Of course it does. It has autonomy and self-consciousness. But then again, even if I agree with you, by saying that a newborn baby can't have such experiences, it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral. Thus, your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand.   Are you telling me that you want abortion legal….because the woman has a right to her own body   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer is ""no"". Congratulations, you have proven that you at least have  some  level of intelligence.

"My argument is very simple.   By having sex, one acknowledges the possible repercussions of that act. Primarily being 1) being impregnated and 2) getting an STD.   By having sex, one realizes it might end up Ina pregnancy. No form of protection is 100% effective. So anyone having sex should be able to have the responsibility of having a child.   Why should the irresponsibility of the patents result in the death of the fetus? It is life. It is human life from a few hours after conception when the gander has become a zygote with the DNA addition of the father. The killing of human life is not a fair outcome for someone not at fault for anything.

"Why should the irresponsibility of the patents result in the death of the fetus?   First, I doubt that you can call the use of contraception ""irresponsible"". The fact that the contraception failed to prevent pregnancy does not mean that the parents were irresponsible, they were merely unlucky.  Second, your other premise is the the zygote is a human life. According to the OED, a zygote refers to ""A body of living protoplasm, as a cell or cell-nucleus, formed by the conjugation or fusion of two such bodies in reproduction; a zygospore, or any germ-cell resulting from the union of two reproductive cells or gametes."" While I admit that the zygote is ""alive"" in that sense, it does not have human rights because a zygote is not a sentient human being.

"doubt that you can call the use of contraception ""irresponsible"".   No. But contraception is not 100% effective. Even with protection, the parents are fully accept g (or rationally should be) that a pregnancy is a possible outcome of their...activities. So to have sex, even with protection, one should be ready to accept the potential outcomes, however unlikely.   Second, your other premise is the the zygote is a human life.   Human=homo sapien. A zygote has the DNA of a homo sapien. It is obviously alive. You are too smart to argue that it is dead. Life is a scientific definition for our proposes so it is inappropriate for you to cite the OED.    a zygote is not a sentient human being.   Did you think I wouldn't notice your clever addition? It is a human being (organism). You can't argue against that.

I can give thousands of definitions from the OED which is very much inline with the scientific community's. You raised the example of ""theory"". According to the OED, a ""theory"" refers to ""A conception or mental scheme of something to be done, or of the method of doing it; a systematic statement of rules or principles to be followed"" or ""A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed.""

I have no interest in arguing the difference in morality between two identical organisms whose inly difference is mental and physical development.   Then this debate isn't for you. Rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are the characteristics that sentient beings are supposed to possess, and this is not exhaustive. The concept of sentience  is  one of the bedrocks of the abortion debate. If you are not willing to address this issue, then you shouldn't even be debating here in the first place.

"I've agreed with a lot of your argument, but I'm particularly disturbed at the part where you say, ""One human should not use another human as a life support system unless the host is giving ongoing consent. This applies regardless of the age or legal status of either party or the relationship between the parties. If it's in your body and you don't want it there, you have a right to try to find someone who will take it out.""  This line of thinking is  rational , but some women would use it to justify promiscuity. I believe in abortion in cases where:  - the mother and/or father are too young to support a child, or the mother and/or father are in a situation that would not be a positive environment for a child (ie, abusive relationship(s), poverty/homelessness, etc.);  - the mother's/fetus's life is at risk,  - the fetus is the result of a rape or incestuous encounter;  - the fetus has a  very  high chance of developing some debilitating disease/malformation that will make its developing life difficult.  In women who are promiscuous and take no time to learn about/use contraceptives, they should not use abortion as a Plan B. If they are not ready for a child, and plan to have sex, then they should learn more responsibility and practice safe sex, not just  assume  they won't get pregnant.

"How so?   The mere fact that they were using contraceptives (correctly, of course) means that they were being responsible because their intention was not to have a baby and to avoid the choice of an abortion in the first place. If the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own, then it is not their fault! You can't accuse them of being irresponsible if the contraceptive fails in this manner. That would be like blaming the Haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were ""irresponsible"".   semantics...

Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   By that I mean anything that would in all likelihood result in the child's death.

It is perfectly normal for a child's brain to develop.   So what? That was not my point.

The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring. By making it a pleasure activity, you corrupt its true purpose. Now this is fine as long as one is prepared for that stupid, implausible. far-fetched, unlikely, ludicrous scenario where... what is actually supposed to happen happens. Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   So how would you define a ""scientific definition""?   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Effects on rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness are all defects.   And none of which are usually fatal.

If death is the result in either case, why put the parents through unneeded trauma? And my argument of choice falls apart in cases of rape, thus, it is my only other exception.   That was not my point.   An immature brain is not a defective one.

If you were to argue this point, you would be going down a very slippery slope. Furthermore, an appeal to nature is hardly a cogent argument.   The sole purpose of sex is to produce offspring.   I think that you'll find yourself to be wrong there.   Protection and contraception help reduce this likelihood, but it is not 100% effective.   But that is not the fault of the people using the contraceptives.   I think we may be getting away from the point...   Nope. I don't think so.

It doesn't have to be fatal to be bad or wrong. The point is that if an organism lacks rationality, autonomy  and  self-consciousness, it is no more than a mechanical machine that can be terminated without such an act being considered morally wrong.   However, you go beyond cases were the baby will die anyway to all cases.   I admit that. But you haven't actually posed any significant challenge to me on those cases.

If you have the audacity to claim that, I would say that you have less knowledge of Geography that my 5 year old nephew.   How does human not equal homo sapien?   I don't believe that was what I said. Homo sapien is a species of animals. To be human, one must also possess personhood. According to Dr. Mianna Lotz from the Centre of Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne, whom I've had the pleasure to meet recently, ""Personhood is generally defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self.""   I am only in favor of abortion in cases where it would be fatal.   Conversely, even when the effect of an action is fatal, it doesn't necessarily mean that the action itself was wrong.   I have indeed. They new the consequences. They ignored them.   That is an extremely feeble argument. How can someone ignore unforeseen circumstances?

"Per EHow.com...""The are five methods used when performing an abortion. The first is called Manual Vacuum Aspiration and can be used early in the pregnancy. The doctor inserts a thin tube into the woman's uterus and sucks the embryo out with the syringe attached at the end of the tube. The second, Suction Curettage, is the most common kind of abortion and can be performed later in the pregnancy. The doctor must stretch the cervix with rods, due to the size of the baby, and then inserts a plastic tube that is connected to a suction machine. Once inserted, the baby's body is and suctioned out in pieces. The third is called Dilation and Evacuation and is considered a second trimester abortion. At this stage, the baby is too big to be broken apart by only the use of suction. Seaweed rods are inserted into the woman a day or two before the procedure to stretch her cervix. The doctor will use forceps to pull the fetus out of the woman. A looped knife called a curette is used to scrape remaining fetal parts out of the woman's body. The fourth method is called a Dilation and Extraction, and can be through full term. This procedure takes three days, and during the first two, seaweed rods are used again to stretch the cervix. The doctor will then use an ultrasound to locate the baby's legs, taking them with forceps and pulling every part out with the exception of its head. He will then make a cut into the baby's skull, suctioning out its brains which, makes it easier to pull the baby out of the woman's body. Finally, there is the development of RU 486, an abortion pill. Early in her pregnancy, a woman is given a pill in the doctor's office to abort the embryo and is sent home with 2 to 3 pills to be inserted vaginally. This will induce stomach cramps and expel the embryo.

The sheer magnitude of unnecessary abortions performed these days reflects the gross irreverence for life that is so pervasive.

As it is a difficult experience, I don't doubt makes some women stronger. It could also break her or ruin her life if she can't deal with it, or if her life simply has no room for the resources pregnancy requires. There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.  I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not. You and I are both in situations that we could undoubtedly complicate by taking on more responsibilities or demands, but we haven't because we're aware that we have our limits and everything will suffer if we overextend ourselves. Is that unacceptable?    If the burden of proof was on you, I suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre-pregnancy level.   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.  The most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness. A negative impact on mental health is rare. It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/3/gpr090308.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/safety_of_abortion.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                        facts/post_abortion_issues.html

"""The most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness. A negative impact on mental health is rare. It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.""  I want to take issue with what you said here.  How do you know what women feel after abortions? You have no clue whatsoever and neither do the professionals. I talk here from experience, one who knows who has gone through this.  Most women suffer silently if they have had abortions. This is not acceptable table talk at the dinner table or any table for that matter. Not many woman I know want to talk about what they did…who wants friends and family to know they killed a family member? No women do not report it…they don't talk about it. They try to FORGET IT.   This is not so easy. Last Sunday was Right to Life Sunday and our pastor gave a sermon on this. I can only imagine how many women were sitting there who had had an abortion and were suffering. Its why most pastors won't even touch the issue. Lets not make women feel bad. Lets hide it.  I work with a group Silent No More. We minister to women and families and friends who are suffering from abortions. Abortion affects not just the woman but her family…that is if she tells them she had an abortion. I have worked in this field for over ten years…and the stories and tears I have seen…is unbelievable.   Do not say women do not suffer. That is propaganda that pro-aborts, that Planned Parenthood wants people to think. If you asked the majority of women however if they think about it…regret it you would be shocked…that is if they had the guts to admit again they had one.   Its funny isn't it that…the most performed surgical procedure in America…and we don't talk about it. How many women tell family and friends…hey can't meet for lunch going to get an abortion.  Does not happen for all the obvious reasons.

"Go back to my previous post and find the part where I said something to the effect of the following: ""No woman has ever experienced any negative emotions after getting an abortion.""  If you can do that, your response won't have been mostly a waste of time.    How do you know what women feel after abortions? You have no clue whatsoever and neither do the professionals.   You wouldn't have to ask this if you read the source I provided. How did researchers reach the conclusion that most women feel relieved after an abortion? They asked them. They administered surveys to women who underwent abortions and asked them to explain how they felt about the process. 76% said they felt relieved. The data doesn't agree with your stance, learn to deal with it.    http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/ Phil%207570%20Website/aAdler1990.pdf     I talk here from experience, one who knows who has gone through this.   You know people who have regretted abortions, so it's impossible that most abortion patients are okay with their procedure? This is blatantly biased. Your subject group is heavily skewed: women who are happy with their abortions obviously won't come looking for abortion healing so they're not nearly as visible to you. It's fallacious to assume your experience is representative of everyone's.   For the women who do feel guilt or depression: how much of that is owed to the prevalence of the idea that they  should  feel terrible for getting abortions? If family and/or society is unsupportive or hostile to women who choose abortion, or if they're even perceived that way, doesn't it make sense for at least some of them to be negatively impacted by that?  I really hope you don't bring your accusatory and condemning attitude to your interactions with women who are struggling with their abortions.

"I don't want to spend a lot more on this because the I'd be getting tangled in semantics   Fair enough. Really though I have this inclination to point out that what we call facts rest on subjective judgment, so I threw the word around loosely trying to illustrate that.    What makes an option better than abortion?   How about for starters it's likelihood to promote a culture of responsibility as opposed to the avoidance thereof.   Who has the authority to place someone else's reproductive options in order of goodness?   A hospital, A government, A trusted consultant.   How do you know other options weren't given fair consideration and discarded?   By noticing that accidental pregnancy invariably begins with a lack of consideration for, and discarding of smarter options. In general, abortions are the gross finale of a series of poorly considering ones sexual options. Sexual arousal, intense enjoyment, and climax can be achieved just fine while opting to avoid coitus and instead participating in mutual masturbation, oral sex, toys and other diversions. But that requires too much effort, heck demanding the use of a condom is for plenty of people, too much to ask. We'd have such a better situation if people would only have sex (I'm referring to the kind pregnancy results from) with partners they have seriously vetted as being worthy as partners in procreation. If cheap thrills weren't an acceptable substitute for genuine intimacy we'd be on to something. Abortion would be no where near as common. End of digressive rant.   You used it once in one way, and once in another way.   I went back and reread my posts. I don't notice myself doing what you claim. I try to be clear, and lay myself open to scrutiny. If you don't think it would be nit picking, by all means help me understand my misuse of a term.   I don't think it's fair to claim people who seek abortions do so because they haven't been diligent in seeking other options.   Well look there...we disagree...maybe....how about not all of them but a great deal of them then?   What are you using to support this claim?   I hope you find my rant above relevant and it gives you something to thoughtfully consider/refute.   Why can't abortion simply be the best option, even if the mother is not a rape victim or in danger of dying?   Well it's just my opinion, but the best way for a pregnancy to conclude is with the birth of a healthy baby.   They have a neutral impact on physical health. So they do not maintain, restore, or improve health.  If you want to include mental health, I wouldn't argue these procedures have no impact   Since I can't draw a clear distinction between physical and mental health (And I don't suspect you can either), I'll take that as a carefully worded concession. :)   Using guilt or shame to influence a woman into keeping an unwanted pregnancy would be harmful to her mental health- do you think this is true?    No more so than using guilt or shame to influence a parent to take better responsibility for their child(ren). My thoughts tend toward how people are pressured  into  abortions, even when they don't want them, with statements like ""it will ruin your life"" etc.. Abortion is propagandized as a way to insure scholastic, professional or financial success, and it's made to seem like getting pregnant is necessarily a detriment to those aspirations. In general do you think more pressure is exerted to promote abortions or to discourage them?   There is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty.   - No doubt - It's a sign of the deepest sort of poverty to make a decision to abandon responsibility for our own species while they're in the earliest stages of development. Even miscarriages are due to poverty.   I don't think it's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path, mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not.   Having serious doubts about our ability to handle parenting alone is normal and healthy. But if it's wrong to use shame to get people to take responsibility for their actions, it's even more wrong to use it to encourage them to abandon them. Besides shame is a great motivator, and no one can  make  someone feel shame without their permission right?   An abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures. It's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre-pregnancy health level.   Thanks for sharing your subjective opinion. :)   A negative impact on mental health is rare.   How did you learn that?   It would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they didn't want.   Who is pressuring women to get an abortion when they don't want it?

"IMO people have a right to receive treatment from whomever they choose, without restrictive legislature, or an invasion of privacy.  Since opinions like mine are a distinct minority, and I don't expect radical change any time soon, I am stuck arguing for the improvement of the quality or justness of laws that address issues beyond what I consider to be the proper domain of public legislature in the first place.  Take as an example marriage. I don't like paying taxes for judges to hear cases about marriage, child support etc..  I did NOT say that abortion is a gross irreverence for life. I said ""The sheer magnitude of unnecessary abortions performed these days reflects the gross irreverence for life that is so pervasive.""  I believe that there ARE cases where the decision to perform an abortion is made with the best interests of the mother in mind, and with fair consideration of her situation, and what can be accomplished with the doctors current skills. I believe abortion should be something a woman is..to paraphrase Zombee...""faced with"", not something she seeks out.  On the other hand....  I really don't think it's the business of government to disturb the privacy of doctor/patient relationships, or to make restrictive laws concerning an individual's choices for medical treatment. Such laws ARE in place however, so I'll talk about how I'd like them to change, since it appears they won't just go away.  I am pro-life in that I think abortion is an ugly thing that shouldn't be encouraged when it's clearly avoidable.

"You oppose legal protection for unborn children.   And you  impose  it, whilst opposing that for the mother. In most developed countries, people have the option to choose what they want, not be told what they want and have it forced on them (or at least that's the idea).  You repeatedly fail to see how those supporting pro choice do not like abortion, they simply support the choice of it. Simply because it's bad doesn't mean it should be outlawed.  For example, all conflict is bad. But that doesn't mean that without conflict, we'll all be happy. Debate is a form of conflict, if instead of talking about issues would we be happier?

"I am antichoice abortion. I am also antichoice drugs…and rape….and child pornography.

If not then you enslave someone from doing something with their body. So you are anti-choice. So why do you fault me for being antichoice abortion?  I believe that science established the fact that the life in the womb is a separate human being from its mother. It does not share organs…does not have the same finger prints…etc. It is simply using the space to grow. It did not ask to be there it was invited by its mother. It was her body also that invited the sperm into the space where conception took place. She is the one who knew what could happen….when she had sex. She took the risk. She should be responsible for what happens. It was her risk and fault…not the unborns.   I am forced everyday to do things I don't want to do. I hate seat belts…but I am forced by law to wear them. And texting in the car. Who should have the right to stop someone from doing this if they are careful. Its their phone…its their car. THEY TAKE THE RISK JUST LIKE THE WOMAN DOES WHEN SHE HAS SEX. We all live by rules many we don't like. I do not like abortion.  I do not fail to see anything…I see things crystal clear. Anyone that opposes protection for the unborn is pro-abortion.

"You know what puzzles me……?  Here we have a picture that the pro-abort side DOES NOT WANT SHOWN. It factually is true and this is how a later term abortion happens. It happens the same way however in earlier abortions…the baby is just smaller. But never the less body parts still are dissected and torn from the fetus alive…until it is dead. So this is the face of abortion…FACT.   What gets me is this. Most everyone here I presume is pro-choice. Why?  They believe that the woman should have the rights to her body and that its a personal decision that only she can make. She should not be burdened by carrying something she does not want…and she may do this for any reason. Abortion should be legal so that if she decides to kill her baby she can.   So why does this picture…upset pro-aborts/choicers? If they embrace abortion for all the right reasons….then what is so wrong with it?   Is killing a living human being bad? No says the pro-choice side. Why the emotion from this side for being called pro-abortion? Is there something your not telling us? Certainly you don't advocate something you find immoral..right?   If abortion should be legal…because its the woman body her decision. Then how many of you would agree that even late term abortions like this….are ok?

"It is a choice. And when abortion was illegal the majority of women had their babies. Less women got pregnant because they knew that abortion was really not an option…it was hard to find illegal abortion clinics and doctors that would perform them.

You either want abortions legal…or you want protection for the unborn and want it illegal. One thing your not…Pro-life…not if you want abortion legal. Thats like child abuse. Looking away you know its wrong but its your neighbors right to do it. Do you help the children no.   Now rape is a serious violent act and it is wrong. But that which is created is still a child, innocent at that. It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped. So the rape is one violent act…and abortion is the next. The mother chooses to violently end her childs life.   I have known people who have used birth control but still got pregnant. Accidents happen…but, you still are taking the risk…because no birth control is 100% effective…..unless you get fixed. We live in a sexually active society. If more women are keeping their babies because they are not looked down on by society anymore. More couples live together today than get married.

It is sad that what you morally disagree with you don't have the guts to stand up for.   I can say the same about you. What you are positing here are feeble challenges. So feeble, in fact, I wonder if your heart is even in this debate.

"Firstly, just because abortion was illegal up until the early 70s does not mean women weren't having it done. It's an archaic procedure - the earliest recorded abortion was in Egypt, 1550 BCE. And they'll continue to do it in the future. You just need to get over it. Secondly, you can be both. You can believe in abortion under the right circumstances.    ""It makes no difference to the child whether the mother was raped. So the rape is one violent act... and abortion is the next.""   Could you be anymore heartless? The mother never  asked  to be victimized, so if she chooses abortion, it's more of an act she was  forced  into, not one she decided upon of her own volition. Why wouldn't you call the man who raped her a murderer, in essence? And let's consider for a moment the victim decided to keep her child - what do you think she may one day tell him/her when they continually ask where their father is? ""Honey, you were a mistake and your father brutally raped me in a dark alley somewhere?"" Yeah, kudos for Father of the Year! In this case, he would have victimized  two  people instead of just one.   ""No birth control is 100% effective... unless you get fixed.""   Are you honestly suggesting people  not  have sex from fear they might get pregnant? Go shout that in the town square, see how many agree. I agree, people should practice safe sex, but if they take all necessary precautions and get pregnant anyway, and decided for whatever reason the time isn't right, they're entitled to an abortion.

"Depends on how far along the child is, if the pregnancy is not past the first trimester then no it is not taking a life.   For it has nothing to be innocent of, it has not yet lived to experience things that would make it innocent or guilty which are both conscious thought processes that a baby does not possess especially as a fetus.   A fetus is a parasite, living off of the host until the pregnancy has been full filled and the baby has been birthed. Only then would it be the taking of an innocent life.

"of course not!! let me define the ""real"" abortion...  Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo.....  so... we just ""remove"" something unnecessary (well, although it will be a human nine months later..)   and then the word that we should discuss from this motion is ""life""...  and embryo is not yet become a human which have a life...  embryo, still a part of pregnant woman , which synchronize by ""placenta"".... when we do abortion, we just remove that part..

Your just an idiotic athiest who doesnt even know what he's talking about.     Have you ever read the bible? The biblical god has smote children on more than one occasion. The common examples are the flood (children were among those to be drowned), and the first-born of Egypt (as if a first-born child has any idea of what's going on at that age, and deserves death). Then there are battles in which the god-approved side was given the approval (blessing) to kill everyone in the opposing side, including sacking their cities, and their women and children. Also, do not forget that a kid who is disrespectful towards his or her parents is to be put to death.

Jesus approves of the old testament, it's just that the writings are so brutal even you, a supposedly faithful servant, cannot bear to live so uncivilised.  Matthew 5:17-19 (King James Version)   17Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.   18For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.   19Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  Until the second coming, the final judgement, the law of the old testament is to be upheld.

Why shouldn't I read the text literally? Because it doesn't give you answer you like? Christians are very strange this way, whenever you read the bible in a way that doesn't put your hindsight into it, or gives an answer that doesn't seem favourable, they say something like ""you're reading it literally"" but when you discuss science, or medicine, or politics, the same Christians will go right ahead ans say ""science is wrong!!! because it literally says the earth was made in six days.""  Try being consistent. If you want everything to be metaphorical, then stop saying that the earth is six thousand years old, that science is wrong, etc. If you want everything to be literal, then accept that the old testament still applies.

Judges 11:30-40 (King James Version)    30And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,   31Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.   32So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.   33And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.   34And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.   35And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.   36And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.   37And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.   38And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.   39And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,   40That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.   2 Kings 2:23-24 (King James Version)    23And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.   24And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.   1 Samuel 15:2-3 (King James Version)    2Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.   3Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

Extra-biblical information is therefore unnecessary, unless you're adding more biblical sources. When you debate science, or non-biblical topics, THEN you provide proof, logic, evidence, etc. When you're debating a specific mythology, you have to hold to that mythology as the final authority.  I've read that site before, they usually change the topic or frame the question away from what was asked and then answer that. They are also superfluous, because the subject was abortion, then ""god doesn't disapprove of killing children or babies"" with the corresponding scripture. It says right there in black and white, in the KJV scripture I provided that god has no issues with killing children or unborn offspring. What they have to say on the matter isn't important, because they have authority that is below the bible.

"The only time an abortion is allowed is when the continuation of the pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk! Otherwise, under whatever circumstances, abortion is a crime..   Let me ask you a question. Are you aware of foetal development? The first four weeks after having unprotected sex, there isn't even an embryo yet. Once you have the embryo it's weeks before it even develops into a foetus, which means it is a few cells with no mind or organs. 50% of abortions happen before the woman even has a foetus inside her. Once it becomes a foetus, it's another 7 to 9 weeks before it even has a heart pumping blood. The brain is still in the process of growing. 40% of abortions happen before this point in foetal development.  You are acting emotionally when you should be detached. This is a rational situation, not an emotional one.   It's a crime against the unborn baby; against the mother - even if she doesn't want the baby(for a further explained reason); against humanity and our morals and most importantly against God.   The unborn baby has no rights at this point. It isn't a person yet. Maybe it bothers you to think of people in a way that allows them at some point to no longer be people. Humanity doesn't suffer from abortions, the only way it could suffer is if abortions were so common that our death rate exceeded our birth rate, but this isn't the case. Morals and god are irrelevant, because those are beliefs and values that belong to you and only you, they aren't exactly shared by the women having abortions so it is a case of you imposing your god and your morals upon someone else against their will.   Even if this pregnancy occurred due to unsafe sex or it was unexpected by a couple, no one has the right to object to what God has created.. If it's because of unsafe sex, when are you going to take responsibility of your own life and live with the consequences of your mistakes?!   The woman is taking responsibility by terminating the pregnancy. In her case it would be irresponsible to have a child that isn't wanted and would grow up lacking the support it needs.   Who, nowadays, is not educated enough to know that somehow unsafe sex can lead to pregnancy?!   Protected sex can lead to pregnancy, depending upon the failure rates of the contraceptives used. Also bear in mind that the religious groups you're supporting by bringing god into this are often against contraception, and spread misinformation about it, such as ""condoms contain holes"" or ""condoms have HIV inside of them."" In this respect they are against the methods that prevent pregnancy and are against the tools that stop pregnancy as well, they seem to want women to function as baby-factories, or live a celibate lifestyle.   In the case where you were ""raped"", then i suggest you get yourself together and talk about what happened to you before it's too late and you'd be more miserable than ever..   And then she has a child who is a reminder of the man who abused her. The child will suffer for this, and that's how you end up with a more dysfunctional society: children neglected by their mothers who wind up on the streets as thieves or gang members.   In the case where the pregnancy is unexpected - or so it's called - why do you think it happened in the first place?! Everything happens for a reason and only God knows why.. so again, who are you to question fate?!   If it's unexpected, it could be that the child will be raised in poverty because the mother can't afford it.   No one has the right to decide the fate of another creature.. NO ONE! but God...   Yet you're here telling pregnant women what their fate should be.

"Dear opponent, let me ask YOU a question.. do you even know how to debate?!  In a PROFESSIONAL debate, you do not attack any opponent but attack the argument.. I suggest you concentrate on attacking the argument instead of attacking the opponent next time..    Don't change the topic.   First of all, i do not follow any religious groups and personally i think that that information about condoms is just ridiculous and built on ignorant opinions..   You identify as Muslim, which is a religious group, and Muslim religious authorities have spread misinformation about scientific issues. The Catholics however are the primary offenders when it comes to issues of birth control misinformation.   Secondly, if i were to follow your ""style"" of debating, I'd say: You are acting irrationally and a person with no beliefs or morals.   Whether or not I have morals or beliefs is not the topic of this debate. You should be more concerned with my statement about imposing your morals and beliefs upon others.   Third of all, exactly as you said, these are my beliefs and morals and as i said only God decides the fate of all mankind, so i am simply sharing my point of view and debating. I am not forcing anything on anyone and every person is free to follow what they believe...   It is often best to not base a position on beliefs but instead form a position from data and evidence, that way you can form an unbiased solution for dealing with the problem at hand. If you take a random handful of people, and ask them how they feel about abortion, they'll give you widely varying starting times for when it is killing an innocent life, ranging from conception to birth. However there is only one true answer, and this is why science is important here.   Yes i am. In the case where a woman practices unsafe sex and does not want a pregnancy to occur, there are certain pharmaceutical drugs that should be taken between 48 - 72 hours after intercourse.. Otherwise, expect anything..   Fertilisation begins 3 weeks after intercourse. About 50% of abortions occur before the zygote becomes an actual foetus, and about 40% occur before the foetus has a developed heart.   Is she really? As i mentioned in an earlier argument, by keeping quiet she is the one allowing herself to go through all this pain.. She may be scared but if she thought of the consequences of keeping quiet - which is a pregnancy maybe - then she should realize keeping quiet isn't the wisest thing to do.. You speak up, you get help and there would be no reason for abortion anyway...   Yes. Getting an abortion is a form of personal responsibility.  Do you have trouble understanding rape? If a woman is raped, the social stigma of being pregnant is less important than the persistent reminder that your child is unwanted, forced upon you by a violent sexual act, and the offspring of the man who did this to you.  This is why using god as a basis of ethics and morality can lead to some very unrealistic solutions to simple problems.

Going to school, planning their future but they were deprived of this which to me is completely immoral.     It doesn't matter what would become of the foetus. We don't defend the rights of something based on a merely possible future outcome. What matters is what the foetus or embryo is today. Anything after that is a single possibility out of an infinity of choices. This is why we don't consider ejaculations or ovulations as life.

I assumed that your reasoning capabilities were faulty.   Now, having gone through the trial of assessing your comprehension of refutation, twice no doubt, I am left wondering why “taking an aspirin” has any relevance to the abortion of a pregnancy and its attributes.   You responded to my argument that abortion isn't taking a life, as a foetus doesn't qualify. You asked if an abortion ends a biological process, presumably because life is a biological process. I replied that aspirin ends a biological process, implying that a biological process is just another name for metabolism, or biological pathways.  In other words, abortion ends a biological process, but life isn't the only biological process.

"Has history not shown that Muslims and Jews approve of murder? Muslims with their Jihadi ways; Jews according to their own history books?

And you may use the plunder the LORD your God gives you from your enemies. 15 This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.   16 However, in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. 17 Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you. 18 Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the LORD your God.  Koran:  Surah 9:5   5Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush.

"I am quite sick of abortion debates, so I'll write my three strongest arguments for abortion and let's see if any of you ""pro-life"" people can rebut them. While many people have formulated different arguments for abortion (some better than others), not all of them are grounded in the concept of  sentience . Unlike them, all of my three arguments do, at least, relate to the concept of sentience.   1. The Sentience Argument   1. Only a being that is conscious and capable of experiencing pleasure and pain can be said to have interests.  2. A sentient, and therefore morally significant, being is one with an interest in continued life.  3. Ergo, only a sentient being can be said to perhaps have a  right  to life. (From (2) )  4. Normal human foetus begins to possess a rudimentary capacity for sentience in the  second  trimester.  5. Ergo, an early term foetus is  NOT  a being with an interest in its own continued life. (From (3) and (4) ) (Or, Only a human foetus from the second trimester on can perhaps be said to have a right to life)  6. Ergo, an early term human foetus (i.e. foetus in the first trimester) does  not  have a right to life (from (5) )  7. Ergo, an early term abortion is morally permissible (from (6) ).   2. The Utilitarian Argument   1. Different sentient beings experience differing degrees or intensities of experiences such as suffering.  2. The prospect of death and dying is a more intense experience for a sentient being that possesses capabilities such as foreknowledge, fear, anticipation, and fuller recognition of dangers and of their own interests.  3. Ergo, the principle of respect for the interests of sentient beings does not imply that all sentient beings have an equal right to life. (from (1) and (2) )  4. A foetus, sentient or otherwise, does not possess foreknowledge, fear, anticipation, and fuller recognition of dangers and of their own interests.  5. Ergo, a sentient foetus may be accorded lesser moral significance than the sentient adult human being in whose body it gestates. (from (3) and (4) )  6. Ergo, the suffering experienced by a sentient late term foetus terminated through abortion, would be less than the suffering experienced by the pregnant woman, a sentient being, were she forced to continue with the pregnancy. (from (1), (2) and (4) )  7. Ergo, a sentient pregnant woman has a greater right to life than a (sentient) foetus. (from (3) and (6) )  8. Ergo, a late term abortion is morally permissible (from (7) )   3. The Personhood Argument   1. Personhood is defined in terms of the possession of characteristics and capacities such as consciousness, ability to reason, self-motivated activity, communication, and possession of a concept of the self.  2. It is more seriously morally impermissible to kill a person than a non-person, even a sentient non-person.  3. An early-stage foetus possesses little, if anything, in the way of consciousness, self-conceptualisation, reasoning and communication abilities.  4. Ergo, focuses are not persons (from (1) and (3) )  5. Ergo, foetuses cannot possess interests or rights, including the right to life (from (4) )  6. Ergo, it is not morally impermissible to kill them (from (5) ).  You might have noticed that in all three of my arguments, my conclusions are not necessarily the same. I am  not  advocating for a convergence in conclusion when I posit these arguments. I am merely stating three (quite) good arguments for abortion.

Abortion is over very quickly indeed, and completely painless in the first trimester and a month and a bit after.

Had I been aborted, I would have been spared the agony of dealing with hypocrites--the most prevalent and destructive types the human race has ever known.

"What about an ectopic pregnancy? It happens when an egg is fertilised whilst still in a fallopian tube, and if left unaborted, will rupture the woman's internal organs, and kill the mother and the child.

"With so many excruciatingly painful situations throughout the world that need our immediate attentions, abortion is so far down the list as not to be anything for me to consider.

However, even in such cases, under certain circumstances and in timely fashion, such a law would be made circumventable.  I would suggest that we spend more time, effort, and resources looking after those humans we already have on board.

"1. The defining characteristic of a person is sapience. You need thought. You need self awareness. And to get those things you need a functioning brain. Since there is no coherent brain activity in early fetal development until AT LEAST 22 weeks we are most certainly not dealing with anything we could meaingfully call a person prior to that time. And since something like 97% of all abortions occur in that window and any occuring after it are almost always for reasons of medical necessity that alone should end this discussion.  2. EVEN IF we insisted on calling a fetus a person before then. Hell, even if we called it a person from the second it was conceived even though calling a few undifferentiated cells a ""person"" is insane... that still wouldn't be an arument for outlawing abortion since that requires declaring that the mother has no legal right to control over her own body. That it is superceded by another ""person's"" right to use her body for their own preservation. That is not a right that exists in our society. That right is possessed by NOBODY, and for good reason. I sure as hell cannot commandeer your body against your will to preseve my life. Nobody can walk up to you and force you to have surgery to give up a peice of your liver or some bone marrow because I need it to survive and my ""right to life"" trumps your right to have final say on what happens to your body.   If we do that we define people as community property. Which is what outlawing abortion based on arguments that the mother   doesnt have the right to say   if her body gets used to carry a child to term would be doing. It's despicable.  There is no justification fr outlawing abortion. Regulating it, yes. Placing reaosnable restrictions on late-term occurances, yes. Outlawing? Absolutely not. It must be legal.

"1. It's not a person. Abortion to me is no different than jizzing in a rag, sure there is potential that those cells could have made a person, but they aren't now and that they never will shouldn't bother anyone in the least.  2. Given that there is 0 proof that the cluster of cells has any type of self-awareness, a preponderance of proof that the cluster of cells  doesn't  have self-awareness, then it is the case of a person doing something to their own body. People should be allowed to do whatever they like with there own body.   3. Even if abortion were illegal, there is evidence that illegality has never stopped women from getting an abortion if they want one. Making it illegal would  not  save these imaginary people anyway, but it would kill scores of women who decide to get an abortion in a dirty basement instead of a clean hospital.

Why would you impose upon women the inability to remove foetuses that aren't individuals?

Think about that for a moment. Everything that makes us what we are comes from our brain, but what's aborted in the vast majority of cases has NO brain. In many cases what's aborted is a microscopic bit of cells. This isn't the same as killing infants or babies, so you need to learn more about it and divorce yourself from that mindset.

Emotional pleas can be used but they should never serve as the core of your position, because emotional pleas are subjective and go the way the wind blows. Even in a theological debate, one must back their position with orthodox texts.  I am a strictly rational individual, and what you said to me by invoking god is that you have a belief but cannot support it with evidence or reason.

"And your taxes wont  link   Not even mentioning that abortion isn't murder,  I see a pattern of you often being misinformed.  Currently most insurance companies cover reproductive services, chances are the insurance you have now either through your parents or employer provides reproductive services that includes abortion. But it isn't taken from your taxes, you or your parents or your employer is  now  paying for abortions.  The new laws are the same thing it looks like. Women can choose to get reproductive services, the money is pooled as is the case with all insurance, and that may be one of the services covered. However, it is only covered if one pays into the system - they are paying for it.  It's the status quo, and the abortion subject was only brought up to rile up the misinformed. What Republicans and some Democrats  tried  to slip into the new legislation was basically a ban on all abortion. They tried to use the bill as an excuse to make it harder for poor people to get abortions. That's all it was.  The fact remains though, that even if that were to happen, if they were able to make it harder for poor people to get abortions, it just means women getting the procedure in other ways that are often dangerous. Never in history has making abortion illegal, or even more expensive, stopped abortion.  You should be happy though. Now you get to stay on your parent's plan for a few more years if you are in a situation where you do not have an employer who provides insurance.  And if your child goes to college someday, they will be able to stay on your policy while in school all the way till age 27 I believe... maybe 26.  On top of that, it will be less expensive as soon as the millions of self-employed who aren't sick but still can't afford a private plan will be paying into the system.  Unless you're single with no kids and make over 100k a year, or have kids and two incomes and make over 200k a year, you are getting a great deal with this bill.

"“It moves and has to be provided with nourishment and protection from the mothers womb. So it is not human? How is it not living?”  Anyone who bluntly says an unborn child is a living thing is missing the concept. People need a wider understanding of this topic as it is of huge philosophical importance. Does an unborn baby have self-awareness/sapience/soul/spirit/ intellect/free-thought?    If not, abortion is no crime  “I think every woman and anyone that's for abortions, that has a voluntary abortion should have every reproduction organ removed from their body . My Aunt cannot have children and she wants one more than anything and some women are throwing them away like they were the fetus's are trash.”  Quite a harsh statement. Seeing as the main people who need abortions are teen mothers. These people are far-worse off than any person not capable of mothering children. I am guessing your auntie is aged 30-40, middle-class. These teens are pregnant; they get ostracized, have to fight for economic dependence and may soon be forced to limit the growth of their education to take care of a child. This will ultimately lead to very poor living standards for both of them in the future. If she doesn’t get an abortion, two lives are ruined and we have another generation of dysfunctional youths consisting of crack fiends, prostitutes, pimps, gang members and robbers. Low level income will force them to poor strata’s of society.   Don’t give me some inspirational story about how some mum got out of a life of hardship and she and her son are doing fine. That’s not reality for the vast majority. I grew up in a shitty neighborhood and I would like to see the last of these dysfunctional youths off the street, back in school and focusing on their career. However we can’t just make it happen, first we have to make sure there is not going to be more of them in the future.   “Why won't they just have the baby and give it to someone like my aunt.”  I agree.

Your stating the following:   If something is not a human person, even if it is a human being then it is allowable for it to be killed.   The human person argument has problems, in that more then a fetus can be argued to lack personhood.  are you a human person after birth but before lets say you can crawl? are you a human person if your condition is one of severe down-syndrome? are you a human person if your in a coma. are you a human person when your asleep?

"Pros of Abortion   Many a times, abortion helps to safeguard women's health. There are many women, who suffer from various hazardous medical conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia, severe diabetes, etc. As these diseases can be life-threatening, an abortion often helps to avoid serious medical complications from childbirth. But abortion should be carried out after proper medical advice as it can lead to potential miscarriages in the future.

"When does life start? That is the question. This debate will be over in a matter of minutes if someone came up with the answer right now.  Evangelists would believe it starts at contraception while scientists debate that it is more accurately the development of the brain which is the seventh week of development.   Of course any right minded person wouldn't put the science of birth in the hands of someone with no scientific expertise so it is generally accepted that the 7th is the week that a clump of cells turn into human.  However how can any scientist or evangelist understand when a child gains a soul as the question is purely philosophical?  The soul has been deemed integral or essential to consciousness, personality and every free thinking person has a soul which defines his existence as a human being rather than an imamate object.   Plato says that a soul is a combination of various aspects. Mind, reason, emotion, appetite and desire. These characteristics define a soul. According to Platoan philosophy, if you were void of one of these aspects you are without soul.  -An unborn child has a mind which allows it to make functional processes in its body but is not capable of and thought. Thought encompasses things such as imagination, ideas and reflection. A lot of people say dreams are proof of an unborn child’s thought but dreams don’t count because they are instinctive of a human slumber. It forces the brain to stay asleep as an inactive brain causes your brain to disable processing information from nervous system and other systems. This could ultimately cause you to loose consciousness all together so an automatic reaction is to wake up, it’s like a screensaver.   -An unborn child has no reason; it has no choices to create over itself. No study has shown that an unborn child has ever been able to conduct its own decisions rather than its own instinctive actions.  -It has no emotion, no joy, sadness or pity. (For all your religious nuts out there, pain is not an emotion)  -Appetite is only created through its instinct to survive, I suppose it counts.  -Unborn children have no desire. They do not want anything but their instinct to, live, eat, and kick stomach every now and then. There is no aspiration or defining motive.   If anyone has any counters against these points I would like to hear what you have to say. However I do believe this is an erudite explanation of the creation of ones consciousness from a philosophical standpoint. When an unborn child gains all these aspects it moves from inanimate object to living, breathing, free-thinking human being.   Ty.

"Should not the philosophy behind laws and Laws themselves be consistent? If abortion is justified by the lack of sapience. Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies, killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth, even during a temporary period like sleep? after all you will eventually demonstrate sapience when you wake up, which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience. well sleeping your moments are similar to the kicking a fetus may have, they are not a demonstration of sapience. The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience. If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems. Sapience is not always active, consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything?    If someone came to me and needed one of my organs. I would not be the cause of them needing my organ. I would not be liable for their situation. A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation. She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it. combine that with the complications above and this seem to be quite muddled. So the question seems to me to be more of weather our laws and philosophies behind them should be consistent and if they are not then it is not principles but rather utility they are based on.

It is ok to wear a condom. any such person being stopped from existing is just hypothetical. A fetus isnt a person, it is a human being. however just what the hell is a person? abortion gets down to questions that have been disputed for hundreds of years, and to this day don't possess satisfactory answers.   A fetus is undeniably alive by the way, it just doesn't demonstrate sapience and can not. Expanding the scope of the argument leads to problems, showing that the argument from sapience is only valid with ""but"", ""ifs"" etc which would contradict the argument. Is a baby born less then one day ago really sapient? if not, why not be able to put it in a dumpster. It does not have a choice of its own, and does not seem very ""person"" like. Thus it fits the criteria and people should have the ability to kill it, for it is very dependent on a care taker(s) and what right does it have to impose on anyone?

Then could not the same argument be used to justify such things as dumpster babies, killing of severally mentally disabled people, people in a coma or any one who doesn't demonstrate sapience after birth, even during a temporary period like sleep?   Dumpster babies have a level of self-awareness, as noted by their ability to respond to stimuli, that they have a nervous system, and that they have a memory. Sleeping babies are the same.  I personally approve of euthanasia for the severely mentally handicapped, and people who are in comas long enough that their recovery is nonexistent. Provided that the mentally handicapped are violent, and/or completely unable to function.  But this is all besides the point: laws are never consistent in their philosophy.   which would be the same argument given stating that a fetus will eventually develop a brain and demonstrate sapience   We don't base laws on the potential future ramifications of a choice. This is why disposing of a used condom isn't considered abortion, for example.   The exact definition of sapience is interestingly not needed to show that a fetus doesn't have it. it simply needs to be shown that sapience requires a well enough developed brain and that a fetus lacks a developed enough one and thus lacks sapience no matter what is to be said of further defining of the concept of sapience. If the same criteria is applied towards organisms with developed brains then there are problems. Sapience is not always active, consciousness shuts down, comes in various degrees etc do these problems not amount to anything?   This is because sapience comes from the brain. If a foetus has none, it cannot be sapient. Sapience in this discussion is an umbrella word for independent thought, some level of consciousness, an ability to make decisions and so on.  We don't apply it to organisms with developed brains because those organisms are already capable of individuality. At this point, losing consciousness doesn't disqualify the individuality, unless the organism has transitioned into a state where they can not recover their consciousness, such as in a coma.   If someone came to me and needed one of my organs. I would not be the cause of them needing my organ. I would not be liable for their situation. A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation. She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it.   This is why abortion is made available. In those cases where a woman becomes pregnant, she can abort before the foetus is even a person, before it has a brain. By illegalising abortion, you remove a woman's right to abort the process that creates a human life, you force her to either have an illegal abortion, or to accept that pregnancy automatically leads to a human being born.   In such a case we should just say we allow abortion because it suits us, not that it is allowed because of some philosophical system or principled decision.   The laws allowing abortion do so because it suits the women. They don't parade themselves as some sort of philosophical and moral beacon. It's mostly pragmatic.

The texting and driving laws are about the future ramifications of allowing or not allowing different groups(age based) to text and drive. The question asked is the following: Will banning it decrease crashes? the word ""will"" is a reference to the future.    You're mistaking laws which exist to prevent accidents, using statistics to back their premises, with a law which would make an operation illegal because the present life it ends would in the future be a life.  In other words, the first types of laws are about minimising the chance of damage. Chance is the operative word. The second hypothetical law is about preventing an operating from occurring because only in the future will it have ethical problems. The distinguishing feature is that one set of laws is based on chance accident prevention, the other is based upon the rights bestowed to a person only in a hypothetical future, in other words treating a present nonentity as a future person.  Going back to my condom example, the example was reducing your argument to its extremes. A condom has sperm which if allowed to fertilise an egg will become a foetus, then a child. Wasting the condom therefore would be the same as wasting a child's life, using your reasoning.   what is meant by individuality? the zygote has its own dna pattern. it is individual, unique. I have a feeling you mean something different?   Individuality comes from the memories you have. Clones exist as part of nature, but they are still separate individuals because they experience different memories.   the first two weeks of pregnancy your not actually pregnant according to the first article mentioned in the above, there is most certainly nothing wrong with doing something with in that time period to insure you don't become pregnant.    I would argue that since we are already dealing with a known individual, the woman, who already has legal rights bestowed upon her as an individual, the decision of whose rights should prevail is fairly simple. It hasn't been established even remotely that the foetuses which are aborted in over 90% of cases are individuals.

"Ok, this is my criticism of the argument for abortion from sapience:   The argument for abortion from sapience is a valid logical argument known as Barbra(or if your picky you can called it a variation of that argument) and is as follows  1.All non-(Human persons) are beings which do not have rights.  2.All fetuses are non-(human persons).  --------------------------------------- -------------------------   3.Therefore all fetuses are beings which do not have rights.   This is indeed Barbara (and a disjunctive syllogism):   1.All A are B  2.All C are A  --------------------------------------- --------------------------   3.All C are B  The soundness of this argument is completely dependent on the category of non-(human persons) which is dependent on the category of person.    This category is ill defined to start with but there are a few things that seems to be commonly agreed on:   1.A human person is a human being   2.A human person is a human being with the quality of personhood.   This forces us to look into personhood, so lets look into it:  1.Personhood is dependent on the brain,   A. How developed of a brain?    I. How is this decision decided or development measured? Likely by what functions the brain can accomplish, then the importance of those functions would have to be supported.   II. If the functions of the brain is what decides how developed of a brain then there is two options of approach which are as follows:   AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.   BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?  In less cases but in some the brains capability of some brain functions changes in the same way as the ability to demonstrate brain functions do.   Most brain functions change with time. If we base rights on most brain functions then the existence of any rights at all would be much much more volatile them they actually are.  Keeping all that in mind it seems clear that a human being also being a “human person” from birth to death is hypothetical, that human beings stop and start being “human persons” at times and still retain their rights. Also human beings which lack basic brain functions, such as babies( object permanence, for example. which many animals possess), possess rights. Thus the argument from sapience is unsound. Premise one is not true.  The truth value of premise two depends on the definition of personhood. The definition of personhood is arbitrary for it depends on a arbitrary selection of brain functions which are themselves usually ill defined and heavily dependent on subjective interpretation. thus you might as well make a reference to absurdity and say abortion is allowed simply because people say it is, no reason to give . This is because the argument from sapience is equivalent to doing such.  Jean piaget(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Jean_Piaget)  tells us that human beings don't begin to think logically about events and ideas till approximately age 7. We lack a sense of object permanence till around age 2. We also lack the ability to tell that if a object is stretch so that when its skinny there is not less of the object compared to how much was there when it was wider in-till we reach a later age. It would be difficult to consider anyone a “human person” with out the last 2 abilities.  Also i must mention, fetuses are simply human. There is no such thing as sub-human. The idea of sub-human is a horrible one. It suggests a hierarchy of organisms with humanity at the top, and because of humanities “superiority”(superiority according to what standard?) they are allowed the ability to do what would otherwise be dis-moral(which seems like a non-sequitur to me).

"Alright, I thought I'd throw this into the discussion (a logic bomb?), based upon my research I've ascertained that the majority of abortions don't even fall into the argument from sapience.   http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html    http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/                                       facts/after_12_weeks.html    Name your source, they both agree that the majority of abortions occur before week twelve (88% to 89% according to each).   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ commons/thumb/5/57/ Prenatal_development_table.svg/ 1000px- Prenatal_development_table.svg.png    This handy guide shows us that foetal development just barely starts between weeks 10-12.  According to wikipedia, the nervous system begins development around week ten.  So, from all this information, I would make the argument that we can reasonably infer that the majority of abortions involve embryos and foetuses which are either incapable of awareness (no brain) or have such a rudimentary system with no inputs that they can't be aware. In this case I think the remaining 11% to 12% of abortions begin to enter into the argument from sapience which you deconstructed.  I applaud you for a well-reasoned argument, but I had some ideas which weren't considered:   #1   Suppose we start with a reasonable premise that a foetus under 20 weeks of development is less sapient than the mother.  Suppose we accept the definition of personhood where a born person is a person (as you explained cogently, the definition of a person is quite flexible and arbitrary, at least in a legal sense).  In this case, one could argue that abortion for foetuses under twenty weeks is a matter of granting the mother, who has greater capacity for individuality, thought, and so-forth, right over her own body over something which is severely limited in this capacity and isn't yet granted the ""benefit of the doubt"" which the title of personhood confers.   #2   Suppose we impart the commonly accepted notion of ""dead"" where having a heartbeat qualifies you as being alive into the argument from sapience.  In this case, all foetuses under nineteen weeks old are abortable because the heart doesn't even begin beating until approximately week nineteen. It's reasonable to assume that a being without a functioning heart in this capacity cannot be aware or thinking because these processes require a large amount of energy which is supplied by blood.   #3   Suppose we conduct tests upon developing foetuses' and babies' brains which shows us once and for all that a foetus doesn't become a ""baby"" until say, week X (where X is some high week, like between 30 and 36).  In this case, the argument from sapience plus knowledge from science would give us a more strict window of when a foetus should be rationally protected from abortion.   #4   This is basically an extended version of #1, but using practicality as a measure alongside sapience, and with high priority.  Suppose we consider the mother's rights as a person to be of paramount importance. These include a right over her body.  In this case, it follows that a less developed foetus' life is considered less valuable than the right of a woman to have full control over her reproductive system, even if it means that around 1% of abortions will end the lives of highly developed foetuses. We consider their sapience to be less than the woman's and a sacrifice until a better solution emerges which satisfies the woman's rights in addition to enabling the foetus to live.  I'd like to address some of what you said:    AA. The brain needs to demonstrate these functions:  A lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated, and some will be timed based for even adults. Thus personhood, and rights become transient. Rights disappear before death, and depending on what functions also disappear daily. Rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death.  BB. The brain needs to be capable of these functions. Arguably this is the same criteria as 1.II.AA. Since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it. Capability has two meanings: the statistical probability of something happening being high, which is the same as hypothetical ability Or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen, also hypothetical(Bad definition I know, but it should be clear and also a important input is time). What is this something with variable inputs? Is it a brain, the process of brain development, both? Why one over the other options?   I believe that the best answer one can give to your question concerning when a brain has abilities selected by society to make the person eligible for personhood and whether those rights disappear when the functions cease, is that in our society there is a tendency to grant a benefit until exception. In other words, under such a proposed society where personhood is granted based on the brain meeting qualifiers, that personhood would continue being granted until aberrant behaviour warrants a retest, and that test reveals something to be lost. Similar to how a drivers license is granted after some conditions are met, and revoked after you are caught driving drunk for example, not when you happen to drive after drinking a beer (which technically might disqualify you, but police don't keep instantaneous tabs on everyone).

"so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?  I decided to make up names/categories because i don't know already established names for these concepts. they are defined as they come up, feel free to suggest alternative names.  If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.   However because rights are awarded to human beings which lack even basic brain functions and that it would be very difficult to define personhood in such a way to non-arbitarily include only human-beings in pre-birth periods of development as having non-person-hood then AFS might as well be considered unsound and thus inconclusive on weather fetuses have rights.    Another argument whose conclusion is the following: That all human beings which lack a brain/braintissue also lack rights (lets call it Argument from um... biology? AFB) would have nothing to say on any human beings with a brain or with any brain tissue. AFB would be sound from my first analysis of it. . another argument stating that there is a certain amount of brain development required would have something to say on all human beings which do not reach the period of development(Lets call this argument the up-till-a-point argument or UPA).  your #2 is a very good insight for It would be very beneficial to distinguish between parts of the brain which give rise to consciousness, awareness, etc(C-functions) and which just simply pump the heart, work the lungs, etc(H-functions). If it can be shown that H-functions are the only functions present till a certain point then that point would be a very good point to use for the UPA argument.   all three of the above arguments come in the form of Barbara.( I forgot to put a 'a' in-between the 'b' and 'r' in my last post.) thus if someone disagreed with them they would have to attack their premises.   I like how you pick your sources, very good.  I like number 3. I think science needs to be used more in legal matters. It too often seems like politicians yelling at each other and not backing themselves up by empirical methods.  a sort summery of my criticism on the AFS is that some brain functions, like awareness disappear nightly. sleeping would constitute aberrant behavior of awareness; however it reappears when one awakes. If a certain level of awareness must be demonstrated for a human being to be a person then person-hood is lost nightly along with rights since AFS considers them dependent on person-hood.This is not the case in actuality, people maintain rights despite sleeping. If awareness must be within a statistical likelihood of occurring within a certain amount of time, aka capable; then those constraints would be arbitrary and why they are chosen would need to be shown superior to other constraints like a longer period of time(9 months) or such in order to be more acceptable then a similar argument with different constants(a fetus being a hypothetical person and thus deserving of rights for example, similar because a sleeping human-being would also constitute a hypothetical person) . awareness also seems like one of those things which would have to be included in person-hood, in order for it to have much value.

"""""Life"" please specify what you mean by the word ""life"".   Sorry what I was referring to was sapience  ""Souls as supernatural things do not exist, or if you would prefer the less strong statement are not falsifiable or observable.""  What I am trying to get across is that soul is a concept. It’s symbolic of sapience. The concept of soul is key to the philosophical and religious debate about unborn children.   ""Free will does not exist, it is non-sensical and thus to say a unborn child has never conducted its own decisions only instinctive actions is to say it has done only what any of us can do.""  I was not talking about free will; I am talking about free thought. Free will is the decision to create your own perspective. Free thought defines ones ability to influence its own mindset, create decisions that are not based on instinctual behaviour.   That argument just goes out the window because I did not once mention free-will which is a different concept. The exact phrase I used was “free thinking”.   I feel as if you’re dancing around the concept a bit. I said an unborn baby can’t make any decisions at all, it is completely imamate. Just like a rock, a twig, a leaf, they make no decisions and are only influenced by nature. Yet you’re carrying on about our own free-will.  Yes free-will in the form we know it is an illusion. Our world is only moving in one direction and there is hardly any relativity. However you defeat yourself by saying that statement at all, you deny your own spiritual existence. If you had no free will you would not have wrote that sentence in the first place.   Free-will has no black and white definition. Because if free-will existed I would to be able to do whatever I wanted when I wanted with no consequences but I am restricted to living the life I was giving because of the circumstances of this world. However what you must understand is that free-will is the foundation of our sapience. Without it we are inanimate beings. A mere shell with no occupant.   Most people against abortion are religious fanatics which is why this kind of discussion is appropriate. But you clearly are not. What are you? Are you pro-choice or pro-life or what. It feels like you are dancing between the two.  You made a discussion about sapience and then made a double standard about me not having proof of the existence of a soul?  Also you should debunk my other statements before falsifying my entire arguments in a few short paragraphs.

"so would a correct summary of what your saying be that when two beings have a claim to one of themselves that the one demonstrating the highest level of awareness should have complete control over the situation?   Yes, in the case that the lower-awareness individual cannot speak, or even comprehend their rights, for example. I suppose I should have added the qualifier that when the difference between awareness is so great that one of the individuals cannot even understand their situation, it seems reasonable to give custody of the body to the other who can.   If a argument is unsound then it doesn't support its conclusion. I would say that the Argument from Sapience(Lets call it AFS) has with in its scope all abortions.    It has all within its scope which care about foetal awareness. Some arguments are purely rights based, and see the mother as executive over her body.  With regards to AFS, I think the primary way it can be used without being seen as arbitrary is that if we find that a foetus isn't developed enough to be aware of its environment, then it isn't perceived as cruel to end its life because it isn't even aware of what it lost. I suppose this can be thought of as a stretch on the saying ""What he doesn't know won't hurt him."" This I believe is also a way to justify euthanasia (such as for deep-coma patients) because it is currently understood that they aren't even aware of their existence. So in other words under these contexts, an AFS isn't an argument for what the person will or may feel in the near future, but instead an argument used to justify a procedure as not being cruel to the recipient presently. Another strain of it arguably appears when we feel consoled when a person dies in their sleep, it is seen as less violent or cruel for that person to die while not aware of it.  An AFB would have the benefit of allowing human clones who are born without brains (beyond what is necessary for autonomic functions I suppose) to exist rationally to serve as organ hosts.  The UPA argument is the hardest to defend because as we both saw, it relies on a very grey boundary of what we feel is ""too soon"" or ""too late."" Science will be our best friend here, but we must always remember how life is rarely divided into discreet units that are easily divided.

"It seems we may of been arguing definitions  Free thinking and free will are synonyms to me; as is perspective and mindset. mindset can be seen as a perspective with a positive feedback loop.  The mind is a beautiful thing full of feedback loops and self modifying. It is bounded by its original state and its environment. If all one starts with in life is instinctual behavior then there is a chain of reaction in all their ""decisions"" which amount to them being based on instinctual behavior. I can write some javascript code which is selfmodifying in such a way which changes how it modifys itself based off of previous modifcations. The exact way to do this would take some time though. currently i'm working on a automatic logical analysis of statements to access their validity; which means i'm looking at their structure and seeing if there are any possible ways the premises could all be true and the conclusion false. I won't have much time to work on either one till summer though which is a roughly a month away. a self-modifying function which changes how it modifies based on previous modifications sounds like a challenge but i know its possible for programs have been evolved and not made before in other languages and thats essentially what i would be doing. i might work some on it but it won't be a high priority project. matter of fact i just found this site yesterday and i need to spend less time on it. I'm in love with argumentation, call it my addiction. i went on a tangent back to the different points.  My spiritual existence is only valid under determinism. This may require more explaining but might be best made a separate debate.  consciousness is an emergent property of a electro-chemical machine, it is the same as the polarity of water.   freewill and freethought both suggest that a human being can be a first cause that their decisions are neither random nor determined. A human being is not a god. Although god is an ambiguous word and in one sense i can say that, and in another sense i can say i am my own god. Perhaps god is a word which should be avoided in debate due to its ambiguity.  Abortion constitutes many other debates, it is a debate which rests upon many other debates. I have unique viewpoints upon those debates and i find most other people to be inconsistent when it comes towards abortion, on either side. I'm making a debate to see what the smaller issues are that might be debated best separately.

So I do agree on what you say, ""society be responsible for a females irresponsibility"".  But when it happens, you cant look retrospectivly, you have to look forward. As a teen mother, you cant be given advice such as, ""you should have been more carefull"", when its already happend. So family planning and all that crap can go out the window.  As for financial planning goes, 16-24 years of age for a young woman is the prime age for develpment in educational areas which will one day solidify that persons job stability and stable income. I dont think that their first option should be to suddenly drop everything and take up the cash register at burger king, thats a sure-fire way to ruin two peoples lives! A woman should asspire to greater things in life rather than paying the rest of her life for a mistake which chould have been fixed with one easy pill, injection, baby-killing device or whatever.   I would not liek to see our kind of society (sex crazed maniacs) without abortion. Young teenagers lives in ruins and the detromental affects it will have to the next generation of disfunctional youths. You have to realize what a young child growing up in a fatherless household is like. His/her mother working 12 hour shifts at a fast food outlet just to keep the shanty roof over their heads.

Teen mums, who are left with a baby to take care of and rely on their mums for support, don’t always have a reliable income themselves. We can’t assume every household is economically stable enough fit to take another child into their family.    ""Many of my friends came from backgrounds which should of lead them into being crack-fiends according to you; they are not.”  Yes I grew up in one of these neighborhoods and it looks like your friends were lucky. However we have to look at the community as a whole not a small sample. The social problems with teens start can start with the fatherless household, or the mum always working or the poor living standards. Worst of all these affects are only exacerbated by the poor kind of environment the child will grow up in. There will be crime, alcohol abuse and many others. It may not have affected your friends but you have to realize this is where teen disfunctionality starts and fuels the next generation of crime, prostitution, drug pushers and gang members. I always tend to look at the worst case scenarios rather than the best.  I am happy for you friend for breaking that cycle, however again we cant rely on people to eventually just straighten their lives out, you must realize how lucky your friends are.

"Yes, stop the problem at the root. Un-born children have no rights because at this stage they have no self-awareness in the slightest. No spiritual existence. Remember, if it has no sapience we can't classify it as a regular, normal human being so it cannot qualify for the default human rights.   If 90% of abortions are made before brain tissue is even created, no need to worry about the ethics of it at all. This stage is merely miniscule life-forms.   This argument proves it is even reasonable to abort your unborn (1-6 week) child if you plainly don’t want superficial scarring (previously an un-heard of reason).   ""So are you making an argument that it is better to not live then live a certain kind of life?""  I am saying that a fetus which is alive by definition will die by choice of another human being and be morally sound all the same because it has no sapience attached to it.

Promiscuous: characterized by or involving indiscriminate mingling or association, esp. having sexual relations with a number of partners on a casual basis.   If your teachers say you should love the person you’re sleeping with then they are discouraging promiscuity...........  ""People should learn from their mistakes.""  Mate I totally agree with you on that one but what I was saying before was that society won’t help our teen parents with that kind of attitude. They should be supporting them instead.   ""Doesn’t actually deter me from crime and would surely ruin my life in the long run as getting a job""  Obviously you can’t deter someone from a crime they have already committed... It is clear that a teenager finding out she is pregnant is the most devastating news; it is life changing. I highly doubt she would go off and do it again, not till she is ready.

"Has teenage sex been rising or falling since sex education has been introduced?  Yes, there are tons of other reasons for this correlation. Sex is everywhere. Should it be in schools too? Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex? If you're going to start teaching them atleast do it once they're legally allowed to have sex. Maybe sex education could lead to a decrease in sexual activity - but with a conservative, not a liberal attitude.   I highly doubt she would go off and do it again, not till she is ready.   You're wrong. They do it again all the time.  Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays (that's not including rape). Because of the attitude that it's ok to have sex aslong as you 'love' them. But we all know that until the age of atleast 19 (and that's still young) nobody understands love. In the end the messege leads to - have sex with the person you're with, not the person you 'love'.  Look what happened when kids were kept in the dark. They didn't have tons of underage sex. Maybe that's because it was different times and there weren't tits in their face every other second. But atleast if you're going to teach them about it - teach them that it's wrong to have sex until after you're 16/18/21 or w/e.

"That statistic is purely falsified and slanted to fit your point. Yes sex has been on the rise and you blame sex ed? Sex ed was a response to the teen sex rising! You fail to introduce the hundreds of factors that have increase teen sexual behavior.  Allow me to demonstrate a few:  -Increased alcohol abuse   -Christian faith declines, abstinence declines  -Woman gain more rights  -Television idealizes sex  -Society evolves to accept the sex taboo  -Increased drug abuse  -Corporations exploit sexual images  Just to name a few. And you blame SEXUAL EDUCATION?!  The very concept enforced to reduce the outbreak of HIV, teen pregnancy and COUNTLESS STI's and STD's?????  ""Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?""  People I know had sex when they were 13, if they had it any later it would have been too late. Guess what? They used a condom! Now I can guarantee you, the neighborhood I grew up in, they would have had sex at such a young age nonetheless of sexual education. But this example proves that sexual education benefited people in the community. This is the entire point of sex-ed, to educate.  ""You're wrong. They do it again all the time.""  Gratz, you have nothing to prove that statement.   ""Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays"" ""...that's not including rape).""   There have been 13 cases of ten-year-olds and under giving birth. All of them were rape victims....  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_youngest_birth_mothers    ""attitude that it's ok to have sex aslong as you 'love' them... In the end the messege leads to - have sex with the person you're with, not the person you 'love'""  Again, I said this before; emotions and sex are purely left for parents. This statement proves no thesis of yours. Sex is not based on emotions on any scale. It is purely hormone based. When you’re in love you still need your hormones for libido. You think animals need love when they have sex? If it is purely natural, you can’t defy the laws of nature.   So tell me, when it is ok to have sex??  ""Look what happened when kids were kept in the dark. They didn't have tons of underage sex.""  Firstly, my explanation will serve you better knowing how old you are. I can only assume your maybe under 16 because you have a very repressed view on sex.   So if you’re just a teenager (presumptuously), you would feel perfectly comfortable knowing nothing about sex? It would feel right to understand nothing about what is happening to your body? Then you think about a girl in a naughty way then - oops, what was that? You try and hide your dirty thoughts, thinking that your mind is impure. You carry on this way for the rest of your life. These symptoms have a diagnosis. It’s known as sexual repression. Let me tell you, it is far from uncommon and is a horrible affliction to ones life.   Can I tell you about a group of people who suffered from sexual repression? They grew up with celibacy as their answer. They only thought pure thoughts and repressed all urges. As a result, confused as they were, this group sodomized and indecently assaulted 100 thousand + underage children. These were the priests, the bishops and the pastors. This has been going on long before sexual freedom.   “But at least if you're going to teach them about it - teach them that it's wrong to have sex until after you're 16/18/21 or w/e.”  Maybe ‘you’ (the mystical and know-everything teacher) can explain to these kids as to why sex before that age is ‘wrong’ when it clearly is not and especially when it is exercised under the influence of sexual-education and with the help of condoms.   Perhaps you would like to argue why condoms are ‘wrong’ to solidify your statement ;)

"Wow. You actually hit the nail on the spot for the reasons for increased teen sexual behaviour. But let me make it clear (again). I don't blame sexual education. It's one of the reasons.  I think we only disagree on the concept of sex education. Or our experiences of it anyway.  It is good to be taught to practice safe sex. It is good to learn about the dangers/consequences of sex. But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex, they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.  Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The messege was have sex - but make it safe. Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe. The problem is the liberal attitude. Liberal sex education = bad. That's my point.  P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D

"If you were not taught how to put a condom on, in any years of high schooling, then one of your teachers are applicable to be the victim of a law-suit. If you performed sexual activity with your spouse and got her pregnant, you could make allot of money from one of teachers.   Learning how to put a condom is the entire essence of reducing teen pregnancy and STD's. If safe-sex is performed by teenagers, then it is a non-contributing factor to pregnancy.    "" But being TAUGHT isn't enough, because as clear as daylight - it doesn't help. Young teenagers are having underage sex; they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate. I don't know about you... but to me it's wrong.""   Well... yes, it does help. You make the basis of this argument with the fact that teenagers are still engrossed in having sex, but what you fail to realize is that education has taught them how to enact safe-sexual procedures decreasing there chance of becoming pregnant. No one argues about teen sexual activity as it is irrelevant if they are doing under the influence of protection.    ""they are catching diseases, getting pregnant at an increased rate.""   How about you show me data, telling me, kids who have been taught about sex-ed, are still not performing safe-sex at an un-desirable rate. Also take into account private schools only have optional sexual-education and the majority of private schools are religious schools who only teach of abstinence. Even if the figure shows that only 40% of kids are using condoms due to sex-ed classes, then that is still an incredible result.      ""Sex was literally brought into our lives earlier than it would have been. The message was have sex - but make it safe.""   You do not understand the principles of our society. You think that if kids grew up without sex-ed in their earlier years, they would be having less sex? Sex is cultural and kids are going to do it anyway, so we have to teach them how to have sex-properly with the use of a condom to make sure they do not contribute to the rise of pregnancy.   Also I distinctly remember never being encouraged to have sex in the first place, I don’t know what you are talking about.    ""Not don't have sex (until you're old/mature enough) and make it safe.""   You ignored my question in my previous post asking when you think the appropriate age is. This proves you don’t know much about sex. Why does maturity have anything to do with sex? What does age have anything to do with sex when a 12 year old male can already ejaculate. Especially when this is all under the influence of safe-sex, you have no basis to say that sex is wrong outside these variables of yours.    ""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""   Funny that, it sounds as if you read all of it and didn't have anything easy to rebut so you ignored it in your next dispute. Also if you read it properly without such a bias opinion you would be less inclined to be falsely prophesizing your point of view in a spurious fashion. Here are some examples of spurious comments:  -""I had no thoughts on sex until we started learning about it. At the age of 11 at that""  -""Why should sex education be taught to pupils who are too young to have sex?""  -""Children are getting pregnant from the age of 10 nowadays” ROFL WTF?!  And now,  -""P.S. The rest of your bullshit was ignored. =D""

"Abortion is a form of murder and demeans the value of human life. When a pregnant women feels a kick in her belly, she doesn't say ""Oh, the fetus kicked"" or ""Oh, the mass of cells that hasn't become a person kicked"", she says ""The baby kicked."" Yes, after conception you have a real human being waiting to enter the world. Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib? Pro-choice advocates claim this isn't a real baby only to justify their wrong acts in their own minds. Even if you don't believe abortion is murder, it still demeans the value of human life, since women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because they're inconvenienced.  Other birth control is readily available; thus, abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control. There are dozens of birth control methods that can keep you from becoming pregnant, including the 100 percent effective one: abstinence. Maybe if abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place.  The societal contributions of a potentially valuable human being are wiped out. What would the world be like if the mothers of Abe Lincoln, George Washington, or Thomas Edison had had an abortion? Just maybe a woman has become pregnant despite all birth control attempts because the child is destined to do something great.  Women who have abortions often suffer major psychological damage from the experience along with, in some cases, the father of the child. Many women who have abortion in their younger years end up living the rest of their lives in perpetual guilt. Even if that women doesn't consider it murder at the time, that may change as she matures. Even Jane Roe (not her real name), the original woman behind the famous court decision, has completely changed her mind on abortion. She filed a petition to have the decision overturned to help relieve the guilt of hundreds of thousands of needless deaths she blames on herself. Also, let's not forget that there are two parents of every aborted child. The father may feel just as guilty. The father may even want the child, but he has no choice if the mother chooses abortion.  The advances of genetic testing may prompt more abortions (to avoid having the non-ideal child). All of us who have or want kids imagine them growing up to be doctors, senators, sports stars, or whatever. But what would you do if you knew the child would have Down's Syndrome? What would you do if you knew the child would have an intelligence level lower than that required to enter public school? What if the child had a strong risk of schizophrenia? Would you still have the child or would you want an abortion? As genetic knowledge continues to grow, we are able to determine more and more about what a child will be like as an adult. Legalized abortion could turn babies into science experiments.  There are many couples who spend years on waiting lists trying to adopt a child. The number of couples out there who cannot have a child of their own for physical reasons are too numerous to count. The waiting list for adopting babies can be 5-10 years or more. Young women in their teens are right to be concerned that they're not ready to effectively raise a child. However, if that is the case, there are plenty of wonderful people out there who are. Not only would you be bringing a valuable life into the world, you'd also be making the dream of a childless couple come true.  The abortion decision is often made by minors or young adults, who don't have the maturity and life experiences to make good decisions. There's a good reason why we don't allow people to drink alcohol, smoke, or drive until they're a certain age. It's because they haven't matured enough to make good, sound decisions. We've all made bad decisions in our younger years that provide us with life experience to make sounder judgment in the future. The one skill that seems to take the longest time to develop is the ability to consider the feelings and needs of someone besides ourselves. Why should such a life or death decision as abortion be made by a person who probably hasn't developed that capacity?   People have the right not to see their tax dollars go to something they find immoral. Abortion is a medical procedure that must be performed by a doctor. The government contributes to many health care institutions such as Healthcare for the Homeless, Planned Parenthood, free clinics, etc. All of us who pay taxes have the right to prevent that money from going to something we consider murder.   Abortion eliminates legal rights of the unborn child. The documents of our founding fathers state that we are all entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. By legalizing abortion, we take those rights away from a future American citizen. Just because the babies can't speak for themselves doesn't mean they have no rights. If a 1-month old is murdered, it that really different than abortion as far as protecting an American's life? If a person shoots and kills a pregnant woman, shouldn't the punishment be more severe? If you legalize abortion, it would tell the courts there is no difference.   Abortion exposes women to various health risks and the danger of losing fertility. Abortion exposes woman to a number of health risks including, but not limited to, infection, sterility, and in rare cases, death. A number of short-term symptoms such as bleeding, fever, nausea, and vomiting are also common.   Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath. Every American doctor must take this fundamental oath, which says ""First, do no harm"". It threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or shouldn't be harmed. Whether or not you think abortion should be allowed, it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism. Killing a human being doesn't serve any higher medical purpose and is therefore a violation of the oath.

"Ok firstly, I can find about 50 things wrong with your essay. You have spurious reasoning, invalid statistics, and a clearly bias and ethno-centric view. However I have arthritis and the clock is ticking for me to tell you as much as I can as to why this essay, is poorly executed, and appallingly deceptive.   ""When a pregnant women feels a kick in her belly, she doesn't say ""Oh, the fetus kicked"" or ""Oh, the mass of cells that hasn't become a person kicked"", she says ""The baby kicked.""""   This statement is full of a personal opinion and doesn’t contain one bit of evidence that proves your point. When she says “baby” she uses it as a euphemism. However it doesn’t matter how she uses, this statement is completely irrelevant to the argument of an un-born child’s self-awareness. Self awareness is what defines a human spirit (or soul if it helps). Hence this is a totally stupefied argument that does not prove your thesis. If you don’t know how or what self-awareness has to do with the topic of abortion, you shouldn’t even be allowed to make a post at all.    ”Yes, after conception you have a real human being waiting to enter the world. Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib?”   You again back up your statements, not with relevant statistics and data, but with personalized opinion. The question of the debate was Abortion; for or against. With this, you should build an argument based on valid points, not perspective.    ” have a real human being waiting to enter the world”    It weird how you make use of the word “real” as a twig is “real”; a rock is “real”; even dirt. Everything in the physical universe is “real”. So of course an unborn baby is “real”, what does that prove?    ” Why should taking someone's life when they're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they're a baby in the crib?”    Again, your purely prejudice statement is not backed up by any kind of fact. This is what debating is, you give fact in exchange for credibility. Also when you use a statement that implies taking life is wrong, you lay completely oblivious to the fact that as an omnivore you are involved in the deaths of hundreds of animals, hundreds of plant material and every time you wash your hands you are killing germs! You have to be clear how you direct these statements because they are meaningless in this kind of topic.    ” Pro-choice advocates claim this isn't a real baby only to justify their wrong acts in their own minds.”   They use arguments to justify there opinion, which is exactly what you are doing now. They never bluntly say an unborn child is not a sapient being without having reason to believe so. If they do say so, then ask them why and they will give you an erudite answer.   Again you use the phrase, “wrong acts in their own minds”, partly reflecting an un-backed opinion and a naïve statement reflecting your mis-interpretation the pro-choice cause.   “Women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because they're inconvenienced.”   This quote only proves you have little and a very subtracted view of why a woman would have abortion. “Inconvenient”, in the way you are implying suggests that all woman, despite rape, teen pregnancy, financial instability and risk of life to mother are inadequate reasons to have an abortion. In fact you put them in a light that makes them look greedy and unwilling. When you use the word “callous”, you unreasonably sensationalize your argument implying you have reason to change people’s opinion for personal gain rather than stating relevant statistics and articulately explaining as to why your view is more feasible.    ” abortion shouldn't be a form of birth control.”   This statement implies that you have no understanding of what birth control is as the word explains it itself. It is to regulate the chance of contraception. Abortion is used after contraception and isn’t used to prevent it.   ” 100 percent effective one: abstinence. Maybe if abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place.”   Abstinence being taught in schools is the reason why children are deprived of sexual education. Sex-ed, was implemented to combat the failure of abstinence teachings as unplanned pregnancy skyrocketed from the 1950 to this day and is still going up.    “If abortion wasn't available, people wouldn't be so careless in the first place”   I have a suggestion, why don’t you conduct a study proving your thesis? You’re saying that abortion availability determines the amount of unplanned pregnancies? Firstly, ruling out abortion all together won’t stop abortion it will just be conducted in an illegal fashion and will be incredibly unsafe.  “Every year, about 19-20 million are done by individuals without the requisite skills… 68,000 woman die as a result…Many woman travel to third world countries where abortions are legal”  - World Health Organization.    ” What would you do if you knew the child would have an intelligence level lower than that required to enter public school? ... Would you still have the child or would you want an abortion?  ”  This is the kind of backwards-thinking you’re suggesting we make. We cut back on vital scientific research with the intention of leaving us in the dark about our children’s future complications. With no in depth analysis as to why abortion is wrong on a philosophical and scientific scale, you have no structure to base your ‘banning of genetic research’ on.    “Legalized abortion could turn babies into science experiments.”   If your making assonance to anti-stem cell research, you obviously have no clue about prosthetic stem-cells that are not derived from a fetus. If not then I apologize as this sentence was totally random and had a hardly visible connection to your argument. Also who cares if babies, sapient or not become science experiments. Babies are tested all the time. Firstly they are tested for blood levels and all that sought. They are analyzed for the sake of statistics and data. They won’t be dissected if that’s what you’re suggesting. An unborn baby, assumedly an aborted fetus, is ripe for scientific discovery on the other hand. Again with no analysis as to why abortion is wrong, you have no right to say why experimenting on an aborted fetus is wrong.    “Abortion eliminates legal rights of the unborn child.”   If an unborn being never comes into existence in the first place, it cant make a choices nonetheless hence it is fallacious to ask weather its ethical to steal the right of a non-existing, un-spiritual and imamate being as rights are exclusively to the human beings, not the fetus’.    ” The documents of our founding fathers state that we are all entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”   What makes you think that when he said “we”, he was referring to humans and fetuses? A fetus is a tangible object with potential for sapience but with no current consciousness. So how can it be that an object without any mind of its own be able to possess rights that overcome it in depth?    ” By legalizing abortion, we take those rights away from a future American citizen.”   By that logic it means if I was choosing to become an American citizen in the near future, I am already entitled to American rights. I live in Australia and I am now able to possess guns, not use the metric system and pay tax to America rather than Australia. How can that possibly make sense to you?   “Abortion is against doctors' Hippocratic Oath.”   Just so you know the term Hippocratic Oath wasn’t named that way because it was hypocrisy, it was because it was named after the Greek Philosopher Hippocrates.    ” Every American doctor must take this fundamental oath, which says ""First, do no harm"".”   Almost all schools in America have abandoned that oath since 1970. It’s meaningless.   ” It threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or shouldn't be harmed.”    An abortion is a patient’s choice, not a doctor’s choice…   ” Whether or not you think abortion should be allowed, it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism.”   Again living organism is a wrong word to use. As I said before, living organism encompasses all life forms including bacteria, animals and plant life. Yes it is harming it but not harming a sapient, free-thinking being.   I hope you have the audacity to read and digest this information. I suggest you should read the rest of my material on this debate as you will soon find out that abortion is not a black and white topic but it truly relative. I hope you will also see that you have to use relevant data to back up your information rather than basing it on solid opinions.

"1. At this point in the baby's life, it does. The fetus is an individual human. A fetus is just a term for a body in the womb of a mother.  2. It is a collection of human cells with a different genetic code than the mother. It is alive and an individual. Again there are people born who are never self-aware, some who never feel, so on your view are they not people? The fetus may be dependent on the mother for survival, but so is a newborn, so is an infant, and so is a child. These are all different stages of development of an individual human being. It's not like the fetus is an organ of the mother - it is an individual human life.  3. By all biological definitions it's an individual humans. I could say you're giving me your own personal misguided feelings; it gets us nowhere. Let's stick with medical facts.  4. Again hair and nails are not individual humans - they're part of you. In the case of abortion it is killing the entire organism, akin to poisoning you to death. Not your nails or hair, but your entire self. If self-awareness is the test of personhood, again that advocates the killing of the retarded, comatose, and senile elderly. Moss and insects are a red herring.  You're getting too emotional with the argument. I don't have to be omniscient to know that it is wrong to murder innocent human beings because they inconvenience you. The fetus is a separate human life and deserves protection if any human deserves protection.  Also you don't make a distinction between killing something and that thing dying of natural causes?

The fetus is not an organ of the mother.   It is none of your business what another does with their body.   It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder.   Only religious superstition.   I haven't once made a religious statement here. I've only given statements from biology.   One of the reasons your religion is so evil and dangerous when weilded by most of you, you cannot even see your own totalitarian views on morality should you be given enough power in any situation to control others, and you will literally make-up bullshit like your argument to justify it.   Cool red herring and ad hominem.   If god doesn't like it let him come tell people otherwise. Until then tell your fellow christians to stop with the abortion doctor death threats and scaring girls on their way to clinics.   Only if you actually answer the one question I've asked and stick with biology instead of emotion.   If god is all powerful he's killing more fetuses than every abortion doctor combined.

"I never disputed this. I asked if, on your view, the retarded, senile, and comatose are all in the same boat as fetuses as none of them are self-aware and some are not feeling.   Not even close. The retarded are sentient. Comatose may wake up, senile are sentient. You refuse to accept a fetus is equal to what I've compared it to accurately. Instead making incorrect comparisons to support a misguided view.   It's a separate human life form inside the woman's body, but it in no way is a part of her body. In the same way a splinter is in my body but not a part of my body. The fetus is not an organ of the mother.   In that sense. And in that sense aborting it is morally equivalent to removing a splinter as well.   It is in the case of depriving someone else of their rights, like murder.   No it isn't, because it is not sentient.   I haven't once made a religious statement here. I've only given statements from biology.   No, you've given statements from the religious (specifically christian) mis-representations of biology and propaganda campaign. These ideas are only found on religious sites.

"1. We are all just a cluster of cells. There are some people who are never self-aware due to mental diseases. There are some people who don't feel pain because of neurological disorders. This hardly disqualifies them from humanity.   Of course it doesn't disqualify them from being considered human. But it  does  mean that they are not persons, i.e. they do not possess the essential characteristics of personhood, which are rationality, autonomy and self-consciousness.   2. I agree that in life-or-death situations, the doctors have to make a call to save the mother or the baby. This is atypical, however, and only happens in about 2-3% of all cases.   But you haven't stated whether abortion, in such unfortunate circumstances, are right or wrong.   3. The issue is not whether or not people are forced to have abortions. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. If abortion is murder, then we have a problem. We should not think the legalization of murder is ok just because no one is forcing us to murder others.   On the contrary, this  is  an issue of whether you would consider abortion as murder or not. Furthermore, you yourself seem to think that this issue is paramount to the debate since you went on to talk about the legalisation of murder and used that as an analogy.   4. This applies to murder, rape, theft, and every other crime. Of course it won't stop some people from doing it, but it will allow for law enforcement to punish for committing crimes. It will also help to educate youth on what is morally acceptable and what is morally horrid.   My question to you is: is abortion morally acceptable?   5. This issue is moot if a fetus is an individual human life. We shouldn't legalize murder to make it less hazardous to the murderer. Besides this rape is never the fault of the baby, so how does anyone have a right to kill it?   You seem to forget that rape is also never the fault of the  victim . With this being true, how can you deny the victim/mother-to-be the right to make choices concerning her own body if it is not her fault in the first place?

"1. So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people? What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.  2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.  3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.  4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.  5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.

"So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people?   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer would have to be ""no"".   What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.   No, they don't. According to the OED, autonomy is defined as ""a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws, and not subject to any higher one. b. Organic independence."" A baby that is born do have autonomy.  Self-consciousness is defined, according to the OED, as ""Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc."" As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing, he/she is said to possess self-consciousness. A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness.   2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.   It between ""a rock and a hard place"" is not the same as moral neutrality. Furthermore, morally permissible is not morally neutral. You are contradicting yourself here.   3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.   Yes, it seems like I have misread your statement. I apologise for that. And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality.   4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.   However, you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible.   5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.   First, the fetus is neither a ""child"" nor a ""baby"". Thus, your entire argument is moot. Second, while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else, you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother. As I have said, since the fetus is not a person, it would be fallacious to accrue the same rights to a fetus as you would any other person.

"I see every reason why a pro-lifer is a pro-lifer. However, I do believe it should be the woman's choice since the fetus is not born yet.

"Ugh, whenever I go into an abortion debate it gives me the distinct feeling of going to war.  Anyway, I am pro choice, because I think if you force the woman to have a child you should cut the pretense and just shove a baby-sized object up there without her consent. Roughly the same trauma and pain would be delivered except without the finiancial damage to go along with it.  I rank most orphanages as somewhere within the 9th ring of hell, at least the ones I have visisted, so adoption would just be meaner to the ""life"".  Besides, let's throw a little bit of perspective. An egg in a woman's body is always there, always waiting, and is flushed out once a month and replaced with another one. That egg is potential for life. Conception conshmeption, all the eggs are potential humans. Same for sperm (Which means I must have a higher death count than Adolf Hitler).  Now, as for fetus-is-life arguement, let's look again. See a picture of a fetus, then see a picture of a baby, or normal human. The fetus has almost no mental nor emotional functions. It's brain is not even fully developed. Even dogs can claim that their brains are fully developed. It's body is not fully developed for life outside the womb either. Until it's able to claim a basically developed human body with a basically developed human mind, it's not human (third trimester being included).  Unless you are ready to take in that unwanted child, feed it, raise it, and let it be its own person, or providing the necessary money and support to do so, do not say you are ""protecting"" life. Saving someone from being murdered is protecting life. Giving money to the homeless so they can buy something to eat is protecting life. Signing a petition saying women should be forced to live with their mistakes (not even theirs if it's rape) is not protecting life.

"As a woman who does not hold a religious stance on this but rather a personal experience stance, I think my argument holds a lot of water.   I had an abortion. I regret it deeply. I am older now and realize how selfish of a decision it was. I think because we can't see or hold or converse with the life, it is easy to dismiss but, I ALSO, almost did it again, 3 years later. I had two children already and had been basically tricked into a pregnancy I did not want. My boys were older, I had my life together and did not want another child. The issue was pushed by my partner and I was given an ultimatum. I got pregnant and he left 8 weeks into it. I was backed against a wall, scared, confused. How would I care for 3 children alone? I made an appointment and drove to Las Vegas ( hours and hours from where I lived. ) Once there I broke down in the parking lot and drove all the way home. I went through with the pregnancy and gave birth to a gorgeous little girl, met a guy that has been her dad for the last 5 years and I am reminded everytime I look at her, that the only thing that separated her from death was my unwillingness to walk up a flight of stairs. She almost wasn't here... so close. She also reminds me of the who isn't here because of a selfish decision I made. I like how so many people forget about adoption as an option...just like I did. Denying life a chance...

But I honestly believe that it is more selfish to trick yourself into thinking that you can care for a child, when you can't, and end up not giving the child the best life possible.

"Life is defined scientifically as any organism containing most or all of the following qualities:  1. Homeostasis - regulation of internal environment  2. Organization - composed of one or more structured cells  3. Metabolism - able to transform food into energy and use it  4. Growth - increasing in size or complexity  5. Adaptation - ability to change over time in response to environment  6. Response to stimuli - reacting to outside objects (recoiling when poked, etc)  7. Reproduction - ability to produce more organisms  From the moment of conception, the new cell has all of these attributes. It fits into the definition of life.  The new cell also has a unique genetic code not found in the mother.  Therefore, given the definition of life and the fact that the new life has a differing genetic code from its mother we can conclude that it is a separate human being in early stages of development. As a separate human being it has the same worth and rights as any other human being.  If this is true no other arguments matter. Size, stage of growth (children are less developed than adults, are they less than human?), and location do not matter at all. If it is an individual human being, it has all the rights and protections of all other human beings. Killing this life is tantamount to murder.

"1. I disagree with your definition of life. One must consider both scientific and philosophical perspectives for a comprehensive definition to be made.  2. A fetus does not have all of those features from the moment of conception.  3. I disagree with the assumption that a fetus is a human being. Again, one must consider both science and philosophy.  4. Killing a fetus is not tantamount to murder, in the same way that contraception is not tantamount to murder. The prevention of possible life is not tantamount to murder.

"1. What is your philosophical definition of life?  2. Yes it does. Go read any biology text book.  3. It's not an assumption, it's a deduction based off of the biological definition of life and its unique genetic code. I'll wait on your philosophical definition of life before commenting further.  4. Prevention of possible life is not murder, I agree. This goes back to defining what life is. Again I'll wait.

"1. In all instances abortion is legal except extreme circumstance we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain.  2. Nowhere in the U.S. is abortion legal after the 3rd trimester unless that cluster of cells is known to have birth defects which will kill it or the mother upon birth (again despite christian harassment and even murder of abortion doctors and their bullshit pictures of babies being sucked into a vacuum they make up and spread online like a disease).  3. No one is forcing anyone to have an abortion. If one side is not forcing one  to  abort, what gives another a right to force another  not  to abort? If you don't want an abortion don't have one, and if you think it's a sin let god handle it, he's like all powerful or something right? He doesn't need your help asshole.  4. Making abortion illegal never in the history of the world has been shown to stop abortions from happening.  5. Making abortions illegal  has  been shown to force rape victims and young girls, many of whom are practically babies themselves, to seek dangerous means for having an abortion, resulting in more deaths.

I personally know of one little girl who has massive brain damage and will never be able to fit your description. People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society. Now the incredible irony of all of this is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance. If on your view these people are persons because they have the potential of doing these things, how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?  2. ""Reproduction"" in the sense of simple life just means the ability to replicate oneself in some manner. It's not sexual reproduction, no, but that's not what the definition refers to. Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive.  Clarification: I am against abortion in all but life-or-death cases. At that point I think the doctor needs to make the call and save either the mother or the baby. The moral landscape is such at that point that it's permissible to take action one way or the other because the doctor is sworn to do everything he can to keep his patient alive.

"People in comatose (if we follow your definition of personhood) lose their personhood upon going comatose - they cannot gain knowledge, exercise wisdom, love others, find purpose, or integrate into society.   But prior to this, they can. Besides, we know that they are human beings anyway. They are independent of a natural host, and would be able to do the things I specified if they weren't afflicted by a condition. My concern is that I doubt a fetus could do those things regardless of condition.    is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance.   Not until the third trimester, in which abortion is illegal anyway. A fetus cannot do any of the things I specified maximally, if at all, prior to the third trimester. It is, by definition, a parasite until about 20 weeks or so.    how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things?   Because I obviously disagree that a fetus can do those things.   It's not sexual reproduction, no, but that's not what the definition refers to.   I know that. But when we are talking about defining  human  life, the sexual one is the only definition that matters.    Otherwise single-celled organisms which reproduce asexually wouldn't be considered alive.   I'm not disputing that they are alive. I'm disputing on the grounds that asexual reproduction is not human, which is all that needs to be considered. Thus, a fetus does not have all the biological features you or I have from the moment of conception.

So if I say anything stupid or offensive, it's nothing malicious, just ignorant.  OK, I'll accept that she is asexual. But she can't reproduce asexually, right? Meaning she has no reproductive capability. If she was able to reproduce, it would be sexually, not asexually? If so, my point still stands.   A fetus cannot sexually reproduce because it has not begun developing sexual organs yet (but it has the DNA plans to and is working on it)   I like that analogy. So I'll give my own spin.  A builder asks you if you want a new kitchen fitted for free. Obviously, you agree. You're very considerate and respectful to the builder, as he's doing it for free. You give him tea, coffee, breaks, all the perks he wants.A day later, you ask him how he's doing with the kitchen. He hands you the blueprints, and says, ""I'm working on it.""   I for one, would be seething if I had given that man perks for doing absolutely nothing builderly-like whatsoever. And I would also be incensed if I had to give full human rights to something that isn't human yet, just ""working on it.""   Newborns certainly don't have all the biological features of an adult - how does this affect their humanity?   A newborn is independent of its host. A fetus is not able to be until the third trimester.    Nay. It is not the baby's fault that the mother was raped, so she has no right to harm it.   But it's not the mother's fault she was raped. The rapist had no right to harm her. The difference between an adult woman and a fetus, is that the woman is, without a doubt, entitled to human rights. The right to choose what she does with her body. The fact that the fetus' rights are in doubt, lets the woman take precedent.    Nay. This is unfortunate, but if it is not life-or-death, how is there any justification in killing the baby?   The right to choose.    Nay.

"Sorry I'm not used to the formatting here. Thanks for the tip.   I think it's quite obvious that once the umbilical cord is cut, it is independent of its host.   Not at all. The baby still cannot feed itself. Left alone it will die, unlike even an older child who could forage for food. Newborns and young children have no such ability.   Well, so will anything.

Yes, but it isn't a fetus then. I'm not a 13 year old fetus.   You are, in the same way I'm a 22 year old child. These are just names we give to certain stages of our growth. The point is that while we have different titles for different stages of life, all of those titles are still titles of humans. The difference between a child and an adult is stage of development, as is the difference between a fetus and adult.   But at this point, it's extremely difficult to say that it is truly human.   It fits the biological definition of life and has an individual human genetic code. It is biologically classified as an individual human being.   A fetus cannot do this, thus scientifically, it is not fully human.   Neither can a child nor someone who is asexual by defect. Are they not fully human on your view?

It would be silly to expect a fetus to make reproductive organs before other things like a heart, skin, etc.   A newborn is independent of its host. A fetus is not able to be until the third trimester.   See first point.   But it's not the mother's fault she was raped. The rapist had no right to harm her.   You're right. However that in no way gives her the right to harm the baby. That's like stealing someone's wallet because someone else stole yours - it makes no sense.   The right to choose what she does with her body.   But she's not killing her own organ. She's not getting an ear pierced or anything. She's choosing what to do with the baby's body, not hers. She's killing the individual life inside her, not one of her own organs or tissues.   The right to choose.   To choose what, though? To end the life of another who has not wronged anyone? Isn't that the very definition of murder? I agree the mother should be able to do whatever she wants with her own body, but the baby is not a part of her - it's just geographically located in her for the time being.   I must say, that was a very refreshing and innovative take on the question.   Thank you.

"Personally, I am in the middle. In cases where either a) upon being born, the fetus will have died or killed the mother or b) when the person became pregnant as a result of rape or sexual assault, abortion is OK. However, people who get pregnant as a result of pure stupidity (not using protection, for example) should not be permitted to abort.

"Abortion violates the NAP in that it causes harm to another living thing, and so I cannot support it. As well, I cannot comprehend how anybody can think that their own choice trumps the right to the life of another; I am alive, if another life is alive because of me, but can be terminated by me at a moment's notice, in what universe is it acceptable for me to put my own personal desires ahead of that of the other life? It is a different story if you choose to kill yourself, but to choose to kill somebody else... That's simply ludicrous to me.

"Being alive is the most valuable and precious thing on earth, and I don't see why people take death lightly. Anyone could walk out of their house one day and get killed by a bus, or any vehicle. Life is too short. If a person decides to have sex unprotected, they should be able to make this choice with the consequences in mind. Everybody who has sex is old enough to know the consequences and with sex education being compulsory on the national curriculum there really is no excuse. The NHS will give out free contraception so there is no way that you can say it isn't available in this country. If you value life, then you would never have an abortion, abortions in my opinion are given out too freely and are an easy way out for someone who was so stupid enough not to take contraception. During childbirth, so many drugs and forms of giving births are available so there is no excuse why (except medical conditions) that a woman wouldn't be able to give birth.

"if mother does not care about her future child and wants to make an abortion, she should think about herself because, there are 2 types of abortion: safe and unsafe   annually, 500 million women of childbearing age who die from causes related to pregnancy, 15% of deaths due to complications of unsafe abortion  I'm personally against abortion

"1. We are all just a cluster of cells. There are some people who are never self-aware due to mental diseases. There are some people who don't feel pain because of neurological disorders. This hardly disqualifies them from humanity.  2. I agree that in life-or-death situations, the doctors have to make a call to save the mother or the baby. This is atypical, however, and only happens in about 2-3% of all cases.  3. The issue is not whether or not people are forced to have abortions. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. If abortion is murder, then we have a problem. We should not think the legalization of murder is ok just because no one is forcing us to murder others.  4. This applies to murder, rape, theft, and every other crime. Of course it won't stop some people from doing it, but it will allow for law enforcement to punish for committing crimes. It will also help to educate youth on what is morally acceptable and what is morally horrid.  5. This issue is moot if a fetus is an individual human life. We shouldn't legalize murder to make it less hazardous to the murderer. Besides this rape is never the fault of the baby, so how does anyone have a right to kill it?

"1. We're a self-aware, feeling cluster of cells. But a fetus does not equate mental retardation. It would more accurately compare to moss, or perhaps a very stupid lady bug.  2. I'm glad we agree here at least. But from where will the doctors come to perform this life saving surgery should it be all but illegal? It seems they would be hard to find after this puritanical cleansing.  3. It is about force, actually, being as it has been established well that abortion is not murder. It is the force of a belief system, and a faulty one at that.  4. Ah, so it is not about saving lives, it is about righteous revenge. I always suspected as much.  5. Seems we've been over this point a couple times now. Abortion is not murder.
",1
"1. The comparison is a bad one. Neither moss nor lady bugs have human DNA. A human fetus has a distinct human DNA code from its mother. The complexity of an organism during development does not affect what it is; a child is less complex than an adult, but both are human.  2. From the same place they performed life-or-death abortions before: the hospital or doctor's office. Abortion has always been legal in life-or-death cases.  3. Look over at my post on the other side of the debate and refute those points, please. It's not well-established that it's not murder. Truth is not relative to our current laws.  4. Laws are put in place with punishments attached to keep people from doing those acts. Laws will never stop those who flaunt them, only punish those who are caught. That should not stop laws from being in place.  5. Again refer to my points.

"I'm against abortions for the most part; I don't believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control as with upwards of 80% of the cases. There are ways to prevent pregnancy which are very effective and to me if a person ignores the use of birth control they should assume responsibility for their actions.  On the other hand, there are many instances where birth control has failed, cannot be taken due to allergies, or where rape is a contributing factor to where I would support a woman’s decision if she where to not go through with the pregnancy.  As for not being able to sustain a baby financially, emotionally, or intellectually, adoption is an option, saying that you want to abort because you didn't  feel  like taking or wearing birth control is a poor excuse and shouldn't be encouraged or supported.

"I thought about it some more. I think even tho both male and female are responsible for the pregnancy, the female is more responsible. Why? She allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg.   You said  the man allowed his sperm to fertilze her egg. blame the man?   I would blame the man if he aggresively allowed his sperm. Meaning, it was rape.   I don't believe in accidental pregnancies. You might say, what if a condom breaks? That is why on the box it says 99 percent safe.   And i know that the sperm don't ask permission. I don't understand what you mean by that question. ???  I honestly downvoted you and i thought some more afterwards. I gave your vote back (don't really much care if you care for votes) but i wanna when is pregnancy accidental?   Sperm comes out due to orgasm. So the man can predict when the sperm comes out or not. Which mean it is not an accident. If somehow a man get out his sperm without feeling anything...i would consider that an accident. I am going to make a debate about it.

"I thought about it some more. I think even tho both male and female are responsible for the pregnancy, the female is more responsible. Why? She allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg.   If you only 'blame' the man when he rapes the woman, shouldn't you conversely only blame the woman if she rapes the man? In consensual sex, both partners are equally involved in the decision to give the sperm and the egg the opportunity to meet. You say ""she allowed the sperm to fertilize her egg"" like it came knocking on the door of her egg and she decided to let it in.  What do you feel is gained from assigning blame to anybody?   I don't believe in accidental pregnancies. You might say, what if a condom breaks?

I would think a review of the definition would be enough to show that yes, accidental pregnancies exist, whether or not you believe in them. When you engage in an activity, you are not automatically consenting to allow the potential negative consequences of that activity to run their course without interference.   For example, every time you get in a car, you realize there is a possibility you will get in a car accident. This does not mean you are consenting to being injured without trying to reverse or mitigate your injuries. You are engaging in activity, recognizing the risks and doing your best to prevent them while still intending to undo any damage that may occur. Removing any sentimentality from the issue of abortion, it is no different. Pregnancy is an occasional consequence of sex and abortion is a way of dealing with that consequence.

"There is no point of arguing over abortion in my eyes. Why? Because if a woman wants to kill her own child, then she will.   When there is a will there is way.

"[In my point of view, abortion shouldn't be banned. Abortion is a not bad thing for women, especially for teenagers. Everybody thinks that abortion is wrong, but most of those people even haven't been pregnant. It is easier to talk about it and to say that women shouldn't have an abortion, but when it happens it is very hard to make a choice.   When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Abortion is not very good, of course. But it is not wrong. It is a choice. It is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons.   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant. You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do? Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong? I don't think so. You would think, even for a minute you would think about abortion.  What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Abortion is a murder. I agree with that. But everybody has a right to be wrong. Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it. We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion. As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.  How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   So, I can say that all of us make mistakes, we are not perfect. Nobody does. But we have to think without emotions and to fix our mistakes.   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.  But if woman decided not to have a child, it is not wrong.  It is not good, but not wrong.]

"When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Why not? If you have an opinion on something, do you intend for it only to apply to you? Or to everyone? If you think smoking is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone. If you think killing is morally wrong, do you think it is wrong for only you to do? Or for anyone to do?   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant.   Are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception? Or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species (ie sex)?    You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do?   Consider birth control before I had sex. Now that it is too late, I would accept responsibility for my actions, or inaction as the case may be.    Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong?   No, I wouldn’t want to end the life of the fetus because the fetus having been conceived are direct results of my irresponsibility in not using birth control or making the guy use it (assuming we are not talking about an immaculate conception). Religious ethics based on the idea of ‘sin’ or ‘evil’ has no effect on my decision; it’s about how I was raised.   What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire. And you probably won’t ever forget about that either, in fact, you’ll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control.   Abortion is a murder.   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   But everybody has a right to be wrong.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.    Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion.   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really  fix  it?   How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.  I am totally against abortion as a form of birth control when actions can be taken to prevent conception in the first place. As for situations of rape or failed preventative birth control, i am pretty much indifferent about whether or not a woman want's to be a mom or have an abortion. I don't care about abortion in as much as a person being responsible for their actions. If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.

A lot of people who are against abortion really judge those who are for abortion. But everybody has to have own opinion. I have mine, as well as you have yours.    Are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception? Or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species (ie sex)?   Hey, there are a lot of teenagers who become pregnant. I wrote it just as an example, because I know one girl who was in that situation.    Consider birth control before I had sex.

Yes it is a good option, but it is very hard to give the baby up for adoption, when you gave a birth to him, when this little baby had been under your heart for 9 months. Also there could be any reasons why woman cannot be pregnant for this period. It is not so easy to be pregnant ‘alone’ (if we are talking about that bad situation)   Yes, people should think before having sex, but everybody makes mistakes. And everybody solves their problems as they can. Somebody is strong enough to take a responsibility for the baby, but somebody cannot. It is their choice. :)   Murder is unlawful killing, abortion is legal therefore not unlawful, nor murder.   You confused me. )) I didn’t get you. I didn’t mean lawful, or unlawful. I meant that by abortion people kill their babies.   I don’t think that it’s a right. Maybe a privilege.   A privilege? Don’t know. I think that a privilege is something that is given to someone after doing something good.   Everybody can be wrong. Do you agree with that? We cannot live without mistakes. It teaches us how to be better, by making mistakes we can understand what is right and what is wrong, or something like that.   What about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes? I agree that once a mistake is made, that one should fix it, but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion.   I agree with you, that we should take the responsibility in preventing mistakes. But there could be different situations, when people cannot control them. Somebody are not wise enough, somebody doesn’t think before doing something. But life is intended for us to self-perfection. It is a life. We learn from the mistakes of a lifetime. Somebody has to do his own mistakes to understand something, somebody can understand from the mistakes of others. People are different. That is why our life is very interesting. :)   So first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime? Where do we draw the line?   In our society it wouldn’t be understandable if the offenders of homicide wouldn’t be punished. Of course they should be punished. But in my opinion they should be punished only be God. But our society wouldn’t accept it, and I understand why. We are living in the world where some people should be punished like going to jail or something like that, because it is a good way for other people to live quietly. So that offenders also can fix their mistakes after a jail, for example. They are also people. They just make more serious mistakes like murder, or something.   Well no, not technically murder. It is killing, but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity? Doing so may help you sleep at night, but does it really fixit?   I think it is. In any case, it would be better then doing nothing, right? The most important thing when you understand you mistakes. Of course, a person cannot give a life for exactly that person he killed. :) it is impossible physically, but giving a life for somebody else is an answer too I think. Have you seen the film “Seven pounds” with Will Smith? This film describes what I am talking about very good. He killed 7 people, and it was his mistake. But after that he helped 7 other people. I understood that abortion is not so bad after watching it.    If a person steals, wouldn’t it be ‘fixing it’ to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from?   Yes, in my opinion, it is a best solution, but if for example the person from whom you stole is dead for example, you cannot give the money back to him. In that case, you can give them to somebody who needs it. may be for charity? )   One does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth. Giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isn’t able to be a good parent.   Yes, it is a good option, of course. But there are several options: to take responsibility for child and to bring him up yourself, to give him to an adoption agency, or to have an abortion. (there can be some other options, I don’t know). But each person should choose himself and to take responsibility for his actions and decisions.    If people took more responsibility, then abortion would be less of an issue in the world.   A agree with you. But there are a lot of people who cannot take responsibility even for themselves, that is why we have a lot of options.   Of course, I wouldn’t have an abortion, because I love children and I want them, but I do not exclude it. If I would in a situation I described earlier, I would do it. But in other cases I wouldn’t.   But abortion is not wrong.   Abortion is an option. Option which is judged by someone, which is supported by someone, which is not understandable by someone, but a lot of women do it and they will do it in spite of other people’s opinions. And that is their choice.

If a baby cannot survive outside the womb, or outside of an artificial womb known as an incubator, there is nothing morally or ethically wrong about aborting that said baby. A child changes the lives of many people involved. If that child cannot be brought into a life of happiness and a healthy, stable environment- they really don't need to be brought into the world at all. We're there medically.

Also, parents are often given the option to separate the twins even when it will almost certainly kill one of them. They can make a decision, on behalf of one child, to kill his/her twin ""at will with impunity.""    Should parents have the right to kill their infants, toddlers, teenagers and etc because parents must labor(perhaps at an unenjoyable job) for their children? What about the children's physical autonomy?   If a parent wants to end their commitment to an infant, toddler, teenager, etc., why resort to killing them? They can disown them, and the commitment is terminated without impinging on physical autonomy.    Rather, if mandatory organ donations from the living were passed into law, the goverment would be saying that the sick has a greater physical autonomy than the healthy.   Yes, I did mean mandatory organ harvesting from living individuals.   To dispense with unnecessary health qualifiers, it would be saying that one person's physical autonomy is less important than another person's life. I do not see how this is distinguishable from abortion; both are cases where, if one party's physical autonomy is removed, another party's life could be preserved. Except, in the case of abortion, the benefiting party is not a person yet.

No, but an acorn is the nut of an oak tree, and a chicken egg is the egg of a chicken, it would be a scientific anomaly if they were to grow into anything else. Are you denying that we are referring to a human fetus? what did you think this debate was about?  Regardless, we’re not talking about an acorn or egg, both of those have all the necessary parts to develop into their adult counterparts on their own, save for proper sunlight and water for the seed or warmth for the egg. A human fetus requires another life to create it and then sustain it until well into adolescence. Whether it is a nine week old fetus or a nine day old newborn baby, it requires another life form. This should be considered  before  people decide to just skip out on the birth control and take the risk of having an unwanted pregnancy.   Personally I don't give a fuck if people get abortions, I doesn't affect me in the least so why should I care? Living things die every day; death is just a part of life. What I  do  care about are people taking responsibility for their actions. If you don't want a baby, no duh, don't get pregnant. If you take the proper precautions to prevent pregnancy and get pregnant anyway or if, god forbid, you were to get raped, then by all means, have an abortion if that’s what you want. No skin off my nose.  And what’s with the personal insult? Grow up? I think it’s obvious from that remark alone that I am not the one lacking maturity.

I have an ""against"" point of view, just because I don't think that abortion is an exit from a situation whe you are pregnant, it can not be that easy. Before a girl should think about things to prevent unwanted pregnancy. There are a lot of pills, birthcontrols and some kind of technological equipments which may help without harming young girl's organism. Secondly I don't find it morally impoverished. It's basically a murder. Just think of it! Every day there are a lot of embryos thrown into huge garbage bins. Those were supposed t be future children and just because of silly ""parents"" they weren't given a chance to live.

She can not get pregnant, because of that.

"Abortion is immoral because it eliminates life.   When it comes to rape, women can have choice to abort or not abort. I support either decision. However, it is immoral to abort always. I also believe it is selfish.   If you are just careless, don't abort. It is not the anybody's fault but the female's fault. Why not the man's fault too? Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg. Therefore, when a woman's get pregnant, it is the woman's fault only. Except when the situation comes to rape but this is not rape.

In all instances abortion is legal except extreme circumstance we know scientifically beyond doubt (despite christian blitz misinformation campaign on the subject) that the cluster of cells is not self-aware and is not capable of feeling pain.  2. Nowhere in the U.S. is abortion legal after the 3rd trimester unless that cluster of cells is known to have birth defects which will kill it or the mother upon birth (again despite christian harassment and even murder of abortion doctors and their bullshit pictures of babies being sucked into a vacuum they make up and spread online like a disease).  3. No one is forcing anyone to have an abortion. If one side is not forcing one to abort, what gives another a right to force another not to abort?

"Yes, There is no shame, women fail to carry a fetus to term more often than not without artificially inducing rejection, medical abortion only artificially induces this natural process, the artificiality of inducing this seems like it has no more moral significance than it occuring naturally. This is because the fetus doesnt develp consciousness until the onset of the third trimester - prior to this point (more than ~99% of all abortions occure in the 1st trimester) there is no moral status to the actions taken with regards to the preservation of the fetus. This is true for surgical abortions too since they also occure during the first trimester.   The morality of abortion has to do with the freedom to have them, not the act of doing them, since the act of doing them is for all reasonable accounts an a-moral action. It should be everyone's right to have an abortion because people should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions.

"It definitely should be legal and be allowed for all women.  Everyone has the right on live. However, there is a question: Who is this «everyone», whether it is an adult, teenager, newborbaby or fetus in the womb?  or When, at what moment the human embryo becomes a person with the right to life?  It may be argued that the nervous system is the main function for life. However, up to embryonic day 14, embry has no central nervous system and, therefore, cannot be considered as a human being who has senses. Thus, it seems that an embryo is not human and abortion should not be considred as murder.

"I am so on the basis of Natural Rights. At some point, the living thing inside a woman's womb becomes a human being. I do not believe this to be at conception, and I cannot define exactly when that point is. But it is fairly clear to me that it is not one instant before birth. My daughter was born six weeks premature. If she had not been premature, would it have been legitimate to abort her two weeks later? Would it be legitimate for a woman to delay labor via drugs and have her baby aborted past the time it was actually due? And finally, most late-term abortions amount to clear infanticide, as the baby is actually living outside of the womb before it is killed. Must I accept this in order to be ""pro-choice"" in your eyes? Must I oppose a first-trimester abortion of a rape or incest victim in order to be ""pro-life""?  You make the argument that ""pro-life"" people should be for legal abortion, since legal abortion leads to fewer abortions and deaths of mothers having abortions. I question these data. Most of the countries where abortion is illegal are poorer and have other problems -- it is thus hard to isolate the effect of abortion laws on abortion rates.  But, for the sake of argument, let's say you are right: Would this then also justify any other crime? What if the legalization of murdering one person a year was demonstrated to reduce the total number of violent crimes -- could it be justified? You are using utilitarian ethics, whereas many non-religious and some religious abortion opponents use Natural Rights ethics. Utilitarianism allows for any abrogation of rights if it can be seen as being ""in the common good,"" whereas Natural Rights allow for no such abrogations. There is nothing hypocritical about being a Natural Rights-based opponent of abortion.

"It is true that an 'is implies ought' argument is not valid with regards to plastic surgery. With the plastic surgery part of my argument, although pointing out the current frivolity of its existence, I was hoping to emphasize the fact that resource use and waste has more to do with the economic demand, not the equitable distribution of resources in spite of the economics. Having a greater population will not reduce this problem, it will only amplify the numbers of people that have insufficient access (A pro-life world increases the overall suffering in the world because scarcity is increased - you could think of this as a utilitarian point to make, though I am not a utilitarian). Population growth is the biggest reason why people go without, scarcity is defined in terms of population, ie if there were 100 people the notion of scarcity would be unreasonable.   -I was not suggesting that prenatal care or the rearing of a child is necessarily a waste of resources - the discussion was about resources and with a greater population there are thus less resources per person to be distributed, thus by adding more to our population such that it is continuing to grow, rather than meeting or being less than the replacement rate, creating greater desperation in any given population - if you know anything about sociology you would understand that most of the desperation of scarcity effects children and young mothers (abortion reduces this). I was trying to say that the amount of resources that are used in raising a child are vastly greater than having an abortion. Abortion solves the problem of using more resources (even though it does use some ~500-700 dollars worth) and the problem of over population (not increasing it as much) - There would be more resources for less population thus the quality of life individually and society generally would increase. The only way using resources on child rearing is a waste is if the people turn out badly and are a drain on society. There are not enough resources. Have you ever read freakanomics? if you have, you would know that there is a statistically significant link between crime rates and the incidences of abortions in this country - i.e ~18 years after abortion was legalized and abortions were more frequent, crime rates took a precipitous decline in the mid to late 80's (not a point necessarily to justify abortions, just a point to demonstrate the link between crime and desperation and the population that are born into scarcity). IF abortions were clearly wrong i would not think they are justified even if they caused a decline in crime.   -When you said that you are looking at the rule that I had described - I was refering to the statistical likelihood that unwanted children tend to have unproductive lives, be criminals, be on welfare, have teen pregnancies, use drugs, etc...  -When i said that the father is important you seemed to think that i was implying legal basis, but I was not, I am not sure why you argued against my statement there, i was thinking in terms of how the relationship ought to be considered.   -You could argue that they confer legal rights to the father but wouldnt have any constitutional justification in doing so. I agree that there are issues with a woman being able to hold a man responsible after birth even if he didnt want it, however rather than forcing her to have a child based on his rights, i think that there should be legal choice to abdicate rights after the birth of an unwanted child.  -""if I were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant, there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants aren't moral agents."" - I dont know if the moral issue of your scenario has to do with the intrinsic value of the plants. It is generally more to do with the extrinsic value of the plants being wiped out and the effect this has on the species that are worthy of moral consideration and the integrity of the biosphere that sustains complex life. Thus it gets back to the entities of intrinsic moral value - human beings (biologically human and agents which have attained consciousness), and I would also argue other morally aware species like dolphins and pigs and chimps but then you get into trans species ethics which is a different topic.

"Regardless of a biased opinion of whether abortion is 'shameful' or not, abortion should absolutely be legal. A woman has rights to her own body, as do men to their own. It is arguable that it is 'killing' or 'murdering' a creature, but you cannot end something that hasn't ever been started. Women's rights to their very own bodies should not be violated because of less open minds. It should never be a question that women are unaffected by the choices they make every day. I conclude with, it is only the choice of the maker of the decision, and that decision is none other than the person that is in direct control of it, especially if it directly effects the health of a one persons body.

"I agree with you until you said: ""It is arguable that it is 'killing' or 'murdering' a creature, but you cannot end something that hasn't ever been started.""  The fetus being killed most certainly has been started. It is a human being. It may not have any great capacity for intelligent thoughts or feelings, but neither do newborns. Is it OK to kill them too?  I will agree with you other point that women (and men) should be able to do whatever it is they want to their own bodies. But in the case of abortion, this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body, but the body of another human being still attached to her. No one should have the right to kill innocent people.

But in the case of abortion, this right does not apply because it does not only pertain to the woman's body, but the body of another human being still attached to her.   No, you're wrong here. The fetus is considered a parasite. According to the OED, the scientific definition of a parasite is ""An animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism (technically called its host) and  draws its nutriment directly from it . Also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others, but not at their expense (strictly called commensal or symbiotic); also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance, as the cuckoo, the skua-gull, etc."" (Emphasis my own)  All a woman does to continue with the pregnancy is to allow the fetus to live within her and draw nutrients from her. Conversely, when a woman chooses to abort the fetus, she is simply  dis allowing the fetus to continue living within her.   No one should have the right to kill innocent people.   The fetus, within the first trimester, is not a person.

The fetus, within the first trimester, is not a person.   You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human, but rather parasites.

You made the point earlier that unborn babies are not human, but rather parasites. Unborn babies still fit the definition of ""parasite"" regardless of what trimester they're in.

"It would be really unfair if the mother was raped and she has to bear the emotional pain of having the child. If the mother was careless and say she was in high school, she would have to drop out of high school to take care of her child. In this cases I think abortion should be legal. Its true that the mother should have been more careful but should she ruin her whole life with one mistake? Through all this what about the child's feelings? If the mother was raped would she be able to take care of the child properly without having a emotional grudge against the child. I heard that the pain from rape never truly leaves you, you move on but you never truly get over it. The child would also have to grow up without a father. If the mother gave birth to the child in high school, she would have to drop out. The child will not be able to receive the full attention the child deserves from his mother if shes trying to take care of the child and study/work at the same time. It would be even worse if the father did not take responsibility like in some cases of teenage pregnancy. In other cases where women of any age are pregnant but are not prepared to take care of the child they give the child for adoption. The child would grow up in an orphanage without ever knowing his real parents. If the child is adopted, how would the child feel? The child might live with hate for his biological parents for as long as he lives and if he is not, does the child deserve to grow up in an orphanage without parents?

People all need to realize that if a baby is not going to make it, the mother is not going to make it, or both aren't going to make it through birth.

Why else do soldiers get injured/killed trying to save people from minefields?   Childbirth is dangerous    Just how often to mothers die during childbirth now-a-days?   If she goes through with the pregnancy she will have a human being she will be obligated to care for.   Two answers to that:  Put the baby up for adoption.  Leave the baby at a firestation.

You're older than me, probably a few steps closer to making your own children than I am. Is your life worth more than mine? Surely you must think so. A fetus is closer to being born than a sperm, just as you are closer to creating a fetus than I am.

I am much more capable of creating life than a fetus. I have much more potential at this time. Sure, the fetus has the potential to one day be like me, but right now it is not.

"Many proponents of abortion say that it is up to the mother to decide what happens to her body. However, they seem to be forgetting one key matter: does the baby not have a choice as to it's body? Some say that cancer is alive and that by killing it we are ending a life. However, cancer will never gain sentience; cancer will never learn; cancer will never go to school. Cancer is like a parasite, feeding off of the body and expanding until the body is dead.   I am completely for the use of the term 'fetus.' The excuse for the abortion is that the baby is not yet a baby, rather only a fetus. That is where they are wrong. A fetus is just as much a human as I am, it simply has not progressed to the point in life I which I have reached. Soon it shall be a baby, then it shall progress to toddlerhood, then to childhood, then to adolescence. It is not a baby, but it shall become one - just as an adolescent is not an adult, but it too shall become one.

"OK first off Abortion IS murder weather you believe it or not it IS.  Example:   Scott Peterson in trial was convicted of TWO murders not ONE but TWO why two though?  He just killed his wife?  His wife was pregnant. The baby inside of his wife was killed in the process of the mother being killed.  If the supreme court agrees with abortions yet charge Peterson with two murders what are they thinking?!  Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human ""spirit"" or ""soul"" inside of it (for those who are religious).  So if you were to ""dispose"" of this body that IS alive and has a human ""soul"" within it isn't it the same as murder?  Your taking away the life of some creature that has not yet experienced life yet.  The baby moves, blinks, kicks, and squirms inside the mother, this is the sign that it is alive and is capable of understanding of what is doing (not of everything its doing) and human beings do just the same.   So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.   And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person. Then, put a giant vacuum tube into the container and suck all there body parts out.  Is this murder?   Some people will say ""Oh well, that isn't the same. That person is fully developed and eduacated""  There is no difference between killing the grown body and that of a one inside a mother.  Weather it's there choice or not to get the abortion it IS still murder.  People should understand the consequences of having sex and abortion should not be a option. It leads to people saying ""Oh I can just get it aborted so I don't have to worry about it."" &lt;- LAZINESS.  We already have enough lazy citizens in the US I don't think we need anymore.

So if you were to ""dispose"" of this body that IS alive and has a human ""soul"" within it isn't it the same as murder?""   Is this a quantifiable statement. Are we capable of saying that 2 minutes after conception, that bundle of 8 or so cells is not just a human being, but has an intangible ""soul"". And those toe nails i just clipped that are made up of millions of cells, or if a hair gets plucked along with the root that still has a lot more than 8 cells, those have souls too? At what point is the now separate entity no longer ""you""?  If one wears protections, is that not killing potential for having something with a ""soul""? Or is the woman's period also murder because it also is killing the potential for a new human being?   ""So lets put a full grown man/women inside a glass incubator filled with water and have them semi-conscious.  And then lets put a drug in there to kill this person.

I really don't understand how it's possible to say that a human being, having been alive, having consciousness, can be compared (even in a drugged stupor) to a collection of relatively inanimate bunches of cells. I agree that at a certain point, when the fetus has begun to kick and to show brain activity, that it is now murder to have an abortion. But up until that point, I believe the mother has a right to terminate the pregnancy.  Additionally, you are forming your opinion based on an assumption that all accidental pregnancies happen through laziness. But what if the child has some terrible genetic disease that will render their life to be agonizing. I remember someone referenced a disease on CD where the baby lives for about an hour after birth in terrible pain. Wouldn't it then be mercy then to prevent this from happening before the bunch of cells has become conscious? Or if the woman was a victim of rape or incest, and she got pregnant. I doubt that she would love this child if she carried it to term, and so the child would probably be emotionally malnourished the rest of its life. Would you want to sentence someone to that kind of life?  Another way of looking at is, okay the courts and legislature have agreed to your point of view. Abortions are now illegal. However, that does not mean that people wanting abortions aren't going to happen, and it also doesn't mean that people will stop getting abortions. Women who don't want to or can't carry a child to term will be forced to go to back alley doctors to perform the abortion (or perhaps worse, try to do it themselves) and those unqualified doctors' abortions could lead to their own death in addition to the fetus'. Also, those back alley doctors will no longer have restrictions placed upon them. They will be able to terminate a pregnancy well after consciousness has begun and the fetus is now a baby. Even when abortion is legal, this kind of stuff happens too much, and imagine how much worse it would be if abortion by qualified doctors was illegal.

"""Once the a egg is fertilized and starts to grow into a human body it has a human ""spirit"" or ""soul"" inside of it (for those who are religious).""  This is the heart of the anti-abortion argument, the idea that what makes a human being ""human"" is his or her soul, and that that soul is present from the moment of conception on. It matters not that at the moment of conception the zygote has less cells then you have fingers on one hand, it is the moral equivalent of a human being because it has a soul.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing the idea. It is a religious idea and in this, a country with religious freedom, you are free to believe that idea and to live your life in accordance with that and other religious beliefs.

There are many situations under which you are completely wrong. People need to take responsibility for the amount of children being born into broken homes and poverty.

"""It moves, it eats, it grows, it thinks.  Are these not all the contributing factors of how our bodies are alive?""  Absolutely, and I think that most of us on the pro-choice side would agree that a woman's right to chose ends by the time a fetus reaches the stage where it eats or thinks.  But the anti-abortion side is not content with that. They want to outlaw abortion from the very moment of conception, at which time the ""organism"" as you call it does not eat, does not move and does not think.

"yeah so people have the right to decide. certain things happen in life and some people may not be able to support a baby. if a girl gets raped and becomes pregnant does she really want to carry that man's child? i wouldn't. plus some women have serious conditions so if they do carry a child to term they could die in labor. this is not good and they should have an abortion to save their life. it's simply not our choice to decide what people want to do with their bodies and if they feel it is not killing someone then it is not on our plates it is on theirs.

"While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure. By going ahead with an abortion, you are denying someone, or atleast something life. Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.   Had the fetus not been terminated, it could've had so much potential. It would grow up to be a child. It would get to listen to music, smell the first day of spring and catch the first glimpse of snow. Everything we take for granted in life and life itself, is taken from the fetus.   Many argue that an unborn child does not have consciousness and therefore, it is morally acceptable to undergo an abortion. In the same sense, is it alright to inject lethal toxin into a child that has been sedated for his whole life? Pro-choice people are therefore saying that we can deny life to something that has never experienced consciousness. This argument is irrational and morally incorrect.  What's more worrying is that the mother of a fetus makes this decision. The very provider of life and sustenance refuses to let her unborn child live. It is not her choice to make. It is no one's choice to make. No one should have the authority to deny an unborn child life. Imagine the world without you, because your mother had an abortion. You would never live all of your experiences. You would never have emotions. You would've never existed. Such is the travesty of abortion. Over a million lives, of which collectively would add up to over 70 million years, would never be lived.  Rape, sadly does happen. But legalizing abortion does not solve the problem. If we want to reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies as a result of rape, then we need to tackle the issue of rape itself. Harsher penalities, stricter monitoring policies, promoting rape whistles, reducing poverty and a nationwide sex offender registry are all possible solutions for this. Reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies from rape down to zero is next to impossible, but we can get this number a lot lower.   Unwanted adult and teenage pregnancies can be solved by removing the social stigma associated with contraceptives. Pharmacies and the government should advocate the use of condoms or birth control pills as a way to enjoy sex without any unwanted consequences.  Abortion means denying the opportunity of life to what would've been a someone. We cannot continue with this madness.

Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.    It's a poetic argument but it's deeply irrational because the sentiment you employed isn't used for anything else in the world. Specifically I'm referring to the fact that the choices we make often deny others life in some obscure way. For example, assuming you live in the United States, by voting in leaders who continue to engage in war, you are enabling people in a far away country the right to life. But it gets worse, but refusing to lobby or protest for military action in Somalia you are allowing an area of the world to exist which destroys lives every second. How about poverty? How many people in the favelas in Brasil are being butchered as we speak and yet we're doing nothing?  Let's take the argument to its logical extremes. If you've ever used birth control, or engaged in any form of sexual act without procreation as the aim, you are destroying millions of cells that could have been a person. Suppose you only ever engaged in reproductive sex, what about spontaneous abortions that happen all the time and are not even noticed? How about our recent advances in biology, specifically genetic engineering and cloning. How much DNA have you destroyed that could have been cloned into another person?  The only point I'm trying to make is that although your argument is very kind in its intentions and poetic, it's too absolute to apply to life in this world. We have to recognise that lives can have priority. Sure a fetus could be a person, but the mother is already a person and her wants and needs outweigh a possible person. Sure, the starving and innocent in South America deserve support, but first we need to get our country better off so that we can afford the massive donations to infrastructure.

Your attempts to elicit emotion by conflating fetuses with infants also does nothing to me because I feel no emotion towards them either. We may as well be discussing the building of a fence.

"I like how you've become more radical with your ideas :)   Most great ideas are radical, but there's a downside: You have to be prepared to defend it from those who don't like radical ideas. You'll also need to refine this idea to make it workable and more convincing.    Something like this might work better : Keep abortions legal and well regulated but make it expensive, effectively imposing a monetary fine on unwanted pregnancies, a jail term may be considered to further deter unwanted pregnancies. Over time, this program will be just like the introduction of seatbelts in cars, people will no longer need to be reminded to avoid unwanted pregnancies, effectively eliminating abortions.

"It's easy to manage that by introducing a time delay so the law will take effect 24 months from its introduction. This is done all the times to allow people and the industry to prepare and adjust to any new laws.   .  24 months should allow 12 months for a government campaign to make the public aware of the new law before they decide to engage in sexual activities that may result in a pregnancy. After that you still have a 3-month buffer if you're not yet aware of the new law, the remaining 9 months is so that people who became pregnant during this campaign period is not disadvantaged if they're still not yet aware of the new law. All this can be left to the trusty government bureaucratic systems to hash out, that's their job, and they're good at it :)

"Destroying a fetus is like destroying a part of yourself. One's genes, blood and cells are within the body of a their fetus, yet they undergo an abortion and prevent a human life from being lived. A fetus does not deserve to be denied life, because the fetal stage is probably is the stage of life where we are morally the most neutral. We cannot think for ourselves, nor can we comprehend good or bad. On this basis, infants are also considered innocent. Why deny life to something that does not deserve such a fate?

"""A baby is a baby the moment the sperm meets the egg. Even though the heartbeat does not start until later, it's still a baby in my eyes.""   You should be more careful of beliefs like this, because they are a double-edged sword.  To clarify, when you believe in something as absurd as that, you are also arguing that a baby (as in, the life which has exited the womb) is equal to a single ball of cytoplasm in value and respectability.  In other words, you define the concept of ""baby"" to be so wide that the word no longer engenders feelings of protection to fetuses, or even zygotes, but instead spills over the image of an incomplete, mass of of cells with no self-awareness onto post-birth babies.  All of a sudden a baby is a mass of tissues and a brain with no true self awareness, all because you thought it sentimental to attach its name onto a mass of an obvious pre-life.

"If it is not considered life when the egg is fertilized and is starting to grow, the when does it become a life. Where is the line between a incomplete mass of cells and a life.   The best line I can determine is when an offspring becomes self-aware, it is considered a life worth protecting. Since it may be that even an infant isn't fully self-aware, we could set the line to when the fetus has a sufficiently developed brain. These are all measurable to some extent. These are also both good arguments for when a fetus should be protected because they can be defended rationally.   If a woman miscarries is she wrong to fell like she lost her child.   No. It is a reasonable reaction upon losing a potential life.   Oh, and since when does self-awareness determine life, a man in a coma is still human.   A man in an early coma may regain consciousness. A man who is in a permanent coma is just an empty shell, the only rational argument that could be made for keeping that shell alive is if the brain damage could be repaired feasibly in the future. Otherwise, it is only sentimentality that is making people keep the shell alive.   Edit:   By the way, I'm matter-of-fact about these things because I have no emotional attachment to the subject.

If people are against abortion then they should simply not have abortions but i dont feel its right for people to take the choice away from those that do want them.

That child grows up without love, care, etc and again brings them into a cruel and punishing world with no love or support system also putting them at risk of depression later in life.  It may seem cruel or unfair to abort a child but honestly its far more cruel and unfair to bring a child into a world of poverty, hostility, hatred and other situations and emotions that often surround having an unwanted child.  Starvation was mentioned above,   Whats more cruel aborting a child (no pain or suffering) or having a child that you cant feed that ends up starving to death (which is one of the most excruciating deaths).

However, If that was the main purpose for a woman to get pregnant in the first place, that's a totally different story.   How is it murder? It doesn't even truly exist yet.

"It's not so much killing as denying a chance at life. The argument isn't ""is it ok to kill a newborn"". Abortion involves fetuses and all the ""if it has nails it can feel pain"" hold little sway over the reality of the current world we find ouselves in. Grown people are digging into their own arms between heroin injections.   The argument ""we live in a flower child world of fairytale births that all babies should have an equal chance"" only makes sense when you extract it from reality and explore the idea hypothetically.   - The number of pro-life females would dwindle drastically if they were all raped and impregnated.   - Pro-life arguments ALL rely on the unspoken belief that reincarnation doesnt exist and that the spirit doesn't exist as a world-bound entity, for if the issue was brought up, their arguments would consist of little more than ""a fetus mid-developement shouldn't have to feel pain"".  - Therefore, since the argument consists of little more than pain, consider logically the ramifications of an unwanted child's development, consider poverty stricken children and the realities they endure, but it's all ok right? They didn't have to feel pain before they were born.   Put into the context of our reality, we can't sustain the people we already have, most parents are RETARDED, and children are raising children. That is the reality that pro-lifers are gunning for. There are thousands of children ready to be adopted, there are homeless children that are seduced with food to satisfy pedophile populations, but that's all ok because unborn children shouldn't feel an ounce of pain.  I disagree with many things that pro-choicers spout are arguments since they consist of little more than dilapidated memes stemming from the same faulty logic pro-lifers employ. Yes it's your body but you made a decision to have unprotected sex and since men are required to inseminate, they have a say too. The only logical way a female has the right to deny the male a say is if she upfront told him he has no say in the matters concerning the potential child. But they never say that, why?, because they would die alone. The way I see this debate, one side is blinly screaming ""somebody please think of the children"" and the other side is blindly screaming ""it's my party and I'll cry if I want to"".   Before you devote your lives to ridding the world of fetal pain, deal with the torture that is being carried out uncontested (even though it's often pulbicized=general knowledge), deal with the female genital mutilation, deal with the starving children, deal with the raped children, deal with the unwanted, beaten, emotionally damaged, forgotten, slave children that are a result of poor parental planning you backwards thinking, self-proclaimed advanced specie intellectuals who have nothing better to do than trivialize the pain that exists in this world.

If a mother doesn't want a baby, her first step should be to use birth protection, whether it's a pill, surgery, or condom. If she doesn't use any precaution, then it's her fault for being irresponsible and she should carry the baby to term. Adoption is very successful and if she doesn't want to go through that, then she could always raise the baby anyway. Now if she uses protection in some form, but it fails, then she could always take a morning after pill, like Plan B. Pills like that safely ""miscarry"", for lack of better term, before the egg and sperm become fertilized. Other than that, she has no right to end a life. Sex is a wonderful thing, but people need to realize that it comes with consequences and responsibilities. Teenage girls can't just have sex with whomever and expect abortion to be there every time.

"So pregnancy should serve as a punishment for unsafe sex? That's pretty twisted if you ask me.
",1
"It's not so much punishment as it is a lesson in responsibility. What makes a woman responsible enough to have sex, but not responsible to give birth. If she got an STD from the unprotected sex, she'd have to live with that for the rest of her life and depending on the disease, it could kill her. If she gets pregnant, she can give the baby up for adoption or she could be a responsible woman and raise it on her own or with the help of others.
",0
"Engaging in unsafe sex is irresponsible. Therefore a woman who engages in it should be forced to go through pregnancy in order to get a lesson in responsibility.  Hmm, interesting argument.   There were 123,000 children awaiting adoption as of 2008.  (source)  So really, you're advocating putting unwanted children into foster care, where they will be supported by the American taxpayer.  If abortion were illegal, than the number of children in foster homes would balloon. How much additional funding would we need to divert from other programs to support that many kids? What would the living conditions be like for the children under those circumstances?  And I still think you're advocating pregnancy as punishment. Calling it ""a lesson in responsibility"" is just sugar-coating it to make sound better. And I don't think the punishment fits the crime. Nine months of pregnancy can cause a major disruption in a woman's life. I agree that unsafe sex is irresponsible, but people can be taught responsibility in other ways. We should handle this problem the same way we handle other acts of irresponsibility. Give the offender a fine, for example. Force them to attend safe sex classes. Maybe even have a prison sentence for repeat offenders.  Early term abortion can solve the problem of unwanted children without violating any ethical principles. We should not discard a useful tool.

Give the offender a fine, for example. Force them to attend safe sex classes. Maybe even have a prison sentence for repeat offenders. ""  I kind of like that idea. It's creative and could be efficient. However, the main reason I have always disagreed with you is the because we have different answers for ""When does life begin?"" You believe a human fetus is human at some later point in pregnancy. I believe that it is human life at conception. And that's the main reason we disagree.

"Abortion is invariably the decision of the woman because it is her body whether if the sex was consensual or rape. The government nor the Church has any right telling what a woman should do with her body. Abortion is acceptable because a fetus is not a baby.

"I don't think we disagree over the question of when life begins. What we disagree over is whether it's wrong to kill non-intelligent life. I guess you could argue that a fertilized egg is technically human, if you're willing to stretch the definition of the word, but it is certainly not intelligent. You never have given me a good answer for why it's wrong to destroy non-intelligent life.
",1
"Because it's wrong to destroy  innocent  human life regardless of intelligence. If you're saying it's perfectly fine to kill non-intelligent human life, then where is the cut off? Comatose patients? The mentally handicapped? I'm going to guess you'd cut the line just after the comatose (making euthanasia moral), but even then, it's  human life , which I believe is worth saving, not losing.
",0
"Yes, but  why ? In your post on my ""Why is killing wrong?"" debate, you said killing is wrong because it damages the group and because it causes pain. Neither of those apply when killing non-intelligent life.  As for where we draw the line, for the purposes of this debate, let's draw it at any non-zero intelligence. That is, if there's any intellectual capacity at all, killing the person is wrong. So killing a week-old clump of cells is ok, killing somebody who is completely brain-dead is ok, killing anybody else is not ok.
",1
"You do make a valid point there, but I feel like the ""pain"" involved could be considered spiritual pain or even emotional pain to the mother. I believe we all have souls, completely independent of religion. And at conception, that little tiny zygote has a soul. Our souls define who we are and I think it's immoral to destroy a life with an innocent soul. In the other debate I only really mention the adverse effects of killing in a physical sense. That;s because when I think of the word kill, I immediately think of murdering an adult and I suppose those reasons are the reasons why many animals do not kill their own species.  Besides, aborting a baby at any stage is not acceptable, by my standards, because the mother (or whomever decided to abort) is not giving that baby a chance at life. Who knows whether or not that baby could have become the next Albert Einstein or the next Adolf Hitler.   All I know is that it does cause pain. I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting. Is that not pain? And if you think about it, it does damage the population. With the populations we have, each abortion does not have a huge impact, but each one takes away a genetically unique individual. This decreases genetic variation in the gene pool.
",0
"""I believe we all have souls, completely independent of religion.""   Oh, come on. How could you possibly say that without bringing religion into the debate?   ""I've heard stories of many women stating how they felt terrible about themselves after aborting.""   We've been over this. The regret could come from not having a kid when she had the chance. But that's no reason to ban abortion. The regret could come from going against the Christian values she was raised with. But again, that's no reason to ban abortion. There are many women who get abortions and feel no regret whatsoever.   ""With the populations we have, each abortion does not have a huge impact, but each one takes away a genetically unique individual.""   Heh. By that logic, women should be required to pump out as many kids as possible.

"Uh no. It is murder whither you believe it or not.  Check out what I said in the OTHER Abortion debate...I don't feel like re-posting that.   Hate debating this subject because, everyone is just a materialist about it.
",0
"I do not see it as acceptable except in extreme health cases. The reason for this is that a fetus is a human life form, and abortion is either murder or stopping a human life from becoming fully developed into a person. I'm not saying it's not a difficult issue, or that other viewpoints are invalid, of course. It's just the way I see it, and it makes sense to me logically. Is even the case of rape a reason to kill a human life? Perhaps, if it is before the fetus gains a consciousness. But if you are killing a conscious human being, I can't see even the case of rape justifying that.   Now, I do not know at what point during pregnancy, or after, a child/fetus has consciousness. If anyone knows this(and can back it up with a reliable source), by all means, tell me. I'm not saying that the knowledge(even if it says the fetus does not have consciousness) would definitely change my viewpoint, but it could.  At any rate, I don't think that abortion without good reason would be okay, because whether or not a fetus is a person, it is a developing human life.   So...go on. Tear me apart. But be nice, 'cause tomorrow's my birthday. x)

"This question has far greater implications. Are there such things as inalienable rights - human rights? The right to life for example? If there are, then there are two possibilites:  1. Humans obtain their inalienable rights purely by being a human being. From the moment of conception, a distinct human being, with its own unique genetic signature, has been given rise - thus from the moment of conception a human being starts to exist and as such, with conception the inalienable rights are also given to the human merely for existing as a human being.  2. We start bartering and haggling. When does a human get rights, what rights, which humans should get them etc etc. But if we conclude with this option, then there is no real reason to limit ourselves to the unborn - Nazi Germany is a very modern example of a nation haggling with these inalienable rights on born human beings.  So first of all, we need to see what implications rise from the views and ideas to which we have attached ourselves to.  Now that you've thought about these implications, lets look at abortion from an honest perspective - it's the termination of the life of a developing human being for the sake of perserving the convenience and the satisfaction of another person. This is against all reason. Convenience does not justify the termination of another human's life - murder.  The parents are generally always responsible for the creation of the fetus, so they should have the moral obligation to support the life of that fetus. If they do not want the child, they can give him/her up for adoption - adoption is not some myth. We must also strive for the creation of institutions that would take care of unwanted children in a loving, productive environment. Murder is not an acceptable alternative for a civilized nation.  Given the fact that pregnancy lasts 9 months, one needs to ask themselves - Is murder justified by temporary inconvenience?  For the sake of comparison, think of the USA, 1800 - the question of slavery. Some of you may object, but the general rethoric at the time was completely the same - Blacks are not fully human, thus they have no rights ; We should not force our opinions on other people, lets respect our freedom to choose ; We are not ready for such an extensive protection of human rights, we need to go step by step etc etc.   Nowaydays we laugh and ridicule such arguments as we see it self-evidently that slavery is immoral and I'm convinced that 100 years from now, we'll be seeing abortion in the same light.  As abortion does not affirm to my vision of what an ethical, civilized nation should be like - I'm forced to subscribe to the pro-life position.

"I'm kinda in the middle.  I don't think raped women should be forced to have their babies, if they get pregnant.  And also, I think we should prioritize the mother instead of the child. If the mothers life is in danger if she has the baby, I think she should abort the baby.

I'll admit it's silly for them to call themselves pro-life when they are not, but they're still being smart to try and go for a middle man. It's not necessarily their fault culture requires that they pick a side.  Being neutral can be hard.   Why the double standard and inconsistency?   I'm not saying it's perfect. If you start with a flawed, rigid, one-sided position you're likely to not get much of anywhere. That's why I will never label myself pro-life or pro-choice, honestly.

"A women should be able to choose what happens with her body, especially concerning abortion and babies.  Not because I support abortion, but what if you were the child of a mom?  What if that mom only had you grudgingly because she was forced to have you, abortions being outlawed?  Would you really want to grow up unloved? A child who's own mother would have aborted you?   Worse than an accident, you are a person whom the people you are supposed to love, and are supposed to love you would rather have had you dead than given birth to you.  In reality, it's not that bad, but forcing a mother to give birth to an unwanted child is cruel, and with the human population this high, with plenty of orphans already, why make more? Why go to the trouble and the pain for the mother, and the child, the entire family, and the whole world, when abortion could be an option?  I support safe sex and planned pregnancy, I think abortion is murder, as is war or any human killing another human, but killing does happen.

"Well, I think very grey here.  The deal is that at the end of the day, if you had an abortion, well you just killed a future human being. It doesn't matter when conception is or when YOU think that baby actually turned into a real human being. You just killed a life, a future.   So yes, at the end of the day... Abortion is essentially murder.   However, I think that under any circumstance, a woman should be able to abort her own baby. A woman has her right to her body, it is going to be her pain and her blood and tears going into this young's life. If a woman strongly believes that she isn't prepared for parenthood then she has the right to her own body.   It is also the right to her mind. Abortion is not easy, just like any type of surgery it leaves scars. Not only the physical ones but also the mental ones. Women have to deal with the thought of the murder of their own child for the rest of her life. She has to think of the suffering of that child and the pain of her child... That was never even born.   Abortion is also risky, woman and their... Umm...... ""companions""/companion..... Should talk over the risks of the surgery and the abortion itself.

"Does it not go against all reason that person A should have the right to kill person B, if person A finds person B's continued existence to be inconvenient?  A woman may have a right to her body, but by choosing abortion she's affecting the rights of another persons body as well - the child's.   And mental trauma from the abortion is no fitting punishment for murder. We don't let people freely walk away from unwillingly killing other people just because they feel bad about it.

Daughters of teen moms are 22% more likely to become teen moms than their peers. Sons of teen moms are 13% more likely to go to prison than their peers. Not to mention the impact on the teen moms themselves. Less than 35% of teen moms finish high school, and only 1.5% of teen moms get there degree by age 30.

Let me remind you that the title of this argument "" Abortion should be Banned"". Thats a straight forward yes or no question and since there are "" what if's"" (what if it is rape, what if it's an aciddent , ect.) in this situation the conclusion is that Abortions should'nt be banned.

"[*I'm not homosexual but I do agree.]  Why shouldn't they? Gays also have feelings to each other. They're also same human-beings like us but only the fact that they are homosexual. That doesn't mean that Gays should not get married.   Loving each other can lead to marriage and that's normal. What's peculiar is that they both are homosexual ""ONLY"".   But, they should also have those kind of things where we register(?) ourselves as a married couple in law so that they have that feeling of being responsible for what they are doing, that is, marriage. Marriage is something that people should be carefully concerned with, and the same goes for Gay couples too!  They should be responsible and must think of what their 'adopted' child (if they're going to have one) might think of their parents too. Because, all these are something very crucial.

Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with each other   I don't find what you stated as a dispute. If it was intended to be one. if it was intended to be a dispute then you are wrong because when i stated ""growing in numbers"" i didn't meant adoption. I meant producing children into this world.   In one small sense, it is wrong to be homosexuals because you can't produce children. In that sense, it is naturally wrong. In another sense, it is right to be homosexuals because you can stop overpopulation. These are two contradicting statements showed by ReventonRage and RiceD. However, these statements are truthful in their own perspective. I understand that homosexuals can't have kids. They can adopt children and thus, support the advancement of the human race. Homosexuals, like non-homosexuals, can become scientists and mathmaticians that supports the advancment of the human race. Im just providing more senses in which being a homosexual is right.   You know what? I proved that facts can be contradicting. Homosexuals can't produce children and in that sense, it is wrong. However, they stop the world from overpopulation. In that sense, it is right. I know those statements are contradicting but i can't deny that both of them are correct in their own little perspectives.  Edit. If you read my other comments then you will already know that i think i went a little off topic with mine. I thought marriage meant having children so that is why i went into the discussion of children. Therefore, the discussion of children lead me to the purpose of life. If the author of this debate didn't meant marriage as in having children afterwards, then my comment should be dismissed. Ignored but not forgotten. lol.   It is contradicting. Im surprised myself. I said that a lot. However, i can say the same for non-homosexual people as well. They support life and they don't support life. Im just saying this so you don't imply that i don't think this.

"It is not wrong to get ""married."" However, in that logic and mind, it is wrong to live in a perspective of not producing children when overpopulation isn't met. It is ""naturally wrong"" to have an infertile body when you can't produce an offspring...in one sense. In stated this sense in my first argument.   When i created my first argument, the thought of marriage didn't come to mind. I understand that is weird because that word is in the title of this debate. And i find it weird. I replied supportingly, but not one hundred percent supportingly, that men and women should be attracted to each other. I comment that i supported is that of Shadowwolf when he stated that men and women should fall in love. In response, ignorantly percieved that comment as that men and women should be attracted to one another.   I provided senses in which this attraction is right and wrong.  Edit. I now believe that my comment was a little off topic. When i think of marriage, i think of children. However, if the thought of children wasn't implied by the author, my comment should be dismissed.

"Wow. A contradictory statement within the same breath? What do you mean when you say ""homosexuals are not wrong""?   It is contradicting. However, my argument still stands correct. Before i go ahead, this is all opinionated and this is what i believe is the ""truth.""   I thought it was clear when i stated that homosexuals are not wrong. What i meant was, in a simple perspective, that being a homosexual stops the advancement of human growth and advancement. This perspective is not being able to produce children.  The truth is contradicting. Evidence that supports the previous sentence is the fact that homosexuals stops the world from overpopulation. This is another perspective that makes being a homosexual naturally right. This evidence supports advancement of growth by controlling growth. That too sounds contradicting but if we overpopulated, then it may be hard to sustain life. If we can't sustain life, then we can't advance the growth of humans. Now, i am not too educated in all the problems that may happen due to overpopulation. However, i do think it is bad to use up most of earth's resources. We need earth's resources to sustain life.    Knowledge is simply belief on the basis of strong/over-whelming evidence. To say that you ""believe"" in anything in a debate amounts to saying nothing at all!   I understand what you are saying. However, you implied wrong. I believe that is this knowledge/truth because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument:   1. Fearing the tip blade touching our heart because we don't want to die. (lol i said blame)?   2. We go to school to better ourselves.   3. Not wasting my life playing on my Nintendo Wii if i had a billion dollars.   I believe morality plays a part of evidence that supports the purpose of life (I can be wrong about this) :  1. Killing one or multiple people of your own race, human race, is wrong. Why do we hate or cringe our face at the thought of killing one of our own? I believe (but i think it is face on some levels) that it is wrong because killing your own kind is against the purpose of life.   However, this is contradictory. This is contradictory because we had World War 1 and World War 2. We kill our own kind in that race. However, i think that the truth can be contradictory. We had to fight in World War 1 and World War 2 to sustain America's advancement of growth.......I not to intelligent in history. However, i believe one of the main reason to fight in war is to not let other people control us. Excuse me and correct me if I'm wrong.    How are any of these analogies related to whether homosexuals should or should not get married?   hmmm. I stated this before in another person's comment but i believe i went off topic with my entire comment. When shadowwolf stated that men and women should fall in love, i took it as that men and women should be attracted to one another. That is why i went into the discussion of children and the purpose of life. I went into that discussion because the purpose of life is supported when men and women have children. If the author of this debate didn't imply ""producing children"" to ""married"" then my argument should be dismissed entirely due to the fact that i went off topic.   I'm not realizing this mistake.

"It is contradicting. However, my argument still stands correct.   A contradictory statement cannot make a valid argument.

And the probability of it being truth is high. There is no guareentee that it is truth. I believe in God but that isn't knowledge.   But im frustrated why would you discuss this again when i had proven with examples that my belief is somewhat knowledgable. I gave examples.    Do you even know what ""overpopulation"" means?    lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    I don't see how your analogies relate to homosexuality   I went a little off topic with my comment. I was trying to prove with these anologies the purpose of life. It relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life. And like i said above, i will prove that again.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---   Two contradictory statements:   Homosexuals does not support the purpose of life by not producing children    Homosexuality do support the purpose of life by stopping overpopulation   However, they are both correct.   The purpose of life to advance as humans. One way to advance as humans is to grow in numbers.   Scenario 1. If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Scenario 2. If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   When i say homosexuality is wrong and right. I don't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right. They share a right and wrong like non-homosexual people; like any normal person.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both ""right"" AND ""wrong"" at the same time. If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment. Though, i don't really know about that if taking down Hitler would stop the Jewish people from suffering. There were many factors that led to their safety.   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person. If i killed that rapists, i killed a person. I am thus, wrong. However, i am also right for saving a life.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy."" I think that acts like a Homosexuality Act where couples can't produce more than one child. I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities. The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples. (source: wikipedia).    http://www.prb.org/Articles/2006/ ChinasConcernOverPopulationAgingandHeal th.aspx    The link i provide is interesting because this show that China is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people.

Are you that stupid? Believe is  never  knowledge. And therefore, your examples are cases of false analogies.   lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    WRONG . Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area. I'm a Geography scholar, see. So don't try and pull any stunts with Geographical terminology with me ;)   t relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life.   Which is a contradiction. Gosh, you're really not that intelligent are you?   If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only  female  homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.   Response to premise 1 :  First, why does it have to be only  female  homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it."" So, while homosexuality might not increase the  population size , this has no bearing on whether  society  will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Response to premise 2 :  It is a hasty generalisation to say that  all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   I have no quarrel with your argument here except for the last part. There is no conclusive evidence to show that with homosexuality, overpopulation will not occur. As I have shown, your definition of overpopulation is flawed. Again I repeat, I am well learned in Geography and demography, so don't fuck around with definitions and pretend to be knowledgeable in front of me. We can have homosexuality, but if each couple still gives birth to 20 children, overpopulation  might  still occur. Furthermore, it  DOES NOT  mean that if we allow homosexuals to marry, then everyone will turn homosexual. There still  will  be heterosexuals and in fact, there won't be any change as to the number of heterosexuals since homosexuals will probably not marry someone of the opposite gender anyway.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both ""right"" AND ""wrong"" at the same time.   I have shown that both your arguments are fallacious. You are wrong on both arguments at the same time.   If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment.   You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of  most  of the suffering of the Jewish people?   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person.   A rapist cannot  try  to rape a person. He has  already  rape d  a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   However, i am also right for saving a life.   Committing murder is  not  a characteristic of rapists.   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the ""one child policy.""   The One Child policy was introduced due to an abnormally high rate of population growth after the era of Mao Zedong, who preached that with more people there will be greater economic progress. The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it  might  or might  not  be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China  relative  to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities.   Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples.   Wrong. That is only after the revision of the Policy. The original policy only said all couples were allowed to have one child. Did you know that there were on average 33  forced  abortions a day at the peak of the enforcement of the One Child policy? Please don't talk about things you don't know. You'll only make a fool of yourself.

"You can't make a valued judgement on whether something is true or not if you have no evidence    I did proposed evidence: Books and morality.   And i do get it. Why am i wrong when i said that belief may be truth or may not be truth backed with no strong evidence to support it? Knowledge is knowledge whether or not if it backed up with evidence or not. You don't need to prove knowledge with evidence because knowledge is already proven by existence.    Believe is never knowledge   That is true. Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact. However, why say it when what you believe in turns out to be knowledge after all.    WRONG. Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area.   How was i wrong when i stated ""too much people to carry?"" Or when i stated when ""the amount of people exceed the normal amount?"" I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.    First, why does it have to be only female homosexuals?  Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter. And it is not only female homosexuals; it is mostly female homosexuals.    Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it.""   You are right. However, without people, there isn't a society in existence. So that is why i interpret society as the population. But next time as i write, i will remind myself, hopefully, of the difference.     So, while homosexuality might not increase the population size, this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Society cannot grow independently of population. Didn't you state that society refers to the ""association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship?"" Without people, there isn't a society. That is like saying a house with no family has family rules. And i mean of a house that never had a family in the first place.    It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.    There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism. And others that i already suggested. I don't think it is a hasty remark. An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed. But then again, maybe everything in the book was all done for ""fun.""   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality. I had stated, maybe not to you, that homosexuality can become mathmaticians and scientists. Those are clearly two professions that can develop a society into a growing society. And homosexuals can adopt children.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law. So i can fairly say put society and its population in the same hand. However, these two are not exactly the same.    And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   You didn't prove that my both scenarios are untrue. In the first scenario, you stated a question that has no effect on the changing of the scenario. Second, you made a difference to population and society but that doesn't make my scenario fallacious. They are a dinstinction but not a total one. I say to you to go into a forest and start a family with two homosexual women and two homosexual men. And in this scenario, you cannot adopt children. Can you think you can grow as a society? No, unless the women are allowing the men to impregnate themselves.    You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of most of the suffering of the Jewish people?   Im wrong for taking Hitler's life because that is against morality itself. Morality doesn't want me to kill another one of my kind. Morality's best evidence is viewed within oneself. Hitler isn't the cause of the most suffering of the Jewish people. However, thanks to him and the Nazis, the Jews were sent to the concentration camps. Of course, there are many causes. Evidence: well the best evidence i can give is wikipedia.    A rapist cannot try to rape a person. He has already raped a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   I should has said ""serial rapists."" But lol of course a rapist can try to rape. If a man rapes, he is known as a rapist. If that man against tries to rape, then it is a rapist trying to rape. I honestly believe your statement was silly to make. And your statement doesn't make my argument fallacious.    The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it might or might not be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China relative to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   As stated by wikipedia, the policy came to be to control the population. I don't have the exact quotes from China's officials but it is obvious that the overpopulation was feared. Now in March 2011, the Chinese goverment is allowing its citizens to have a second couple. That is a contradiction to the original policy but it is still truthful. Again, my source is wikipedia.    Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   If you can't find the similiarities between the policy and homosexuality, i ask you, what are you smoking? But i don't want to assume you are a smoker. I think that is rude.   Overall, you didn't prove my two scenarios are fallacious.  Edit. This is a contradiction. In some sense i can see society exist without its people. I see it if i think of it as a concept. However, i don't see it in another light. In this light when all society's people die, i see society vanishing because there is no one to support it. True contradictions. Tho not all contradictions are true.

"Why am i wrong when i said that belief may be truth or may not be truth backed with no strong evidence to support it? Knowledge is knowledge whether or not if it backed up with evidence or not.   This is  EXACTLY  where you are wrong. Are you so dense and stupid that you can't understand simple English? If you can't, then it would be beneath me to honour you with a reply, which I have been doing for a long time and my patience is wearing thin. Knowledge is what philosophers term as  ""justified true belief"" . What this means is that to be considered ""knowledge"", a belief must be  both  justified and true. If you can't understand this, then you are truly stupid.   Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact.   Wrong. See above.   How was i wrong when i stated ""too much people to carry?""   You're wrong. ""Too many"" with respect to what? Be specific.   Or when i stated when ""the amount of people exceed the normal amount?""   What is the ""normal""? Be specific.   I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.   As long as you are not specific, you are wrong with the definition. That is the idea of ""defining"".   Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter.   Contrary to your warped  belief , it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   it is mostly female homosexuals.   First, that is  not  what you have said. Second, prove that it is "" mostly  female homosexuals""? Finally,  so what  if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter  all  three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   However, without people, there isn't a society in existence.   This debate isn't about  propogating  homosexuality, it  is  about acceptance. I am not saying that homosexuality should be promoted. What I am saying is that they should be accepted. Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   Society cannot grow independently of population.   Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism.   What you said is that   "" all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow""  . Imperialism only occurs with  some societies ,  NOT  all societies.   An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed.   Yes, but not ""conquer and grow"".   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality.   Which is contradictory to what you have said.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law.   Just to side track, I think my definition from the OED is more credible than any definition from the Internet ;)   You didn't prove that my both scenarios are untrue.   I did. Until you reply my criticisms, I will not honour you with a rebuttal.

"This is EXACTLY where you are wrong.   No i am not wrong. lol. Here is my argument and it may differ with what i stated previously (don't forget my thinking changes)  In one sense, belief is knowledge if it is knowledge. If i hadn't have any clue about the earth's revolution around the sun and stated ""i believe the earth revolved around the sun"" and found out later is was knowledge, then belief is knowledge.   Belief is an opinon that may or may not be true. Knowledge is truth.    You're wrong. ""Too many"" with respect to what? Be specific.   Too many people to carry. Overpopulation means when population exceeds the normal amount.    Contrary to your warped belief, it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   Im not whining. Your question was irrevalent. Why? Because whether or not i answer you doesn't change the scenario.    First, that is not what you have said. Second, prove that it is ""mostly female homosexuals""? Finally, so what if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter all three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   Yes, that is what is stated. I stated "" If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that..."" What do you mean to prove that it is mostly female homosexuals? Prove that how i stated that??? Because if not, that is another irrevelant question. So what if it is mostly female homosexuals...because i stated so. It is a scenario. I created it.   Questions cannot change the scenario. It is what it is.    Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   I had never implied that so your entire arguement about this fails.    Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   The term population doesn't really mean blooming in size. When i say population, i simply mean people. Take the people out the equation, do you have a society still? Without no eskimos, there is no society. And i didn't know that eskimos have a rich society and culture. Cool.     Yes, but not ""conquer and grow"".   ""Grow"" as in succeeding.   Not all societies conquer. I was wrong to imply all.    Which is contradictory to what you have said.   In some ways societies can grow with homosexuals. In some ways, they can't.    I did. Until you reply my criticisms, I will not honour you with a rebuttal.   You really didn't disprove my scenarios as proof that homosexuality helps societies and does not help societies.   In ways they do help, and in way they don't. Im not saying that homosexuals are completely helping socities or not completely helping societies.

"Here is my argument and it may differ with what i stated previously (don't forget my thinking changes)   If your thinking has changed, you're admitting that you are wrong, as I have shown. My thinking is iron clad and my position has not wavered throughout the debate. Your thinking on the other hand seems to be arbitrary. Thus, it seems like either you are too stupid to cling on to a position or that you have been proven wrong.   belief is knowledge if it is knowledge   Which obviously makes no sense as a statement  at all  since it is merely begging the question. And thus, whatever you say subsequently on this statement is fallacious.   Belief is an opinon that may or may not be true.   Wrong. It is an opinion that  has not been proven  to be true or false.   Knowledge is truth.   Wrong. Knowledge is  justified true belief . It is not merely that it is true. It is also justified. To be considered knowledge, a belief  must  fulfill three conditions:  1. The statement must be a statement of ""belief"".  2. The statement must be a statement of ""belief""  that is true .  3. The statement must be a statement of ""belief""   that has been proven   that  that is true .   Overpopulation means when population exceeds the normal amount.   Wrong. It doesn't matter that it exceeds ""the normal amount"". Population growth exceeds ""the normal amount"" but it doesn't mean that just because the population is growing, there  is  overpopulation. Population growth  might lead to  overpopulation, but it doesn't necessarily result in overpopulation  immediately . Overpopulation occurs when the population grows and exceeds the carrying capacity of an area such that it results in a fall in standard of living. If you can't understand that, either you have the IQ of an amoeba or you're too arrogant to admit that you're wrong. I  know  that I am not wrong because as a Geography scholar, I have studied population geography for a whole year and know my definitions well.  Gosh, you don't seem to be too smart. Check the dictionary if you need to.   Because whether or not i answer you doesn't change the scenario.   Which doesn't make it wrong. You still haven't shown why my criticisms of your argument as unjustified. Thus, your scenario is a false one.   Im not whining.   And yes, you are whining. You arguments aren't iron clad. In fact, it is a sieve with huge holes. More accurately, it is like a tower of cards that falls at the slightest challenge.   What do you mean to prove that it is mostly female homosexuals?   Since you  claimed  that it is ""mostly female homosexuals"", then justify your claim. Simple as that. Can't you understand simple English, idiot?   It is a scenario. I created it.   Yeah, I get that, moron. I have shown that it is a  FALSE ANALOGY  and you haven't disputed me.   Questions cannot change the scenario. It is what it is.   I don't want to change the scenario, stupid. I am showing why it is wrong.   I had never implied that so your entire arguement about this fails.   Yes you have so my argument holds true.   The term population doesn't really mean blooming in size.   I didn't say that. I said that population  growth  means blooming in size. Learn to read will you? What a prick.   When i say population, i simply mean people.   Which is ontologically wrong.   And i didn't know that eskimos have a rich society and culture.   Since you're an ignoramus, I didn't expect you to.   Not all societies conquer. I was wrong to imply all.    DUH...    In some ways societies can grow with homosexuals. In some ways, they can't.   Which has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry or not. Thus, such a statement is not only a contradiction to what you have previously said, it is also a red herring.

"Which obviously makes no sense as a statement at all since it is merely begging the question. And thus, whatever you say subsequently on this statement is fallacious.   lol it totally makes sense. Knowledge isn't something that pops up. It already exists in this earth. If what you believe is the actual truth, then your belief is truth. By definiton, belief and knowledge differs. By mental thinking alone, belief and knowledge is the same when belief is knowledge.    Wrong. It is an opinion that has not been proven to be true or false.   By definition alone, yes. By mental thinking, no. Think about it. Beliefs MAY be true or false.    Wrong. It doesn't matter that it exceeds ""the normal amount"".

I am showing why it is wrong.   I know that you don't want to change the scenario. And you are not showing how it is wrong. That is illogical speaking because simply that doesn't make sense. I created a scenario of a society with mostly homosexual females. Simply trying to prove it is wrong doesn't even make logical sense.    Yeah, I get that, moron. I have shown that it is a FALSE ANALOGY and you haven't disputed me.   I haven't disputed you because you haven't disputed me. You didn't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial (in scenario 2) and not beneficial (in scenario 1).    Which is ontologically wrong.   I don't what you mean that it is ontologically wrong. In one sense, the population is the people. In another sense, the population is the number of people.    Which has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry or not. Thus, such a statement is not only a contradiction to what you have previously said, it is also a red herring.  Again, until your reply my criticisms, this debate is over.   Now you are being ignorant. My argument is soley about not marriage, but whether or not homosexuality is right and/or wrong. I told two or three times that i went into this discussion because i implied marriage as producing children and that is why i went into the purpose of life. The reason why i still went into this discussion is because you are still replying me.   I replied to your criticism. I remember asking you countless questions that you never answered. And you haven't disprove my scenarios.   A society with mostly homosexuals can be beneficial or not. It depends. If society wants to continue for centuries, homosexuals need to bear children. Im ignoring the fact that you can adopt children.   If society is fearing overpopulation, homosexuals is beneficials by controlling the overpopulation rate. They are not the only source to stop population. They are just one way.   Im appalled that you don't even get this. And its annoying.

I can gather up more than a few homosexuals and a few non homosexuals, put them in a house, and make an experiment out of it. People can say that the scenario is pointless because it never has occured in society before. And i say bravo because that proves that homosexuality is wrong in that sense.   I never admitted that the scenario was pointless. I said your questions was pointless.    I don't accept lies, false accusations and irrationality.   How was my scenario a lie? How was my scenario false accusation? How was my scenario irrational? Oh, Thank you. You admitted that my scenario was irrational. Irrational is a term that means illogical or NOT REASONABLE.

I have never argued based on emotion. You're putting words in my mouth again.   Nope. I am not putting words in your mouth. You did state that emotion can't be used as a logical argument. It would be best for me to show you the argument that you stated those words, but that seems difficult. Why? I don't remember the argument and i forgot the debate. I may look it up.    In epistemology, there is no difference between the discovery of knowledge and the creation of knowledge.   Yeah i agree. There is no difference between the two in Physics either.

Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals. I haven't read of any society that composed of mostly female homosexuals in history books. It is a thinking scenario. A ""what if"" scenario.   Like this one other debator, i am simply proposing variables.   And this about it, how can a society survive with mostly female homosexuals? No children is ever going to be produced. This is common sense. Yes, they can adopt children but im ignoring that. Why? Because my scenario starts from the very beginning with just a few men and mostly female homosexuals.    You are wrong. Something cannot be both ""right"" and ""wrong"" at the same time. That is a contradiction.   You have to look at what im saying in the view that im saying. There are many views to look at. If i killed a rapist, in one view the death is a good thing because the rapist isn't going to harm anyone anymore. In another view, i am wrong because this death goes against my morality. I can't prove morality but morality exists. And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   And im not saying that they are completely wrong and completely right. They ""share"" a side of wrong and a side of right. Everybody can be right and wrong at the same time. You have to look at it one view at a time.    Hey idiot, you did mean to disrespect me. And by the way, you are thick headed. And I mean that with the utmost disrespect to you.   No, i didn't mean to disrespect you. I called you thick headed because you still question to say that my words are irrelevant to the debate as if we haven't discussed about it. That makes you an idiot too, in this view. And still, you say that my words are irrelevant to the debate. I told you, that it is irrelevant because i simply wanted to continue this argument. So why still ask it? Either you are thick headed and/or you are and idiot.   So really, i didn't mean to disrespect you. Im simply stating the truth i perceive.  Edit.

Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals.   You really enjoy putting words in others' mouths, don't you? I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the  need  for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.   Like this one other debator, i am simply proposing variables.   There is no problem with proposing variables  as long as you can JUSTIFY the need for proposing the variables . If you can't, you'll just be violating Occam's razor.   No children is ever going to be produced.   Really?   If i killed a rapist, in one view the death is a good thing because the rapist isn't going to harm anyone anymore.   No, it is never a good thing to kill anyone, even if that person is a rapist. In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I can't prove morality but morality exists.   If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart.   And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   My morality even forbids me from killing species of animals  other than my own kind .   Everybody can be right and wrong at the same time.   No, they can't. That is still a contradiction.   you still question to say that my words are irrelevant to the debate   I said ""irrelevant to the debate"", not ""irrelevant to our discussion"". Learn to read will you, idiot?   So really, i didn't mean to disrespect you. Im simply stating the truth i perceive.   These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Then why did you ""argued"" that i treated your criticism as a joke because i laughed.    That is  not  an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, ""Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad."" Such an argument is fallacious.

"No matter how little or how much, you are still guilty.   I really don't care.    Yes you are. I repeat, ""I have never argued based on emotion."" Get that through to your thick skull, idiot, and then come and rebut me.   You are clearly lying. You stated that i treat your criticisms as a joke because i laughed. Therefore, you argued based off ""my""  emotion. You did stated that emotion isn't a logical argument. And i never said you argued off of your emotion. But you argued on my emotion; hence, you argued off of emotion.    But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   No. I said that knowledge isn't ""always"" discovered, it is created as well. Im not stating that there isn't never a difference between knowledge discovered and knowledge created. In some examples, there is a difference. In some examples, they are the same.    I won't respond because you haven't answered my criticism that your statement was begging the question.   lol i don't even know how my words ""beg the question."" I don't understand what you fully mean.    I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the need for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.   Sigh. How else can i justify my assumption without evidence? Justify means ""show or prove to be right or reasonable"" as stated by google. Evidence seems like the best way to justify in my perception.    Really?   Unless those straight guys are going to rape those homosexual ladies, i don't ever see those ladies ever producing children. And you know what rape leads to...mental problems. And that isn't good for a society.    No, it is never a good thing to kill anyone, even if that person is a rapist. In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I would have to disagree with you on that. Why is it never a good thing? In some perspectives, i see it as a good thing if that person isn't harming another soul.    If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart   Morality exists. In order to fully justify it, i have to do a experiment with millions of people.    These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Can we please not get into this. I know that i didn't intend to disrespect you because i am me. You have no say because you are not me.    That is not an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, ""Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad."" Such an argument is fallacious.   I know what you are stating. I know the view that you are looking at this from. However, you did argue off of emotion. If you want to be specific, you should had stated that you don't argue off of my emotion. ""My"" as in ""you.""

"You didn't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial (in scenario 2) and not beneficial (in scenario 1).   I have shown your scenarios to be wrong.   [Taken from my previous comment]   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only female homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.  Response to premise 1:  First, why does it have to be only female homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing ""society"" and ""population"". According to the OED, ""society"" refers to ""Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship."" On the other hand, ""population"" refers to ""A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it."" So, while homosexuality might not increase the population size, this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.  Response to premise 2:  It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.
",1
"No, this doesn't prove the scenario wrong.   Why does it have to be only female homosexuals? I stated that it is mostly female homosexuals. The scenario is filled with mostly homosexuals because well:   1. That is my scenario and i created it.   2. It is going to prove WHY homosexuality is right.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------   By legal definition, there is a small gap between society and population. However, i am putting them in the same category because the gap is small. According to google definition, the term society means the aggregate of people living together in a small or less ordered community. If people wasn't in a society, hence society will not exist because  1. People create society.   2. The term people is in the definition of society.   You stated: ""According to the OED, ""society"" refers to the 'Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship.'"" Without man, this association or society won't even exist. If man died, who is going to continue this association or companionship? Nobody would. Hence, no population means no society.   You stated: ""Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesivness and tolerance..."" First, that is a contradiction. You stated that a society is the association with one's fellow men. So how can it grow independently without man?   I am going give you a task. Build a house and don't allow no family to move in. Nobody is to ever live in that house after it is built. Is that house going to somehow, out of the blue, create family rules or laws? People create society. Society doesn't create itself.   You stated: ""It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow."" I agree that i can't say all societies have that desire. However, you see many times in history books the desire to be free, to work, to live, etc. Im not a historian with all the history classes i took, there were many times when mankind ""didn't want to stop."" They want to continue and grow through science, and technology. So i don't think it is a hasty generalisation. And when i stated ""conquer"" i didn't just mean violence. I also meant growth through science, technology, etc. That was my fault for not being specific.    And therefore, since both of your premises are not true   You haven't proven that it is not true.

"In a sense, homosexuals are NOT WRONG because they stop the world from overpopulation.   Wow, this sentence just reduced an entire demographic of living, loving normal human beings to a single function outside of which they have no purpose.   it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers   Besides the apparent contradiction with the fist sentence already pointed out by ReventonRage, this shows a lack of open mindedness on your part in suffering from the same issue as the first statement albeit from the opposite perspective.   Therefore, i believe, MOST men and women must be attracted to each other to inorder to grow and advane as a human race.   This is quite insulting to homosexuals, look at your fist statement, you are contradicting yourself again.

"Ah, yes. ReventonRage did pointed out a contradiction. However, both of you and him is forgetting the point. The point is that in one perspective or sense, it is wrong to be a homosexual. And in another sense, it is right to be a homosexual. I gave the reason why.   The truth can be contradicting but it doesn't mean that it isn't the truth.  I believe another point that you two are forgetting that there is a right and a wrong to every side. Being a homosexual is naturally right and wrong. Being a non-homosexual (straight male and female) can be both right and wrong.   Wow, this sentence just reduced an entire demographic of living, loving normal human beings to a single function outside of which they have no purpose.   This is one sense in which being a homosexual is right. You must had implied that i implied that this is the only way that they are right. No. Another way to advance as humans is education. Homosexuals can become teacher, scientists, mathmaticians, etc. I didn't pointed it out because i wanted to provide a short but simple comment to Apollo.    This is quite insulting to homosexuals, look at your fist statement, you are contradicting yourself again.   I should been more clearer. In many senses, a non-homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race. A homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race.   It is contradicting but this is still the truth.  Edit. Homosexuals are wrong because they stop the world from populating. Homosexuals are right because they stop overpopulation. Those are two contradicting but truthful statements. In a ""sense"" if one person can't produce an offspring, he or she is opposing the purpose of life in ONE WAY. In another ways, he or she can support it. Hence people can be both right and wrong. Not producing an offsprings opposes the purpose of life by not increasing your own race in numbers.   In another sense, they are right for not increasing the numbers of their own race. Contradicting but true. Why? Overpopulation is the answer. Overpopulation can decrease the advancement of growth because if we use all of earth's resources, life would be hard to sustain. Now im not educated in the dangers that overpopulation can propose. If they propose no danger or if the danger i presented is incorrect, then please correct me....if you want to, of course. :D

Homosexuals are trying to make hetreosexual things their's i.e. marriage.   Marriage between heterosexual couples is performed as both a religious and a legal ceremony, Gay couples do not get married in a religious ceremony so why would it bother you?

I could go on forever.. but none of the cultures allowed gay marriage.    Not many had open gay relations   So homosexuality isn't immoral since time immemorial, glad to see you agree on that.  In ancient Greece the male form was considered the ideal of beauty and the ancient Romans were fond of rampant homosexuality. If there was no gay marriage then I don't see how it impacts now, do we still have gladiatorial events where people are killed for amusement, NO. Do we still have widespread slavery, NO. Do we still have a view of women as second class citizens, NO. (OK we still have these things in some more devoutly religious  and obviously morally advanced:)  countries.)  But because of some all too conservative people, the rights of two people to be happy are denied based on out-dated texts and bigoted moral judgments. The fact that in the western world that the only real opposition to things like gay marriage comes from the religious communities is telling of their archaic and flawed morality. Gay people can not help being the way they are, it is not a belief system, or a choice it is an ingrained hormonally shaped sexuality, and if you are not this way you should count yourself lucky. Imagine being brought into a world where the very nature of yourself is ridiculed on any given day, where want you feel drawn to without explanation or choice is being chastised by huge groups of people, people that do not want to listen to evidence or reason, they KNOW they are right and that is that, and they WILL make your life hell because they deem themselves superior and in the right. A gay couple can not get married in a religious ceremony, so if they are not put together in the eyes of whichever God it is then it should not matter to the religious if Gay people had a legal ceremony or not.    TBH they are generally in line with me. Good to know that   They are not in line with you mate, as I said before in ancient Greece and Rome homosexuality was rampant and anyway even if ancient civilizations are in line with you then that shows where your morals stand, outdated and archaic.

If you want money in life and you work to get it, and this is what makes you happy you are entitled to that.

Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date?

Your dispute is that you don't believe God says that, but doesn't everyone have a right to religious freedom   Whether or not God said anything is irrelevant and i don't believe in God so I don't believe he said anything.

While one of you is probably right, it does not necessarily mean that the other is stupid or bigoted to believe in something different.

Everyone  is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.   It is only because of the time when this was written that it does not state Sexuality as it was written in 1948 and Homosexuality has only become legal in most countries since the 70's.   Again, says who? All of these rights and guaranteed freedoms are nice to talk about, but they just don't exist   See first right from Declaration.

It was because of the name calling that I got involved in the first place, as I have said before it is everyones right to religious beliefs and I believe that if they want to go about celebrating their beliefs then that is OK too, where it stops being OK is when they try to use their scriptures to affect laws in secular societies by demonising Homosexuals and trying to change the attitudes of the people. I also have gay friends and family and I coming from a strict Roman Catholic house have witnessed the devastating effect these beliefs can have on a persons mentality and general well-being, there is a friend of the family that was beaten so badly for being Gay that he had to move away.   No, I'm using the logic of something you believe to be wrong to show you how religious people feel. Did you know that many religions believe homosexual acts are only one step down from murder?   There is no logic in the equation as the two are far from equal, murder robs people of their dignity, right to life and robs families of loved ones and causes nothing but pain it is a heinous act. Homosexuality creates no victim or pain or loss of dignity, etc.   Many religions believe God destroys whole cities if they permit homosexuality.

Many people don't and religious people are entitled to vote just the same as everyone else, it would be that if they kept to this right and not infringe on the rights of others that their case could be respectfully considered. I can empathize with people from a religious community, I was one as a child, my own mother would rather die than give up her beliefs.   They have a right to vote their conscious, and it has everything to do with religion. Do you have a right to force your morality on them and have their tax dollars support something they find to be a crime next to murder?   Again I agree with you on the rights of everyone to vote. I have no right to force my morality on anyone, I am not trying to do that. What I was trying to get across was the fact that not all is known and what is known is constantly being questioned, religious texts can be interpreted to anyones avail, and it is proved that they are massively edited, the problem comes when secular societies and religious communities clash.   Surely if no-one is being hurt then there should be no problem, if religious people believe it is wrong then they should consider the fact that a civil union is not a religious one, and therefore void in the eyes of their creator.   As for the fear that God destroys cities that permit homosexuality, I believe you are referring to Sodom and Gomorrah, did God not remove his faithful from these cities before destroying them and did he not pledge that he would  ""never again curse the ground on account of man""  after Noah's flood so there is nothing to fear.

"your morals stand, outdated and archaic.   No it means that their morals can still be applied today.   homosexuality was rampant   Now if that isn't exxageration I don't know what is....   Do we still have a view of women as second class citizens, NO   Not many of these cultures did.   do we still have gladiatorial events where people are killed for amusement, NO. Do we still have widespread slavery,   Barbaric whites...  Gay people shouldn't impose their way of life to normal people. They can do what they want behind closed doors and maybe normal people can overlook it. But sitting their justifying their sinful acts is disgraceful and disgusting.

It is a pity you feel this way as I guess it is only going to become easier for Gay people to go about their lives as straight people do.   My last point on this farcical debate is that Homosexuals getting married in a civil ceremony and being viewed only legally should not enrage the religious. Religious people regard their marriage as a bond put together by their God as this is not the case of Homosexual marriage why would it matter, as they will be judged by whichever God the religious person is prescribing to, which should make them more comfortable with it as they should know that punishment will be served. I do not believe in any God or follow any religion therefore the comments I just made are purely an appeal to logic.

"This leads back to my original argument: It is not logical to engage in intercourse for any purpose other than procreation.  However, seeing how nobody can comprehend this form of logic (I call it 'Vulcanian logic'), I shall have to think of another argument.  Here's an argument:  Religion  is  (I know that you'll disagree!) a religious rite.  Another argument:  Marriage is betwixt a man and a woman, can a homosexual marriage truly  be  a marriage?   Condoms prevent the spread of disease.   Only 27% of teenage females who engage in coitus do so with their partner wearing a condom.

"From a functonal perspective, sex is designed for procreation to ensure the survival of a species. However, in contemporary society, sex is also a form of pleasure. A human being's mind is very complex capable of everything from philosophical thought to emotional depth beyond that of mere animals. Pleasure/happiness helps keep us sane. The same way fear helps keep people alive. Regardless whether your Vulcanian logic find emotions to be ""illogical,"" the point is they exist. Their presence is not accidental. The logic is we should pass laws that make society happy while not infringing on the rights of others. Not create laws that would make sense in a world that doesn't exist: an emotionless species with a population problem. However, the issue isn't about legalizing gay sex. The issue is gay  marriage.   Marriage  on the other hand is a legal contract between two people asking society to recognize them as a family unit conferred with certain rights (health administrative proxies, administration of estates, etc...) How consenting adults choose to have sex should have nothing to do with denying them rights. Furthermore, a law prohibiting gay marriage isn't grounded in logic rather religious dogma. Archaic laws grounded in religious dogma should not be dictating rights in a secular society.   Only 27% of teenage females who engage in coitus do so with their partner wearing a condom.   My ultimate point here is that claiming Homosexuality results in the spread of disease is irrelevant to the argument because so does heterosexuality when done without protection.

"At this point it seems you are being obstinate and wilfully obtuse.   Prove that homosexuality is natural.   Define natural. Regardless, Human beings are not and should not be governed by what is deemed natural.   It shows future generations what the world looks (or rather, looked) like, primarily before the advent of the camera.   It is impossible for that to be the reason for paintings before the camera, as the artists would not have known what a camera is or that it would ever be created.   Hedonism is not logical.   Why not? Pleasure is entirely logical. Conversely, a life without pleasure is completely illogical. Sex is pleasurable, and a life without that fails to conform to the primary compulsion of life - procreation. Regardless, humans are not logical creatures. We have emotions, none of which serve any logical purpose. Our society makes sex a taboo, which is illogical considering our natural urge to mate.    How are 'human rights' pleasurable?   This is implied by the displeasure of having none.

With out emotion we would have nothing stopping us from touching the next red glowing thing we see and our hands would be very burnt. Emotionally, we don't like pain.   One of my oldest friends is gay; if he one day wants the legal rights granted by marriage; he should be able to have them even if the other consenting adult in the contract is male. Personally I wouldn't mind marriage being abolished, perhaps replaced with a contract that legally incorporates someone into your family, without the religious and sexual undertones of marriage.

Denying them this right is only done out of bigotry and fear.   Some don't like it because they think the divorce rate will go higher. How is that bad? Its main effect might be on children, which usually isn't that bad. Many of my friends do not have nuclear families, and they are perfectly healthy functioning members of society. Marriage should be like contracts between employers and employees: well defined and voluntary.   Some don't like it because of their (interpretation of their) religion. In short these people do not believe in the separation of church and state, and are nothing less then fear ridden, insecure little tyrants. I can go into the details of their psychology and position, but its not flattering at all. Laws should be backed by secular and logical reasoning with the goal of increasing the well being of society. Marriage improves ""the lot in life"" of many people, for some it doesn't but they find it worth the try. Allowing gay marriage means that more people will find marriage an improvement to their lives. Marriage, unless combined with other causes, doesn't cause any considerable physical, financial, etc harm to others. Its a benefit to society with out Loss to society. There is no reasonable reason to not allow it.

Once again, I state that you don't have to be married to feel like this or be known to be like this, but a ring on the finger USED to keep other rivals away.   So why can't homosexuals marry? If heterosexuals can, why not they? Oh, if we are using the Bible as an excuse, I would like to say that we don't stone adulterers anymore and God loves us NO MATTER WHAT. He wants us to be happy.

There is not even a direct ban on discrimination based on race, color, or creed. What we do have are provisions that are often interpreted that way. The 15th and 19th Amendments, which ensured that blacks and women could vote, hint at a policy of non-discrimination, but they are actually quite specific. They only involve suffrage and nothing else. However, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that discrimination based on traits such as race are a violation of due process and not constitutional (when done by the government or an agent of the government). It is a complex issue. Again, a ban on discrimination based on sexual preference is not a part of the Constitution, but has been extended, to some degree, based on the 14th Amendment by the courts. The subject is far from a closed one at this time.""  In fact I´m socked.

"Marriage is a state-sponsored institution that gives some financial incentive for couples to be married because stable, 2 parent families raising children create a stable society. While it is obviously clear that many families do not fulfill this requirement, no homosexual couple can produce a child on their own. So maybe only 40% of hetro couples fulfill their obligation of being a good home and raising children there (I'm making this number up, but you get the idea), 0% of homosexual couples have children.  Maybe the financial incentives aren't worth it at all, in which case lets get the govt out of the marriage business (my own opinion), but there seems to be no incentive to invest in homosexual marriage. This is why I vote against it, but as I've always said, if a voting majority gives gays marriage, ok. It's really not an enormous deal.

This would be an impossible and expensive task (this is where we probably will disagree if you don't believe in very limited constitutional govt, which very few people believe in anymore). Besides, right now marriage IS equal: everyone can marry a member of the opposite sex. There is no inequality here. If we want to give people the right to marry members of the same sex, then let's do it, but this is, in fact, a change.  Before you call bigot, I am, in fact, not very religious and literally DON'T CARE if gays marry. It doesn't affect my life at all. I have two friends, a gay couple, who would make a perfect marriage. I just think people need to step away from their high emotions and look at this issue from the larger perspective. Also, everyone has a right to their own opinion and religion isn't bigotry. Even though I don't agree, if you don't want to vote for gay marriage because it's against your religion, congratulations, you have that right. In fact, this right actually IS a right, whereas marriage is nowhere in the constitution and not guaranteed to anyone. Don't like it? Change it! That is your right!

"I would say raising children in such a fashion that we have a stable society has more to do with family finance, along with guidance and attention a child receives then whether or not the child is part of a nuclear family.   If your raised by one parent, and they bring home 80,000 a year by working just 4 hours a day(lets say their good with stocks), then lets say this person spends considerable time with their children; maybe he/she home schools them or something. That person would still be providing a good home, because the material, emotional and developmental needs of their children would be meet. If later this person gets into a good relationship, either with a member of the same sex or not; then the child needs would be even better supplied; and lets say this couple then wants to make it a triple and bring in a third person; even better for the kid right? This benefit continues for awhile, but eventually the needs of the group would overcome the means of supply; which means the group would become splintered(but still connected) and function more like a tribe then a family. Even that wouldn't be bad for the kid though, ""it takes a village to raise a child"".  Some homosexual couples adopt. gay marriage would allow for people to pool resources together better because of the financial incentives, meaning more stable families being more capable of adopting which would lessen the burden on foster care. There are many incentives to invest in homosexual marriage, i haven't came close to touching all of them here.

"Some times it feels like gays are trying to force themselves into a club where they are clearly not wanted.  There are two parts to the gay marriage issue.  1. The love aspect  2. The benefits  The love aspect can be resolved in many different ways. They can:  1. Have their own ceremony with friends and relatives  2. Petition religions to change their stance on gay marriage  3. Start their own religion  The benefits aspect can be resolved simply by petitioning the government to stop using the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple (with age of consent) to join in a civil union.  In short, this issue shouldn't even be an issue because there are ways around the situation. If you don't want to go around the situation, then you're trying to force yourself in.

"The right to vote has nothing to do with marriage benefits     I think it does in that a democracy can at times tend toward a tyranny of the majority over the minority – if women can’t vote, it takes a majority of people (or, as in the case of constitutional amendments 2/3 of both houses and 3/4 of all state legislatures) who must give them that right, and if a majority of law makers are not gay, it still takes a majority of those law makers to agree to make gay marriage legal.    I see the gay community's fight for gay marriage as an uphill battle   I believe  you are right . I think the battle to get civil unions is not only a compromise that will still end up maintaining at least some semantic distinction between gay couples and heterosexual couples who will still say married, etc. – I think it is actually more of an uphill battle rather than an easier one. As I tried to explain in my argument above, to institute civil unions nationwide, you would have to go through the entire US Code and replace all references to marriage, with civil unions. Additionally, you would likely still have to fight in every single state to get the laws changed to recognize those unions. Even treaties that deal with recognition of US marriages overseas would likely be affected, and who knows what else. Repealing DOMA would allow just one state to legalize gay marriage and all other states would recognize it like they do the marriages that take place in other states today.   The only reason not to use the word marriage is to appease bigots who somehow find the idea of two people loving each other unbearable if those two people happen to have the same naughty parts.  I think past compromises like don’t ask don’t tell intentionally left policy in an inherently unmaintainable state that is bound to be overturned in the future and therefore had a modicum of acceptability, but civil unions do not possess that attribute as prominently and would only be reconsidered if that semantic difference grew into something more.

"Force themselves into a club where there not wanted?  How does any gay getting married effect any straight couple? Your argument, which you continue to repeat time and time again, is ridiculous, and you know it.  All gays want is equality, and if the government stopped using the word marriage but instead used civil unions that would be  great . Look at this  site  that advocates equal marriage rights. It gives a number of scenarios:   We want the Flag of Equal Marriage to be complete, with all 50 stars lit up. We see three routes to marriage equality, as we define it:  1. Every individual state could pass a law allowing same-sex marriage.  2. The federal government could repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and allow same-sex marriage at the federal level, overriding all state-level bans.  3. The term ""marriage"" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all ""marriages"" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.   So here you're arguing a straw man ""gays aren't being reasonable"" argument.  Back to the whole ""joining a club thing"" and why it's bullshit. When African-Americans and other minorities ""forced"" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted, should they have stopped?  In addition, marriage isn't a club. There aren't members only meetings where only married people are allowed to get into, and married people don't have to do anything for other married couples. Marriage is the legal (and often religious/cultural) union of two people who love each other and intend to spend the rest of their lives together. So allow me to repeat: how does letting gays marry affect, even a little bit, straight married couples? What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?  If this is the best argument that you can come up with for opposing gay marriage, maybe you need to reevaluate your position and realize how ridiculous you sound (even more so than usual).

"I'll admit, I do not support gay marriage. This does not mean I hate gays or think homosexuality is a sin. Marriage I feel should be between a man and a woman. In the U.S., this decision I believe should be voted on in a State by State fashion. It should be up to the individual state to allow gay-marriage. If in my state we voted on it and is passed, so be it. If I can re-call Arizona, Florida, and California had a vote on Gay Marriage, and I believe all three votes came out to be against gay marriage. California, who would have thought? I think when it comes to gay marriage this has a major ""Bradley Effect"".   As for the rest of the world, its up to the rest of the countries to decide whether or not to accept it.

"Here is why I disagree. In Arkansas, their was a law passed that banned people from adopting who were living with a sexual partner who they were not married to. This law had no other purpose then to stop homosexuals from adopting children. Right now Arkansas has more then three times more children that need adoption then there are available families to take them in, but guess what? Apparently taking away rights from homosexuals is more important. There is absolutely no proof that children who grow up in homosexual households suffer any sort of added mental problems. In fact, a court in Arkansas had  unanimously  agreed to overturn a ban on gay couples becoming foster parents because the reasons stated were, to be frank, bullshit.  The only way that we can fight homophobia is by showing people that homosexuals deserve the same rights as straight couples. I know you say yo don't hate gays, but why do you oppose gay marriage? Don't homosexuals deserve the right to have their love legally recognized? And don't say that there should be civil unions, that's the same thing telling African Americans they can drink from a water fountain, but not the same one as whites. Separate but equal can never be equal.

"Damn it Soccer, you know better than this:   This law had no other purpose then to stop homosexuals from adopting children.   Are you telling me that you are clairvoyant? I thought you didn't believe in that crap.  Doesn't that law also prevent heterosexual couples who are living together from adopting? What? There are no heterosexual couples living together who want to adopt? What was that? If there were, they would just get married and adopt? Do you realize that there are obstacles, other than being gay, that handicap a couple to the point where they decide not to get married? Not because they don't want to get married but because of the obstacles.
",0
"I'm not a clairvoyant, but I can make basic inferences. Let's see if you can follow the chain of logic.  In 2006 a law banning homosexuals from adopting was  overturned by the Arkansas supreme court unanimously . Then two years later the law was passed making it illegal for unmarried couples to adopt (and as you are aware from previous debates on the subject, homosexuals can't get married in Arkansas).  Obviously this will have an  effect  on more than just homosexuals, but the  intent  was clearly to circumvent the Supreme Court decision and keep homosexuals from adopting.
",1
"OK, so let me say back to you what I understood you say. A group of people (who hate gays) successfully figured out a way to either circumvent, or navigate thought, the system. Now, isn't that what I'm telling gays to do?  But more importantly, lets say that you are 100 % correct and that the law sacrificed unmarried heterosexuals in order to strike back at homosexuals. I think that you would agree that this would be a very spiteful and hateful thing to do. Now, are you telling me that you want to try and change those people's mind and remain living there. Let me ask you a question. Do you really think that just because a law is passed that people all of the sudden are going to change their mind and stop hating you? And you really want to keep living there? Knowing that you are hated and despised for forcing something down their throats? Something they didn't want? Let me see.... what is it that some white people do when ""undesirables"" move into their neighborhoods? Who benefits? Which is the best course of action to take?

"No, you're telling gays to stop fighting for equal marriage rights, and making the assumption that gays  aren't  doing the other things you mention like fighting for domestic partnerships or civil unions in places where there is no recognition of homosexual couples. You also seem to imply that there are homosexuals who have put their relationships on hold until gay marriage is legal... which, is obviously ridiculous.  First: the vote was 57% for the ban on adoption, and 43% against, so in no way is it an overwhelming majority of the population that is against homosexuals adopting.  Second: I'm not saying necessarily that people despise homosexuals, only that they want to stop them from getting married. Most of these people probably wouldn't be outwardly hostile (though some might) but instead just avoid them. Most of these people clearly have been taught that homosexuality is wrong and that the  right  thing to do is to outlaw the marriage.  Third: Why should we cater to those who are being intolerant of people's lifestyles?  Fourth: Things like racism or prejudice against a group tend to be because someone has never met someone from that group. By forcing people who are against homosexuals to actually confront homosexuals, there is a good chance there opinions will change. At the very least, those children who might have grown up to be intolerant will be more used to the idea of gay couples.... especially if their friends have parents who are gay. Just look at the progress that has been made as far as racism since the 1960's. People were against the laws that ended things like segregation. In some southern states it was even the majority that opposed an end to segregation. Go down there now and see how many people would support segregation. Sometimes the laws need to come first, and then popular opinion will follow... especially on issues that deal with civil rights, because no one should have their rights stripped by popular vote.

"I'm not telling gays to stop fighting for equal marriage rights. I'm telling them to take a different tactic. If you say that they are already doing that, then great.   Third: Why should we cater to those who are being intolerant of people's lifestyles?   Why should they carter to gays who are intolerant of their belief?  By  forcing people  who are against homosexuals to actually confront homosexuals, there is a good chance a fight will break out. You claim that it is wrong for people to  forcing gays  into a situation where they can't get married but you have no qualms about  forcing people  into accepting gays. WTF, soccer? If forcing people into something they don't want is wrong, then it's wrong. It isn't wrong for one group of people but OK for another. You can't have your cake and eat it too.  My point is that it is wrong to force anyone into anything they don't want to do; period. My solution is to go around those people. Not force them into doing it my way.  And again, WHAT RIGHTS? A piece of paper that says you're married? Benefits? If you want benefits, fight for benefits.   Sometimes the laws need to come first, and then popular opinion will follow... especially on issues that deal with civil rights   You can't legislate morality. That's the part that drives me up the wall. Someone telling me that something should or should not be legal because it is or isn't morally right. Sometimes the person talking to me about morals is an atheists or is pro-abortion. It drives me insane. Who are you to dictate your morals to me? You don't want me to dictate my morals to you. Why is it a one way street with you?  Just because ""gays want to get married"" does not make it  a right , nor does it make it  morally right  (or wrong for that matter), nor do gays necessarily suffer if they don't get to marry.  The fact that ""gays being allowed to marry doesn't hurt anyone"" is not a logical argument for gay marriage because I can just as easily say, ""It doesn't hurt anyone if gays don't get married.""   There are savages living in the bush that don't know from marriage as we know it. They live together, do what comes naturally, and that's that. they don't have a piece of paper that says they are married.  If a gay couple do not have a piece of paper that says that they are married, how are they hurt? They are not hurt. They just don't get ""extra"" benefits. If I have a piece of candy and you want it and I don't give it to you, you are not hurt, you just don't have a piece of candy, you don't have something extra, you don't have something you didn't have to begin with. So how are you hurt?  Now, if I take something away from you, then you have a legitimate gripe. These marriage benefits are not taken away from gays. These marriage benefits are just  not given  to gay couples. If gays want those benefits then fight for those benefits. But don't give me some sob story about how gays are hurt because you aren't given something they want.  Oh, but they want the same thing as heterosexual couples. Hell, I want a million dollars. CEO's get a million dollars all the time. Am I hurt because I'm not given a million dollars? Am I right in asking for a million dollars? I never had a million dollars before. Do I have a right to a million dollars? Am I suffering? Does it hurt anyone if I were given a million dollars? Why can't I have my million dollars? Maybe I should just figure out how to get a million dollars on my own. WOW!!! What a freaking concept!!! I have control over getting a million dollars!!! And I'm willing to bet every penny of it that once I get it, it wont necessarily make me any happier than I am already, right now.  This crap about wanting to express their love in front of friends and family can be expressed without a legal piece of paper. If you want a legal piece of paper in order for it to mean something, go to a lawyer and have him draw something up. You want commitment? Then specify what it is you expect to get out of the union during and afterwords (in the event it doesn't pan out). Specify exactly what it is you are willing to give up during the relationship and afterwords (in the event it doesn't pan out). Then, if it doesn't pan out, come and tell me how happy that piece of paper made you feel.

Don't recognize a person's right to tell you ""no."" If you stand there and argue with that person, then you have just recognized their right to tell you ""no"" and you are now trying to change their their mind to say ""yes"" so that they let you do whatever it is you want to do.   Basically what I'm saying is that the way gays have been going about fighting for their rights recognizes the opposition's right to say ""no.""  Now, I agree with and support this:  3. The term ""marriage"" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all ""marriages"" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.  I don't support number one because it means that the rights of the opponents of same sex marriages are being trampled on and they will therefore fight back. In other words, it legitimizes their right to oppose same sex marriage and gives them reason to fight back.  I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights. The federal government has way too much power.  Now, I did not say that gays are unreasonable for wanting same sex marriage. I am saying that if they are trying to follow scenarios one and two above, they are being unreasonable in the way they are pursuing it.   The argument that ""it doesn't affect any straight couple"" doesn't work because anyone could say, ""And? So what? Who cares? The majority has voted. They don't want it!""  The whole ""African-Americans and other minorities ""forced"" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted"" doesn't work because the word marriage has a religious aspect to it that needs to be separated from the legal aspect. If it can't be removed, then another word needs to take its place.  You ask, ""What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?"" The answer is: Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so. By arguing the point you are admitting/recognizing their right to oppose you. If your stance is that they have no right to oppose you, then you need not argue the point; you just figure a way to navigate the system or go around the system.  Now, lets see how ridiculous you sound when you say that gays have never been able to find an ounce of happiness because they don't have a piece of paper that says that they are legally married. What a bunch of crap. Do you actually expect me to believe that a piece of paper is going to magically make them find happiness? Come on.  Gays have been living together, spending the rest of their lives together, loving each other, expressing their love for each other in front of friends and family for ages. If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again. Those people who hate gays will always hate gays regardless of this piece of paper you so desperately want.

"OK, I'll go on record. homosexuality is  not  a choice.  Having said that, I disagree with any court that claims marriage is a right anymore than driving a car is a right.  When I say something is ""a right"" I mean a God given right. For example, the right to pursue happiness. Gays are free to pursue happiness. Freedom is another right. Gays are free.  The U.S. cannot tell me who I can and cannot marry because I am the one who decides who to marry. The U.S. may not recognize my marriage but that doesn't impede on my decision (who to marry) nor does it impede my happiness. The only thing it impedes is any benefits I would be eligible for if the U.S. recognized my marriage.   A country has a right to decide what it will or will not recognize. The decision as to what it will or will not recognize is based on the majority. Anything else is just the tail waging the dog. A situation where the minority rules the majority and that is not right.  During the American Civil War, both sides had roughly the same number of people. Enough to sustain the war for 4 years. If one side had had more troops than the other, the war would have ended much quicker.   Eventually the side against slavery won. Eventually the North had enough people on its side to constitute a majority and end slavery. Slavery did not come to an end because it was immoral. Slavery came to an end because  the majority  did not want slavery.  Same thing with suffrage. Women did not get the right to vote because it was the right thing to do. Women got the right to vote because the majority of the people wanted it.  Currently, the majority of the people do not want gay marriage. If they did, gay marriage would be legal. I expect that to change in the near future. Any attempt to force the majority into some thing it clearly does not want is wrong.  The supreme court handed down their ruling. And yet, it is not the law of the land. Why? Because the majority does not want it. The supreme court's decision (without the sanction of the majority) is moot.  Now, you can go and fly in the face of reality and scream and shout, ""But the supreme court said...."" and you still wouldn't get any further than you are today. I, on the other hand, recognize reality for what it is and proposed an alternate solution around the problem. A solution that you said gay groups are pursuing.  So, you can dispute me all you want. It wont change a thing. Marriage will only become a right when the majority sees it that way. Until then, it is not a right. Regardless of what the supreme court says.    You can't legislate morality.

Marriage is actually just a social arrangement. Many religions have tenets related to marriage, but marriage can exist completely outside of religion. The government doesn’t (and shouldn’t) use any religions rules as the arbiter of what is acceptable in terms of marriage (we do not have laws requiring dowery, or that fathers of wife’s who could not prove their virginity pay the husband 50 sheckles, or that wives obey their husband as if he is god, etc.) We take our morals and our common sense and our constitution and some to a consensus on what should be legal – e.g. we allow divorce for more than just adultery because we found practical cases for divorce other than adultery (spousal abuse, etc.)    Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so   The right to be treated equally under the law is already being denied. Equality isn’t being denied because people are talking about it – it is certainly the opposite.    If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again   Equality under law is more than just a piece of paper – social security benefits, health care, tax and court treatment, etc. – gays are taxed equally but receive less in government benefits than heterosexuals.

"I appeciate the support and must admit that I had been debating back and forth with hellno and initially thought your response was from him so I may have been harsher than I would have been otherwise. Sorry for that, but hopefully I can clear up the FFC thing with this post.   FFC basically says that one state must recognize the marriages of other states   this is where you are mistaken - the FFC says Congress can prescribe the effect of one state's laws on another state including saying that a law passed in one state has no effect on another state (DOMA).  The reason DOMA might be unconstitutional is not the FFC, it is the equal protection clause. Here is the CA ruling in the case on Prop 8 that Dubois and Olson are taking to the Supreme Court (the Plaintiff's case starts on page 5).   https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/ 09cv2292/files/09cv2292-ORDER.pdf

"the FFC says Congress can prescribe the effect of one state's laws on another state   To say that we must disregard The Full Faith and Credit Clause in a particular instance, cannot be an effect of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  No Effect =/= Effect  The only thing the caveat ""to prescribe the effect thereof"" does is it allows congress to determine HOW a law is recognized by another state not WHETHER it is recognized.  The equal protection clause is not the only part of the constitution DOMA violates.

"Sometimes people get an idea stuck in their head and it becomes impossible to shake. It will likely take someone besides me to explain what you are interpreting incorrectly so if this post doesn't work I will leave it to someone else.  law passed by another state has no effect =/= FFC clause has no effect  Utah can ""recognize"" that 2 people did something that Massachusetts calls a marriage but Utah can say that act has no ""effect"" within its borders.  I gave you a case where 2 of the top attorneys in the country are challenging DOMA in the Supreme Court and they are not arguing that it violates the FFC clause. Can you find any case where any credible attorney is arguing otherwise?

"Well, in California, it did go to the Supreme Court, and guess what? They said gay marriage was legal! But then, Prop 8 was passed. The people campaigning for Prop 8 used fear to get people to vote for it. They scared people into thinking that their children would be affected by gay marriage.  The only way to ensure the right of homosexuals to marry would be to get an amendment passed. This would be virtually impossible though because there is still a lot of homophobia in the U.S. Also Church's, like the Mormon Church, encouraged their members to donate money and vote for Prop 8.   Honestly right now, religion is the biggest deterrent in this whole process. The only legitimate reasons against gay marriage are religious ones (i.e. sanctity of marriage) and of course this is a secular nation, so therefore they shouldn't sway people. Unfortunately they do.  To sum up, I have no idea. Fight homophobia would be my biggest suggestion. And maybe tax church's who take political stances on issues?

"It seems that the only real argument against gay marriage is because the bible says it is wrong. That is your personal belief and your personal opinion, don't force it on to others. The bible says homosexuality is a sin and you extend this to say that gay marriage should not be allowed. Fine, don't get married to someone of the same gender as you.  No one's forcing you to marry someone of the same gender. If your personal belief system tells you that it is wrong then fine, don't have same-sex partners. That doesn't mean you need to go around inflicting your dogma onto the general population.   Now, you cannot possibly say that it is immoral and then quote the bible.  Blind obedience to ancient texts is about as far away from morality as you can get.  The bible isn't a moral code just because it holds conservative view points.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------     If the bible really was a source of infallible morals, then it should be perfectly moral to:    Sell one's daughters as sex slaves  (Exodus 21:7-11)   Kill adulterers  (Leviticus 20:10)   Kill blasphemers  (Leviticus 24:10-16)   Rape women  (Isaiah 13:15-18)   Kill women, babies and children  (Isaiah 14:21), (Hosea 9:11-16), (Ezekiel 9:5-7), (Exodus 12:29-30), (Isaiah 13:15-18).    --------------------------------------- ----------------------    Morality should be something which can be discussed with reason, logic and evidence.

By denying homosexuals the right to marry you are creating a second class of people; you are discriminating against them by saying that they are not worthy of long-term, legally recognised relationships, yet heterosexuals are.

It opens their minds to a different way of life than other kids get; and come on, if they have two parents who love them, what differance does it make what sex they are? People need to begin to understand that everyone deserves equal rights, and these kids who have gay parents will grow up defending that right and making a differance in the world, where as a kid with heterosexual parents who may happen to be homophobic, will not grow up this way, and may even get it doctrinated in their minds that homosexuality is wrong... so really, what's worse? The kids who help our world evolve by sharing their experiences and common knowlodge having lived with gay parents, and grew up to succesful, or kids who grow up passing on the message that homosexuality is wrong? Homophobia needs to be a thing of the past.

"We have an overpopulation problem in the US. In the world, actually. Yes, homosexual couples cant reproduce in the ""traditional"" manner.

Better no parents than good parents, is that it? If heterosexual couples were already adopting 100% of kids up for adoption then this ""who will they talk to about this issue and that issue"" bullshit might have a shred of credibility, but they don't.   I'm not adopted, but I bet its much easier to have the bird and the bees talk, for example, with an adoptive gay parent - of either gender, than it is to have that talk with the manager of the adoption facility.   I think gays have every bit the potential to be amazing parents that straights do. But seeing as how straight couples leave many children un-adopted, and seeing as how it's obvious you can be a horrible parent even when your ignorant little gender role is filled, i dont know why this issue even needs discussion.

In England the debate has come down to whether or not a legally identical thing (Civil-partnerships) should be renamed marriage. In my mind, both sides are being pedantic over wording and I think it's pretty pointless. However, if it was a matter of race, I would support changing ""black marriage"" to just marriage, so that's the view I have to hold here as well.  They're not crazy, they're Christian. They have been taught forever to overthrow their own view of morality and reason, and instead accept what some guy in a big building up the road tells them. I think I can forgive them on the grounds of ignorance. I can't forgive the millions of straight men and women that couldn't be bothered to vote simply because the issue didn't directly affect them.

"There are lots of binding traditions you could call ""marriage"" and Christians were far from the first to invent these. It seems silly they would be allowed to ban others from it because it's their word (not their concept).   Also marriage is a lot more than a religious tradition nowadays; you can have many different churches preform a marriage, not all of them Christian, as you can the government through a courthouse. One acceptable option would to be to completely sever the link between church and state in this regard and stop giving financial benefits to married couples; then gays would only be denied something of religious significance.   Another viable option is for Christianity to change it's views, as it has done numerous times in the past, to allow gay marriage. Yet another alternative is for Christianity to allow the gays to form a splinter religion, as has been done numerous times in the past, and this similar and affiliated religion would be able to sanction gay marriage.   In conclusion: Christians didn't invent marriage, it's not their business to police it. If they want to police it, the state shouldn't compensate and reward them for their efforts. If they still want tax breaks and financial aid, they need to drag themselves out of the stone age yet again, or otherwise allow gay churches to preform their own gay marriages, if they really want nothing to do with it.

"I did not say Christianity invented marraige, I merely said it was their tradition, meaning they adopted it. (I am aware that other religions conduct marraiges, but seeing as thie debate involves mainly British and Americans I've just used Christianity as an example everyone would be familiar with).  Why would someone want to be married in the first place unless the specifically follow that religion? Gay people can have civili partnerships why do the  need  to be allowed to marry as well.
",0
"Oftentimes it's one specific issue that causes some religious people to want to splinter off and make their own similar but different (on that one issue) religion. One needs only look at the many, many branches of Christianity to see that people have a lot of different opinions on proper Christian faith and behavior. I don't see why homosexuals shouldn't be able to do the same, and have rights that other splinter churches enjoy (there are LGBT Christian churches nearby that I know of, but they cant preform a legally binding gay marriage). We allow religious people to pick-and-choose the aspects of their faith that they want to follow and don't usually revoke privileges or rights for it. You can have just about every sin in the book on your hands and still be Christian, still have a Christian marriage, but these things don't always hold true if your sin is homosexuality. I get that homosexuality, like everything else, is an abominable sin in the Christian faith, but they don't allow or deny marriage rights based on how much you sin or what your sins are. If you're a gay Christian and you want to marry another gay Christian, why can't you have a Christian marriage?   I guess I've always seen the beliefs of the church and Christians as very mailable and ever-shifting; they alter their views so they can be accepted and supported by their host community. If the Church still opposed interracial marriage, for example, priests and Christians would be mocked and ridiculed for it. Yet at one time it was a valid and accepted position for them to hold. Allowing gay marriage is just the next grudgingly progressive step this backward religion is going to take; they're going to kick, scream, and really dig their heels in, no doubt, but Christianity has been fighting a losing battle since it was created, always giving ground to civil liberties at the last possible second, before they draw too much hatred upon themselves for their bigotry.

Also, if they were allowed to get married and then adopt, then alot of children will get homes, its a win win situation, and I can't see why anyone loses at any point?  Does it bother you seeing two men or women together?  Does it bother anyone seing two men or women together?  Im not saying ALL gays should get married. The ones who want to, they should do it.

"Support for same sex marriage is growing rapidly and it IS only a matter of time before it is legal in ALL the states. I believe it is mostly due to the younger generations such as myself. Older generations were mind-fucked into believing many things were ""OK"" such as slavery and even after that was abolished racism was practiced in many households. as I'm sure after Gay marriage is legal there will be many homophobic households. Its like someones Dad being a racist and 20 years down the line they find themselves spurting a racist comment and catch themselves not even believing their own words. It was forced into their young minds. Younger generations have been increasingly allowed to explore their OWN beliefs the result of which is increased support for things that older generations were protecting out of tradition. Just because something is tradition doesn't mean its right.

"Since a ritual that binds two people together as life-mates has absolutely no harmful effect upon society, and since romantic love is regarded as a good thing, I'd like to know why disallowing gay marriage is a good thing.  If it's not harmful, why outlaw it? Because you're squeamish? So, you'd let your squeamishness prevent two people from performing a ritual that harms no one and only strengthens their relationship? What kind of immoral douche are you to allow mere squeamishness to let you do something so selfish?  Except, of course, people against gay marriage would say I'm wrong. Though I'm not. They are all just squeamish, and they use pointless excuses to try and reason away that they're just squeamish.

""For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.""  Murder everyone, even small children, that has ever cursed at their parents? That would require the deaths of millions of 10 year olds. I assume you don't believe this. This is in fact said in the very same speech that your quote comes from.   We can even go all the way down to 20:18, where it clearly states that having sex with your wife while she is menstruating should be met with exile. Seems a little harsh considering it is possible for it to start during sex.   Then it states things that have been dis-proven. ""If a man shall lie with his uncle's wife ... they shall die childless."" (20:20), so even if you have shady morals regarding periods and child murder, you cannot claim that everything in this chapter is true.

In fact, Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful. I can't speak for Islam or Judaism because I have no knowledge of them, so I'll skip over them.

The meaning of the pursuit of the marriage between homosexual couples is in the desire to be seen as a legal, justifiable entity with the same freedoms that we heterosexuals take for granted. Why should this be allowed? Well, why not? Why does it seem as though the sanctions of governmental regulation is influenced by Christianity? The concept of marriage long predates most religions, including Christianity. Actually, it was established as a means to restrict the promiscuity of the couple, or group, as polygamy existed when it was established as well.   The problem is that regulations that are established now were molded by, and cater to, Christians for the most part. It is not the government's job to act as a church; it acts to preserve itself and the rights of the governed. Why would it be beneficial to have a government that imbues ""unequal"" rights to law-abiding citizens?

"OK, Does anyone edit anymore? ""marrige"" ""State"" come on, for such a serious question, one would expect care and concern in order to discern the truth.

People fall out of love all of the time. Why does sexual orientation, in the land of the free, change the definition of a contract? Marriage is a contract; why else would the courts be bogged down by disputes of property, wealth, and future holdings?  Second: When two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners? We, in the U.S.A. look away when companies contract each other to form conglomerates. Why do we care so much about people in love that we would show our prejudices?  Third: The human spirit should be without bonds. Let individuals be individuals. An atmosphere of growth will yield much more than the atmosphere of ""let's wait and see"".  If people want to bind themselves to a legal document, let them. Don't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect.

"I have never bought the argument that by giving gay marriage a different name that you automatically lower the status of gay marriage.   I have never bought the argument that just by having a different word for gay marriage, that you are saying that gay love is less worthy.  That type of stupid reasoning is what has allowed political correctness run amock. If you call a retarded person mentally challenged, it doesn't automatically change the way I perceive the person. By calling the person retarded, it doesn't automatically make me see him as less of a human being.   A rose, by any other name, is still a rose.

"Well the word marriage is used in two senses. There's the sense that people use it in normal conversation, and then there's the legal sense. We obviously can't force people to stop being bigoted assholes, but we obviously  can  change the legal meaning of the word. And we should do that. Because there's no good reason not to.

"There is a perfectly good reason. If you change the definition of the word marriage to be ""a civil union between two consenting adults"" then there won't be a word specify a heterosexual marriage.   If some one said to you ""I know this married couple, Amari and Jaidyn, who....""  and we were to use the current definition, then you would know that one of those people is male and the other female (although you may not be able to decide which is which). If we used your definition then we would have no idea if they were one of each, two males or two females.  The purpose of language is to clarify, not obfuscate. Otherwise, lets do away with half the words in the English language. We can combine the words that kind of have nearly the same meaning into one word. if that sounds like a crazy idea to you, then you are begining to understand that my stance against using the word marriage for gay unions has nothing to do with being a bigot.

You oppose gay marriage not because you're a bigot, but because the people you are politically aligned with are bigots.

"What does it mean to have gay marriages legalized? Can anyone tell me?  1 - Does it give gay married couples certain legal rights  afterwards  they wouldn't otherwise have?   2 - Or is it about acceptance by society?  If it's 1, then it's easily solved by giving united gay couples the same rights after their union. Taxation without representation is a no no.  If it's 2, here's what I think:  If you love each other, what the hell does it matter what anyone else thinks? But if you really insist, let's have a look at the meaning of marriage to most people. And to do that, let's picture ourselves going to a wedding:  a) We see 2 people who we assume love each other very much and want to be with each other for the rest of their lives (it doesn't matter if it doesn't always turn out that way).   b) We also think that they will want to go on to have children with each other and watch them grow and then to watch their children go on to marry and bear them grandchildren and so on and so forth (it doesn't matter if it turns out they can't bear children).   This is what we picture when we think of a marriage, it doesn't matter if we're in a cannibalistic tribe deep in the Amazon jungle or citizens of India. Of course we'll also form opinions about whether or not they look like a nice couple (amongst other irrelevant things) etc... but in our minds,  a  and  b  above are  the main elements  to a marriage. So if I see a wedding between those below, I'll not think of it the same way:  - 2 people of retired age, or   - 1 of retired age and the other half that, or  - 2 children, or  - 2 people of the same gender,  - a human and something else not,  Sure I'll be happy for them and I will sincerely wish them the best in love and life together, but I'm certainly not thinking of their union the same way I think of a straight couple's union as outlined above. It is what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it.   About changing the meanings of words to be more inclusive? No way, if anything we should be even more precise when it comes to words. Dictionaries don't define words, people write dictionaries that define words (Mahollinger). So I propose to exclude even more when it comes to definition of words and in law, but tax money should be distributed without prejudice by the government so any legal rights afforded a straight couple after marriage should never be withheld from a gay couple after their union.

"""legal rights...or...acceptance by society?""   Both. It's very hard to obtain legal rights without acceptance by society.   ""easily solved by giving united gay couples the same rights after their union""   Haha, if it were really that easy, same-sex civil unions would be legal in all fifty states.   ""a and b above are the main elements to a marriage.""   The ""upholding the sanctity of our dictionaries"" argument is retarded beyond belief. I can't believe so many of you are picking it up. We're talking about marriage in the  legal  sense. The common meaning of the term is completely irrelevant in this debate.  This debate is really about one question: Is homosexuality ok, or is it not? And if you leave religion out of the picture, as you should, the answer is inescapable: Yes, it's ok.
",1
"Both. It's very hard to obtain legal rights without acceptance by society.   Well, you know my stance. Marriage is about both  a   and   b . Legal rights must be equal for gay couples if their unions are no different to straight couples unions.   The ""upholding the sanctity of our dictionaries"" argument is retarded beyond belief. I can't believe so many of you are picking it up. We're talking about marriage in the legal sense. The common meaning of the term is completely irrelevant in this debate   What dictionary? You're so paranoid you think everyone around you is homophobic or something? I promise you I didn't look at a dictionary when I wrote this. Scout's honor! The legal sense of marriage comes from the common sense of marriage. You don't just make laws out of thin air, you base it on society's common rituals and traditions and ways of carrying out business and conducts.  Homosexuality is totally ok.
",0
"The problem is that basing the meaning of a word on its historical usage patterns leaves no room for evolution. When the legal definition of marriage was first established, it was, as you say, based on the views of society at the time.  But the views of society can change, and word meanings change along with them. And our laws should evolve to reflect these new meanings.  There was a time when black people didn't legally count as persons. Not too long ago you could've made the argument that the word ""man"" shouldn't include black men because generally when the word ""man"" was used, people thought of white men.  I still don't see what's so horrible about tweaking a legal definition.

",1
"I agree with you that words evolve with time as societies evolve.   So I guess the reason why the idea of marriage hasn't included gay unions is because societies haven't yet evolved to accept it.   Like I said before, I personally think of marriage as 2 people coming together with the intention of loving and being with each other for ever and to have children with each other etc.... Now, if some time in the future this picture comes up in my mind when I attend a gay wedding, then I don't even need a dictionary to tell me that a marriage is not just for straight people, the same way I didn't need a dictionary to tell me what a marriage is now.   Geriatrics marry young perky girls all the times, but don't ask me to accept that as a marriage. People do what they want and they're free to do  it  and I will not stop them, just don't ask me to accept that their idea of  it  is the same as my idea of  it . The word  ""it""  can apply to many things, for example my idea of fun is going to a nightclub, others think it's fun to put a cat into a bag and hit the bag with a baseball bat...
",0
"Well, let's go with that example. You don't consider an old man marrying a young woman to be a real marriage, yet legally it is still considered as such. Society hasn't collapsed despite the fact that the legal definition of marriage doesn't square with your personal definition. Thus you have proven that having a legal definition be slightly different from society's definition is no big deal.
",1
"Yes, it's no big deal as in the world won't end or society won't collapse like you said, but that's the same as a waiter bringing me an orange juice (OJ) when I asked him for a lemonade and explain to me that it's the same and it's no big deal. I mean it's a drink and it'll quench my thirst, hell it even has a similar citrusy quality, but it's not lemondade so it shouldn't be called lemondade.  .  A marriage is a bit more important than a drink and when it comes to marriage, I do actually want my children to grow up with the same idea of marriage as mine. This is because my goal is to watch them eventually find a suitable partner, love each other forever and bear me grandchildren, etc.. I suspect that lots of other people feel the same way, and even though things do not always turn out as perfectly as we would like, the goal should not shift. Changing the definition of the word marriage is the first step away from that goal. Sure the children will find their own ways and decide what marriage is by themselves and everything like that, and I may not have much input into the process, but  if they should ever need guidence in their lives  (and I'm sure that we all do sometime in our lives) they can come to me, and I'd guide them accordingly and I'd have a legal backup. In terms of the word marriage, I re-assert my view that its definition should even be more narrow than it is currently. Old men and young women should not be included.  .  Now, people can drink OJ and call it lemonade if they want (in Vietnam they call a cheese sandwich: ""hotdog""), I fully respect that, but I don't think that the definition of lemondade should change. I respect people's choices :) and they can do what they like amongst themselves.

You can just tell your kids, ""Legally it's a contract between two people, but if you ask me, it's a union between a man and a woman done for the purpose of raising children.""

I'm not advocating that we stop gay unions. How can we? It's love right? You can't stop love! Perhaps we should move on to discuss the specific rights of a married couple  vs  those of united gay couples, see where there might be discrepancies and why they exist, and adjust it if there's no good reasons for them.

This is so obvious I can't believe I actually have to state it explicitly: A gay person would want to marry someone of their own sex, whereas a straight person would want to marry someone of the opposite sex. Therefore, in terms of ability to marry  who they want , gays do not have the same rights as straight people.  Yes, civil unions would be better than nothing.

Oh wait, were is that gene? what they can't find it! darn.  By making this argument you deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul).

"To put it another way, marriages are what societies are made of just like bricks are what buildings are made of.   You could still have society without marriage. And even if that weren't true, expanding the legal definition of marriage to allow for gays would not be a radical change. More akin to changing the texture of the bricks.   doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.   Was enforcing racial integration tyranny? No. There are times when tolerance is justified and times when it is not.   You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent.   No, I don't. But I think there are important similarities. Both skin color and sexual orientation are things that are part of ones identity. They cannot be changed. Neither makes a person inferior. Discrimination on the basis of either is logically unsound.   Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone.   Again they are not the same, just similar. But saying homosexuality is a behavior is being intentionally misleading. It's like saying shouting is ""just a behavior"" and therefore people should repress their anger at all times. It's completely impractical and utterly disconnected from reality.   You wouldn't say it's a good thing?   I was referring to homosexuality, not gay marriage. Being gay is neither good nor bad, it's neutral. Gay marriage, on the other hand,  is good , because it shows acceptance of behavior for which we should be showing acceptance.   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives.   Oh, wow, that's a pretty hardcore view. How is homosexuality anywhere near as bad as theft or murder? All I see is two people having sex. No harm done.   Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good.   Agreed. But gay sex is not one of them.   Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Hahaha. You're a funny guy.   Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   Well, they  are  born gay and they  can't  change, so that's just telling them the truth.

Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.    Homosexuality is not a behavior, it's a sexual orientation. Gay sex is the behavior. We can and should repress bad behaviors, but gay sex is not a behavior bad enough to warrant repression.   you...deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul)   Morality does not come from anything supernatural.

"As you say, ""Marriage is something in particular."" Its a legal union requiring a license from a government office, not from a religious organization.

"You don't need a piece of paper to define your happiness. However, you do need a piece of paper -- and be straight -- to be eligible for the considerable financial benefits given to married people. Same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships in the U.S. do not have 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.  When African Americans turned to the courts to help protect their constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of any kind deprived African Americans of equal protection. Gay Americans also want the same rights, benefits and protections provided to all other Americans.  Denying gay partners the full benefits otherwise granted to same sex partners is saying that gay individuals and same-sex couples are “second-class citizens” who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, heterosexual individuals or opposite-sex couples.  On this basis, several state courts have decided it was illegal to deny same sex couples the right to marry. So, the question is not ""should Gay marriage be legal in the United State of America?"" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in a discriminatory way toward same sex couples. Obviously, the answer is ""No"".

Oh yeah, make the connection to civil rights (even though it really isn't the same thing at all. All I will be going after is benefits, not equal protection under the law, but what the heck).   Let's see, what else? Oh yeah, claim that denying me farm subsidies makes me a ""second-class citizen"" who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, farmers. This is good stuff ;)  So, the question is not ""should farm subsidies be legal in the United State of America?"" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in a discriminatory way towards non farmers. Obviously, the answer is ""No"".  This is easy! Why didn't I think of this before? ;)  But you know, it might be easier to just go after the benefits and maybe try to force the government to stop using the word marriage. That way you'll only have the government to deal with, not the government AND the religious right.   The gay community is fighting two fronts. Make peace with the religious right, let them have ""their"" ""marriage"" word and go after the government. Not because letting the religious right have ""their"" ""marriage"" word is the right thing to do but because it will expedite the gay community's access to ""marriage"" benefits.

"""so when the government gives away farm subsidies then they are actually discriminating against me and violating my civil rights because they don't subsidize me.""  The Supreme Court of the United States has determined that the right to marry the person of any race is fundamental. They have not so ruled about your right to a farm subsidy. But you are free to go ask them if you like.  International law has determined that the right to marry is fundamental. They have not so ruled about your right to a farm subsidy. But you are free to go ask them if you like.  The"" ""marriage"" word is on the licenses issued by civil authorities. I see no need to remove the word from them. However, there is a need to extend equal protection under the law to same-sex couples who choice to get married.

"Oh there it is again, that arbitrary standard of consent.   It's not that arbitrary, since consent is already defined in law. And the very basic requirement of a marriage is that there are at least two consenting parties involved.   If I could demonstrate that my cat loves me it could be proven that on some level the cat consents because it doesn't run away when I show it love, therefore, we should get married.   Well, homosexuals can make that claim (though I'm absolutely positive that you're oversimplifying their case) because the issue of consent is both de facto and de jure. It's already assumed as a matter of ritual and law. Showing that you love each other is one thing, but not running away is not a form of legitimate consent, since consent is not a passive action, but an active one. It requires that there is a fulfilling of some verbal criteria, whether written or spoken, and it has to be initiated within the strictures of the ritual.   If love and consent equals marriage all I have to do is demonstrate that my relationships posses those two qualities and I should be able to marry the object of my affection.   There are a lot of ""ifs"" in your argument. But you're also skewing the legal definition of ""consent"" to make a weak point. Within the strictures of marriage, express consent is required. This means that a personhood of adequate intelligence can make a reasoned decision in response to the prompting or initiations of another and  come to accord  with said proposal. Your cat can't do that. Now, if you're actually willing to take the time to demonstrate that your cat is capable of such faculties, then you have a case. Until then, you're blowing hot air.   To oppose me you would have to invoke another standard.   No. I don't.

"No contradiction. let me rephrase what you said so as to clear up the confusion;    Their lifestyle robs them of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.    If they want to do that fine. No one is saying homosexuals can't, they're free to form relationships, set up housekeeping and whatever their relationship demands.  What we are saying is if that's what you want to do fine, but don't ask us the American people to support you in that decision. Our Government was established to support Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Anything that works against those goals, like homosexuality, is well, against it and not in support of it. It's their choice that denies them these things, not the lack of our support of that choice. Or to put it another way, We are against it, homosexuality, because we want them to have these things, not because we want to deny it to them. Hence no contradiction  In regards the abolition of the things you mentioned. One of the purposes of government is to promote the common good. If those things aren't good for society then government shouldn't promote them and should in fact work to discourage them. Will people still do those things? you bet they will.

"Thanks for making my point. Your argument is a good example of trying to define marriage. You said ""Marriage is a contract"" it may be true that most marriages have some form of a contract but that is just a formality and not the marriage. A contract defines the parameters of something that exist independent of the contract; it doesn't make the thing. See this is were we get into trouble, when we try to define the nature of something. Because the nature of the object is defined by itself, not the subject. For example lets say I wanted to define you and I said; ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply; no I'm not, I'm a.... See I would do better in describing you as you actually are. So it is with marriage, we need to describe it as it actually is, not what we think it is. And historically speaking marriage has almost always been seen has the joining of male and female for procreation. Which leads us to the next question.  ""When two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners?""  In the case of marriage it's because they normally produce kids. Why does that matter to the state? consider the following report;  http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/docs/                                        costofdivorce.pdf    So yes, this type of relationship is of serious concern for government and they would be wise to do everything they can to support and encourage it. And primarily because marriages produce the next generation.  You said"" The human spirit should be without bonds"" this pernicious little lie has been the root of all kinds of human evil, not to mention the question of this debate. People doing what ever they want without restraint is anarchy and detrimental to society, it's why we have laws. If we are going to flourish some restraint is necessary. But let me ask you, what is more creative and productive, the undisciplined mind or the disciplined mind? Before you respond let me remind you of your education that allows you to read and write, with out which you couldn't have this debate.  Final thought. You said ""Don't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect."" Heterosexual couples typically reproduce and homosexual couples never do. How is that the same effect and how does this avoid being a contradiction since you say ""A"" is the same as ""non-A""

For example. Say female hormones are x's and male hormones are P's well if a male and a male are interested in each other the male produces more x's then p's. Nothing wrong with it, it's normal and it human. Nobody is born perfect and nobody is born flawless. If a man and a women are together awesome! if a women and a women are together great! if a man and a man are together then at least they can act like more of a man then most straight guys can. They aren't afraid of people who are against them they just want to be happy and go for it.

"No you misunderstand what I said I meant that there is nothing wrong with being different and that its normal to have problems either mental of physically and nobody needs shots of any hormones.

So like I said stop paying attention to those really stupid details... you're obviously one of those ass hole guys who find it ok for two women to make out and two men can't.

"Homosexuality or, gender disorientation is a mental condition. Weather it be environmental, or genetic, because someone feels as if a specific kind of behavior is ""natural"" does not make it so. I know I am going to get some blowback from people saying it was removed from the DSM and you are right, however the facts show that this was done under extreme political pressure and not because doctors dont believe that it is in fact a condition.   You would not help a schizophrenic individual by giving them two cups of tea, one for them and one for their imaginary friend, so why then would you support two men or women getting married? This is what I dont understand. Can homosexuality be treated, maybe. Can it be studied, not objectively as Homosexuals dont want to be fixed they want to be accepted which I completely understand. However, you can accept the behavior without condoning it and this is what America is saying. Yes, you are free to do what you want, but we do not recognize it as being healthy and no, we will not legitimize it by recognizing it through one of our most wildly held social traditions. I believe society as a whole has this right and its important that we do.   On a separate note, I dont think the state should have anything to do with making laws with regards to marriage or recognizing them, however I stand by my original premise that at least attempting to correct the behavior is better than condoning it.

"What constitutes a pathology? And how does a mental pathology differ from an organic pathology? The DSM in some ways is not only a diagnostic instrument; it is a research tool in which clinicians systematically identify areas of concern in patients lives related to mental functioning, and this is a relationship that cannot be easily detached in theory or reality. Some of these broad categories, then, are just that -- they are useful analytical tools, but they are not necessarily 1:1::theory:reality the same thing as a real disease. We may find one day (assuming this example for the argument) that Autism is not one disease but multiple, perhaps independent, ""pathogenic"" sources affecting a conglomeration of people who (1) meet the classification due to mostly environmental reasons such as metal poisoning, or (2) meet the classification generally due to a biological reason with both a genetic and environmental cofactor, and perhaps (3) some amount of people who simply represent the statistical extremes of normal human variation. The above example is dry, but the implications are important to what you are saying, because you take the DSM as a supreme way of describing expert opinion on what is pathological (except for when it is corrupted by politicians), when the DSM doubles both as a clinical tool and a research tool.  Also, if you don't trust the DSM IV-TR of current time (because of political powers interfering with the DSM revision process), and you also now believe that research material can be politically influenced (it's fair to say it can, though we must also be concerned with scope and magnitude), what research material are you going to have us trust that also coincidentally supports your argument about how homosexuality is pathological?  Do you anticipate a reversing trend in psychological and medical journals where authors are persuaded that homosexuality is a pathology?

"See this is were we get into trouble, when we try to define the nature of something. Because the nature of the object is defined by itself, not the subject.   This is true, but while the nature of an object may be objective, the definition of a  word  is very much a matter for the subject.   For example lets say I wanted to define you and I said; ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply; no I'm not, I'm a.... See I would do better in describing you as you actually are. So it is with marriage, we need to describe it as it actually is, not what we think it is.   You're conflating defining and describing. An object is described, while a word is defined. For an object, it is possible to ascertain by inspection whether or not a given  description  matches the object. For a word, however, it is necessary to establish the word's  definition  as an axiom—there is no manner in which is can be deduced.  What you're doing here is describing a specific marriage (or collection of marriages; possibly even every marriage you've ever encountered) as ""a joining of male and female for procreation"" and then turning around and declaring that this must be the  definition  of marriage. But that is no more a valid conclusion than describing a specific animal (or collection of animals; possibly even every animal you've ever encountered) as ""a large, greyish thing with a trunk"" and then trying to use that as the definition of animal. In fact the most we can say is that  if  the description is accurate (ie, if the collection of animals are in fact large, greyish things with trunks), then the description establishes a subset of things which are animals. Similarly, given that there are marriages which can be described as ""a joining of male and female for procreation"", then the most we can say is that this description establishes a subset of things which are marriages. In and of itself this does not rule out the possibility of other things which are marriages.  Now, one is perfectly free to  subjectively  restrict their definitions to the subset under consideration, as an axiom, but there is nothing intrinsic to the subset which requires this, and nothing which forces others to agree with what amounts to an entirely arbitrary decision on your part. All that you've done in choosing that particular subset is declare that anything else isn't a marriage  by your definition , which reveals the debate for what it (like so many others) really is—an argument over whether your arbitrary definition is somehow  less  arbitrary than anyone else's definition.

"Guess what? Marriage is a ""civil union"".   In order to get married, you need a license from a government office. You can't get it from a religious organization. That makes marriage a civil matter.  The meaning of ""civil"" in this situation is ""of or pertaining to civil law"". Civil law is ""the body of laws of a state or nation regulating ordinary private matters, as distinct from laws regulating criminal, political, or military matters.""  One definition of ""union"" is ""the act of uniting or an instance of being united in marriage"". As I said, marriage is a civil union.   So people who want gays to be able to form civil unions are in effect supporting gay marriage.  However same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships in the U.S. do not have 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.   When African Americans turned to the courts to help protect their constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of any kind deprived African Americans of equal protection. Gay Americans also want the same rights, benefits and protections provided to all other Americans.  Denying gay partners the full benfits otherwise granted to same sex partners is saying that gay individuals and same-sex couples are “second-class citizens” who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, heterosexual individuals or opposite-sex couples.  On this basis, several state courts have decided it was illegal to deny same sex couples the right to marry. So, the question is not ""should Gay marrige be legal in the United State of America?"" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in an illegal way toward same sex couples. Obviously, the answer is ""No"".

"I have been in a same sex relationship for 12 yrs and have been legally recognized in New Jersy only by a civil union which has limited benefits in comparison to heterosexual marrige. My partner and I have 2 babies that we love very much. I believe that we should have the same rights as an heterosexual couple.   Same sex couples are allowed to adopt and we are singled out by the US as gay parents and our children are also being discriminated against by NOT giving us the full benefits of marrige. I believe that our children should be recognized as being part of a family. A family is love and who in the hell has the right to say who and what anyone can love. You are taking our right to love away.   The children of same sex families need to feel equal and same sex couples need equality so that we can feel secured as an American Family shoud. We are not asking for anything more than what anyone else has. We are not asking for special privledges. We just want to be treated equally.   Our children have the right to have a sence of belonging without any predjudices. We pay taxes, we are your Doctors, teachers , police officers, servicemen, freinds, neighbors, brothers, sisters, Mothers, Fathers, Bankers, and some of us are even in the military protecting this country!!! We are everywhere and we are not going away. We are only coming out stronger and in more numbers. Hiding in the closet is not an option any longer!  We as Americans desearve equality!!!!  I have one question: If we are not able to recieve full equal benefits of marrige(ie.. survivor benefits), would it be correct to say that we should be exempt from paying taxes since this does not benefit the gay communtiy. I mean come on, why should we pay into social security if we are not able to cash in on our full benefits? Mabey we should get a tax break?? i guess our gay money is good enough to take but we, as gay americans are not worthy to have it work for us when we need it!!!   The worst thing about this is that the federal government is judging us and if I remeber correctly, GOD is the only one to judge me! Rememeber , GOD made us equal and in his vision.

"We just want to be treated equally.    But your not the same kind of a relationship, isn't that why you refer to yourself as a ""same sex relationship"" and not a heterosexual marriage? Aren't you the one and not the other?   Our children have the right to have a sense of belonging without any prejudices   You are the one who denied them that by your choice, not us. Are you not comfortable with choice you made? Our choices have consequences. If you made the choice I would assume you thought through the ramifications and were willing to accept the consequences. Otherwise you would have chosen differently. Why then must we accept the consequences for you? It's your choice not ours.   GOD made us equal and in his vision.   Not quite, in one sense He did and in one sense He didn't. We know that due to the fact we are all different, some people are just smarter than others. He did however create us all in His Image, But that image has been shattered and distorted by sin. The fact that homosexuality doesn't show up till after the fall ought to tell us something. And don't tell me there was no fall because I see the effects of it every day and I battle against my own inner corruption daily.   Ephesians 2  By Grace Through Faith   And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.   But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

"It is our right! We the people of the United States! There is nothing in the constitution about gay marriage, so we can do it. Then Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, banning all gay marriages. Republican Chris Christie of New Jersey (A blue state), vetoed that would have allowed gay marriage and will let the people vote in December. On another note, it is now fine in Maryland, N.H., N.Y, and after Prop. 8 was banned, in California.

"Yes!!  People have no control over who they fall in love with, male or female. It is wrong for gay marriage to be illegal because it's like trying o control people's feelings and feelings can't be controlled.

"""if every couple in the known world for say went homosexual humans would thereby go extinct""  Right, and if every couple in the known world went to the movies, humans would thereby go extinct. Because, you know you can't have sex at the movies. Especially when it would be so crowded in the theater.  But I think you are on to something here. If people have same-sex relationships BUT don't make it a legal union, THEN the human race will be saved. But once we let one same-sex couple get married, then everyone will go gay!  For example, in the state of MA -- can't find any heterosexuals in that state now. Even the state Senator posed nude, which is, of course, gay gay gay. Damn that MA. The human race is now doomed.

As far as civil unions, I think it's a good first step (many states don't recognize  any  union between homosexuals) but separate but equal, is inherently unequal, and marriage is a fundamental right (this isn't my opinion, but was decided unanimously by the supreme court).

It's really simple actually.   An implication of Brown vs the Board of Education, and subsequent integration laws, permitted precedent for Lovings vs Virginia as an addendum to Brown, amending the definition of marriage, institutionally, to include interracial coupling, as a matter of civil rights. Your point, as simple as it is, holds no weight. Lovings vs Virginia effectively trumps you.   Why does a different name make something un-equal?   You can't argue that people or institutions are equal and then legally, and definitionally prohibit one group from participating in the rits of another group. That's not equal. If people are on equal ground, then segregating their practices and institutions contradicts that equity. If they are equal, then there's no reason at all to segregate.

Please see miscegenation case law: Lovings v Virginia, which overturned Pace v Alabama.   If the state issues a license, gives tax incentives, sets up family courts and all the other benefits they extend; I think I would consider that involvemnt.   And thus, it is the business of the government to ultimately ensure that homosexuals can marry as well. If you think otherwise, you're merely arguing ""separate but equal"", which was found to be unconstitutional as a direct consequence of Brown v Board of Education.

"Guess what? Marriage is a ""civil union"".   In order to get married, you need a license from a government office. You can't get it from a religious organization. That makes marriage a civil matter.  The meaning of ""civil"" in this situation is ""of or pertaining to civil law"". Civil law is ""the body of laws of a state or nation regulating ordinary private matters, as distinct from laws regulating criminal, political, or military matters.""  One definition of ""union"" is ""the act of uniting or an instance of being united in marriage"". As I said, marriage is a civil union.

"Gay people should get their own thing? I agree. In support, can anyone provide a very good reason as to why black people should have gotten their own kind of marriage? That is also what you liberals would call an ""arbitrary"" or ""capricious"" distinction.  Quite simply people of different races do not get together and they should ""get their own thing"". There's nothing wrong with the name Mixed Union when they are given the same legal entitlements as marriage (pure-race unions, or clean-marriages, of better defined as those marriages which are in keeping with our honourable forefathers of America).  Marriage is a precious institution of our society and only recently in the history of the US has the mixing of races within this great institution been permitted (research yourself how liberal and ""new"" this Mixed Union concept is). The other Great nations of the past also did not permit such mixings; even S. American nations (which do not count as one of those capital-G ""Great"" nations) until recently made explicit laws making sure that those Mixers would GET THEIR OWN THING instead of muddying up the definition of marriage. As other people later put it, and quite logically put it, 1+1 IS NOT 3, IT'S 2. THE ANSWER IS 2. Though, of course, one would argue the real answer is to this problem is 42... anyone with me?  1 Latino + 1 Pure Aryan = DOES NOT MAKETH A MARRIAGE; it makes it a Mixed Union entitled to all the same legal protections as marriage. We do make this extremely precious and important distinction because nowadays our dictionaries are getting muddied with upstart liberal ideas (my god, they want to redefine sexuality and say that men have sex with men... and the women, the pure women as well! it's just inconceivable). For the sacred, time-honored tradition of protecting our dictionaries, we make that important legal distinction.  Yes, that's exactly why we are so passionate about arguing for the non-arbitrary distinction between real marriage and Mixed Unions. We are concerned that 1+1 is not 3, and we are also concerned about the muddying of our dictionaries. And since Mixed Unions have the same legal entitlements as real marriages, my lawyer told me that it does not constitute discrimination and that those liberals are likely to fail at a challenge in the courts. Suckers! Shoulda hired better lawyers, you Mixers!  Oh wait, we're talking about those gay people. Yeah, suckers, you Civil Unioners. I won't call you by your real name, but you know what name I'm thinking for you when I think of you... you non-marriage Unioners!  Separate but equal is just as equal as surely as 2 = 2 or x = x.  btw, with more convincing logic, if a = b and b = x, then a = x. See? Different, yet equal. wow. just wow.

"The original definition of marriage does have something to do with race in US legal history, in Mexican history, and in European history. So?

"Words are very powerful Jessald. Try walking into a crowded room and yelling fire, or walk through Watts, Los Angeles and yell out the ""n"" word.   Homosexuality is an act of gay sex, not gay love. Two men or women can love each other and not engage in gay sex. I have many male friends I have known for a long time that I love very deeply however I am not sexually attracted to them.   Men sexually attracted to other men and vice versa is a type of sexual disorientation. It happens all throughout the world in many different species however humans have the ability to correct behavior as apposed to the animal kingdom which is in some ways what makes us stand out. It can be the result of childhood or adult trauma, genetic hormonal imbalance's, environmental variables, the list is endless.

"For those who are against same-sex marriage, I dare you to give one RATIONAL reason why it shouldn't be allowed. Without brawling biblical recitings.  If you say they can't because you say ""It was not adam and steve"", you have no point. Adam and eve were not married at the first place. So the fact that they were a male and a female, is a worthless point. It has nothing to do with marriage. If you believe in that story, consider that they have 2 sons, and still they are the beginning of mankind. Hallo incest!  I myself don't believe in the bible, so I don't care what it says anyways.  If you start brawling about Leviticus, you should think then that, in god's opinion, all sins are equal. In the bible, eating shrimps is a sin...  If you say that it shouldn't be allowed because they can't produce any offspring, you have no point either. If you claim that, well you should also forbid straight marriages with no offspring... I think gay marriages would let the divorce-rates go down, what about that then.  There is scientific proof, some animals have a gay lifestyle. And animals don't have a conscience or can't reason. Therefor being gay isn't a choice.   I truly believe that marriage is about love en caring between two loving beings. If they can express that, they should be married. No one could stand in their way with a rational reason.  And I am sure that evolution will ensure that close-mindness will be abandoned.

"In short, yes, gay marriage should be allowed. If marriage between a man and a woman is legal (as well as intermarriage) then why should it not be allowed between those of the same sex?   Those who argue that it shouldn't be allowed because marriage is of a particular religion that forbids anyone being gay then they should also agree that marriage should therefore have nothing to do with being a legal matter in which a couple gets benefits from getting married such as in the areas of medical, taxes, death, and more. If gay couples can't receive these rights, then no one else should. Everyone should therefore be reduced to what many gays have to due now and just have a ceremonoly marriage with no legal benefits.   Also those who are against it due to their religion need to realize that whether or not it is against their religion or not, that has nothing to do with it because ,last I checked, my country has the freedom of religion, meaning not everyone has to follow what one person believes. And in all honestly, a gay marriage will ,in the most, not affect the said person any more then it does now.   Another point people agrue is that gay marriage will lead to and allow what is not traditionally thought of as a family and to many, this is unacceptable. And to those people, I say that the traditional family of a mother and father has already become less popular then it was a even a few decades ago. In today's world, there are many forms of what is now considered a ""family"". There are those who are raised with only a single parent, those who are divorced, those who were born from a seregate and raised by a different couple, ect, are only a few examples. People need to realize that times change and that a major change is happening now whether they agree with it or not.  In the end, I believe gay marriage should be allowed with all the legal rights and benefits that a marriage between a man and a woman have and those who think otherwise are basicly just discriminating against what is different from themselves. Eventually gay marriage will be legallize just as intermarriage has been and future generations will look down upon those who are against gay marriage now as we look down upon those who disagreed with intermarriage. Simple as that.

The problem is that people don't wan't people telling them that they can't vote based on their religious beliefs. I believe that homosexuallity is morally wrong and I don't want it in my country. I'm not alone. There is nothing you can do about it and you can't change my mind.   Prop 8 passed. Do you have a problem with democracy? Move somewhere els.   You and people like you and all of Hollywood are trying to beat the majority of American citizens. Trying to sway everyone. That's not good. History shows that. The few being in control is a bad thing.    "" Two people you don't know getting married doesn't effect you at all! ""   So I'm only allowed to vote and have opinions on tings that effect me personally? You don't think I should? That's to bad.

"Let me put this to you in a way that you can understand.  Let's say for dinner tonight you want to eat chicken. Instead of you choosing to eat your chicken however, your entire state, including the millions of people who have never met you and will never meet you, vote on what you eat for dinner. Turns out the majority of Texans prefer steak. Are you upset? Well maybe you just have a problem with democracy.   I believe that homosexuallity is morally wrong and I don't want it in my country.

(In case you didn't get it, I'm being a sarcastic dick here).  5. Do you disagree with my analogy? You said that you want homosexuals to leave, and you called them immoral.   Take a look at this  story  about the kkk boycotting halmark because they began making same sex wedding cards. They disagreed with how America was being multiculturalised (they're words not mine).  Obviously I am not accusing you of lynching black people, or using terrorism, but what I do want you to understand is that the bigotry and intolerance for those different from yourself is equally comparable. I know that your immediate reaction is to take offense to this statement, but know that the only reason that there appears to be a difference between your problem with homosexuals and the racism that used to exist (and in some places still exists) in America is that the former is more socially acceptable.  Trust me Jake I know. Gays are considered icky. ""Dude, don't be gay"" or ""what are you a faggot?"" are common because being homosexual is socially unacceptable among many people. I'm probably guilty of using similar phrases myself, and I'm not proud of that fact. What I desperately want you to understand is that homosexuality is not a lifestyle choice. Some people are  born  different, and if we shun them for being different, make fun of them, and convince them that the feelings that they have are immoral, then we really are no better then the racists of our past.  You claim homosexuality to be immoral. When I attack this point, you hide behind a Bible and complain about me attacking your opinions. Then when I argue that there are numerous acts that the Bible considers immoral, but yet you choose to ignore, you say something along the lines of,  well obviously that stuff isn't immoral , and I would agree. There is nothing immoral about touching pigskin, or eating shellfish. However, unless you can differentiate between these actions and homosexuality then you are merely cherrypicking from the Bible what you want to believe.  So now, Jake, I must ask you for what is probably the twentieth time: what makes homosexuality immoral? Please do not use the argument that lots of people agree with you...we can both see how that is not a valid argument. Also, I must ask you not to respond: ""that's just my opinion"" because that is not even a position. We must have reasons for our opinions, and those reasons must make sense, otherwise we are deluding ourselves.  I look forward to your response.

"I don't think the religious world should have to alter their views on gay marriage at all. I think they should ignore it entirely. I don't think religions are outdated either. Christianity, for example, is based on worshiping a God who sent his  son  (male) to Earth and his  son  picked 12  men , the apostles to be his advocates. There were many more prominent men in the Bible, not because of today's society, but because men were higher than women in that time period. The time period has influenced many practices that remain today. Well that was a nice little side-track from the debate topic. :)

"1 & 2. You contradict yourself. You write off the meat is murder crowd as foolish, and then go on to say that ""Eating steak isn't morally wrong, so that's not a very good example."" Although I agree that eating steak isn't morally wrong, clearly there are some people who believe it is. Should these people have the right to stop you from eating steak? Should you have the right to stop homosexuals from doing what they do? The answer to both these questions is no.  3.  There are plenty of other good people who don't support gay marriage.   Just like there were plenty of other  good  people who were against womens suffrage or the civil rights movement or even slavery. Your point only shows that it;s socially acceptable to oppose rights for homosexuals, not that its right. The point of using the KKK was to try and show you an example of a group that is now infamous for its intolerance.   Who are you quoting? You choose to make crap up that idiots have probably said instead of giving an actual quote from a smart person that is against gay marriage.   It's like arguing with a two year old, I swear!  Listen Jake, the point I was trying make is that it is socially acceptable to discriminate against gays. The quotes I used weren't direct quotes, but were typical of things that males our age might say to each other. I even admitted to saying them myself. I was not trying to accuse you or any other gay marriage opponent of anything, merely to demonstrate what the culture is. Also do not think I am accusing you specifically of saying these things, because I do not know you. In fact it seems very likely that you use this language less then me, if at all.   It's so obvious what you are trying and failing to do.   Clearly not to you.  Once again I am not trying to paint a stereotype...I am telling you what  all  kids are age say. Not liberals, not conservatives, but males in there teens or early twenties. Do you deny this? Are there not people at your school who use these terms? Let's get off our high horse for two seconds here Jake.   If you read the bible instead of cherrypicking quotes out of the book out of context then we can talk. Or you could just watch the west wing.   Jake, how many times do I have to tell you? I was raised a Catholic! I go to church  every Sunday , and usually I even pay attention.   In fact I'm pretty sure I have a Bible in my room. Let me go get it....yep here it is (it even still has the bookmarks from my conformation class).   There is a lot of symbolism in the bible that you would not understand.   That's pretty presumptuous Jake. Also pretty hypocritical of someone accusing me of arrogance. But let's ignore this for now.  So Jake, I'm sitting here Bible in hand. Dazzle me with you intellectual superiority. Explain to me why you are right when you claim that homosexuality is a sin, yet those people who justified male superiority though the Bible, and kept women as second class citizens for the majority of human history were wrong. What is the symbolism of saying that a womans menstrual cycle makes here unclean, or that any man who touches her is unclean as well? (Leviticus 15:19-27)  Enlighten me.  Jake, explain to my why the story of genesis is not also symbolic, even though every scientific discovery of the last hundred years has proven it to be false when taken literally.   I believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman, anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred.   Finally a legitimate response. Now we can have an actual discussion.  Are you also for making divorce, premarital sex, adultery, and masturbation illegal as well? Do they not also help to defeat the sanctity of marriage and family?  How do you feel about those studies which that being raised by parents of the same sex has no ill effects on the child? Those same studies show that what tends to hurt children is only having one parent, or in the case of orphans no parents. Would you rather orphans had no parents then two parents of the same sex?  Here is my main question...if you do not deny that homosexuals are born gay, then why would God make them as he did. Why would God intentionally put them in a situation where, if they want to love someone romantically (as a husband loves a wife), they are sinning. What kind of a cruel God would do that?  Jake, clearly homosexuals want to have sex...almost everyone does. You also are of the opinion that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. Why then, would you want to stop homosexuals from making their love and actions more moral?   Is it cool to call yourself a sarcastic dick?   It's called a self effacing joke. Look it up. Your supposed to laugh not get offended (and you complain about PC people getting offended easily,   jeez )

"Most Americans don't what gay marriage to be legal.   With respect to same-sex marriage, it's become an issue of the tyranny of the majority. Surely even you can recognize that there have been a number of movements that overcame the opposition of the majority to become constitutionally bound.   Family - anything that goes against a mother and a father being the only definition of a family is going against the constitution, what this country was founded on and nature.   A large number of animals have homosexuals within their population. Nature has nothing to do with it. Miscegeny was also constitutionally outlawed in the majority of states, and it took a constitutional amendment to allow its practice to be legal. It's not surprising that conservatives have been using the same bloody arguments that you and people like you (oh yeah, conservatives) use with respect to homosexuals and homosexual marriage are nearly the exact same arguments people were using during the days of anti-miscegenation.    We are in every way created to be with the opposite sex.   Which has no bearing on policy. And if it does, it's unconstitutional.   Homosexuality is abnormal.   So is left handedness.   Most people are not gay.   Most people aren't crippled from birth, either, but it doesn't stop us from making legal provisions for their equitable treatment.   It goes against my beliefs.   Of course it does. So what?   And I have a right to those beliefs.   But no right to turn your personal beliefs into policy. That, my friend, is unconstitutional - certainly if it's religious. And if it's just because gays and lesbians, transexuals, and vestites, and bisexuals make you queezy, then you have no legal ground to stand on either.   As far as I'm concerned, it's just a matter of time. I wish we had another ""Why We Can't Wait"" to read so we can all see the absolutely obtuse, ridiculousness of opposing progressive marriage reform. These antiquated religious and social mores are getting rather silly.

"Ok now, and read my whole argument and read it twice befroe you comment; gay, CHRISTIAN marriages should not be allowed.

So here remains the issue; the Christians are upset because the homosexual community is FORCING, and not just by judicial means, their beliefs of unity onto another private party. It is written by the way in the most used from of the bible that it is an absolute sin to propose, follow threw, or allow a marriage of the same two sex's.   Keep in mind that i am not christian, but follow a similar religion that, while against the order of unnatural ethics, am for the furthering of the bondage of souls, and also believe that every soul finds it's way into each beast and its sex's.

"Heterosexual marriage laws the ground work for a relationship that creates and raises children. (sperm + egg). Now, the goverment gives many benefits economically, tax wise, etc to married couples. [2] The reason they only give them to traditional couples is because of their ability to procreate. Having children is the only way to continue society and advance our culture and race. As the heterosexual couples are the only people who can advance society in this way, and well pay back the benefits they get through marriage, then they deserve a state recognition. The goverment makes laws based of of interests, and their interest in this case is procreation. Therefore allowing gay marriage would be unjust as it debars the special recognition the heterosexual couples deserve.  People who are pro gay marriage usually have the claims that marriage is about love, but this is far from true. If marriage is about love, then why is the state involved? They are involved due to some sort of interest. If the goverment cared about love, then they would attempt to regulate and control friendships or non marital relationships.  The reason they regulate marriage over these other relationships is because marriage is where you are meant to produce a larger workforce. The reason they do not regulate other relationships is because they have no good reason to do so, at all.  The goverment in marriage needs two things: 1) legal commitment, 2) procreation and the ability to raise a child. A boyfriend girlfriend relationship may produce offspring in the process, but as they are not legally binding situation it is easier for them to break apart, and they will not be able to raise the child. A homosexual relationship will be lacking the legal bind, and the ability to produce offspring. Even if we did give them a legal bind, they would not be able to create children therefore not fulfilling the states interest fully.  One argument used against the procreation argument is the infertile argument. This objection is a misunderstood rebuttal, they do not understand the debate at point. The argument is not fully based of of the ability to reproduce, but rather a type of relationship in which procreation is possible to start off. It is not an argument fully based of of the argument they can make kids, but also an argument based of of the ability to have the similar effect, a procreative type union.  My opponent without a doubt will start to argue as marriage has benefits isn't it fair homosexuals receive them too? Any society, goverment, or institution that distinguishes marriage in a certain way will prohibit some types of marriage. A prohibition of SSM does not violate the equal protection clause as we must first have a definition of what marriage is. You cannot confirm that a SSM ban is unconstitutional unless we determine exactly what marriage is, and what it is for. [3]  It is only unconstitutional if they are unjustly debarred the right. Ex: Is it unconstitutional if we debar a murderer from a gun? No. That is a just cause, and with my secular case against gay marriage I have proven they are justly debarred the right. By saying it is unconstitutional you are saying it discriminates without just cause, and that this group deserves the right. As murderers do not deserve a right to a gun, then it is constitutional. In the states eyes homosexual couples cannot produce offspring therefore do not fulfill states interest, and do not deserve the right.  Just because something may have inherent good effects does not mean they deserve the legal benefits. The challenge to my opponent, and the argument he needs to press is: What are the states interest in giving these couples rights? If the State has no reason to give you benefits then why should they? Marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, and no one else, and the states interest is in a procreative type relationship, a gay couple does not entitle to these benefits.  Last statement:  1."" Heterosexual union is the indispensable means by which humans come into existence and therefore has special social value (indeed, the greatest possible social value because it is the first precondition for society).  2. The indispensable means by which something of special social value can occur itself has special value.  3. What has special value to human society deserves special social recognition and sanction.  4. Civil ordinances which recognize gay marriage as comparable to heterosexual marriage constitute a rejection of the special value of heterosexual unions.  5. To deny the special social value of what has special social value is unjust.  6. Therefore, gay marriage is unjust.""[1]   http://wisdomandfollyblog. com/2008/10/02/ an-argument-against-gay-marriage/     http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/ marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html    Sherif Girgis, Robert P.

"Firstly:  Gay relationships:  The majority of gay relationships last shorter then 6 months. (1)  Very few gay relationships surpas 2 years. (2)  Only 2.7% of gays have 1 partner throughout their whole life. (3)  One study says they have 8 sexual partners per year. (4)  Another said they have 500-1000 throughout their whole life. (5)  Why should these rights be granted?   The goverment has no reason to grant these benefits. The goverment wants procreative type unions. (6)  Now, there are many economic benefits the goverment gives marriage, so this indicates they do this for certain goals they wish to accomplish, their goal: procreative type unions with child rearing. (6) as homosexuals cannot do this they fail.  Discrimination:  A common argument, and one that will likely be stated, is that banning SSM is discrimination. Actually, as marriage is about procreative type relationships then it isn't discrimination based off of sexuality, but rather nature. (7, 8) and have a procreative type relationship. As Homosexuals can never produce children and/or have a procreative type relationship, then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature. (7, 8) Marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female + children. As marriage is a large part of this culture, banning SSM is popular to common marriage stereotypes. (7, 8)   Further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right, as discrimination to a privilege is just. (7,8) Aristotle saw this as what you deserved, not what is given.

The goverment wants procreative type unions.""  if you want to live in a society that only lets us get to do stuff that benefits them, then why don't we go all the way, live, and sleep where they want, eat what, and when they want, to condition us to do what they want, since everything is about thier benefit.  ""The goverment has no reason to grant these benefits. The goverment wants procreative type unions.""  only being able to do it with who they want sounds awfully close to the image i'v painted above... what about peope that can't have kids? since we can't benefit off thier love, why should allow them to love?  ""Now, there are many economic benefits the goverment gives marriage, so this indicates they do this for certain goals they wish to accomplish, their goal: procreative type unions with child rearing. (6) as homosexuals cannot do this they fail.""  there are economic benefits yes, do you honestly believe that people only marry so that the government can pay them to have offspring? im sorry i would get married regardless if i was getting paid for it, and we shouldn't only be allowed to marry if it benefits them and not especially just because they are paying us to.  ""A common argument, and one that will likely be stated, is that banning SSM is discrimination. Actually, as marriage is about procreative type relationships then it isn't discrimination based off of sexuality, but rather nature. (7, 8) and have a procreative type relationship.""  defign nature? nature on an objective level is everything, and if we only do things in the name of nature than whats with all this technology, buildings, and artificial crap we humans have laying around? saying something is unnatural is as convincing as saying something is ""bad"". people don't know how trite the word ""nature"" really is, nature can be defigned as anything. therefore banning marriage for two people because YOU deem it unnatural is discrimination, and prejudice.  ""As Homosexuals can never produce children and/or have a procreative type relationship, then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature.""  you can argue that we have the capabilities of sex in order to reproduce. however I don't see how homosexuality is hurting nature, and even though they can't do what through sex what sex is naturally there for, they're desires and needs are still natural and therefore is natural for them to pursue it.  ""Marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female + children. As marriage is a large part of this culture, banning SSM is popular to common marriage stereotypes. (7, 8)""  yes to an extent, that is the first thing we think of when we think of marriage because marriage is about love and since heterosexuality is the norm, then when we think about love we automatically associate it with men and women. marriage is in culture more seen as a loving commitment, therefore if two people love each other, then isn't them marrying just part of the culture?  ""Further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right, as discrimination to a privilege is just.""  how can you believe that two people loving each other is not a right but something we just let them do? we are not allowed to love whoever we want?  ""As you must prove in the states eyes they deserve this ritual/legal ""right"" then my argument on rights is void, if you cannot prove in the states eyes they deserve this then you have lost.""  I do agree. that right or wrong in society is vague therefore we need to have it legalized in order for it to be allowed but that is only because we can't simply say that ""whatever doesn't harm anyone else is allowed and does harm others is not allowed."" because what harms or doesn't harm is subjective, therefore we created the political system we have in order to try and sort out all of the issues and together decide what is harmful and what isn't. illegalizing the right to love someone is discriminatory due to the fact that they aren't harming anyone, our government is not perfect and if people say that homosexuality is a problem then it will be treated like one, but it is not.

"You claim that the rights should be given   The same rights given to homosexual couples as to heterosexual couples.   Marriages have benefits.   Well, depending on your definition of ""benefits"" (legal or social), this could be a fact or a debatable opinion.   Your reasoning is extend them to be fair, but that's a fallacy: Why should the state give them costly benifits?   1) How is that a fallacy?  2) YOUR refute is a fallacy, a special pleading fallacy. You ask why the state should give them costly benefits, yet you ignore that the state is giving  hetero sexual couples the same costly benefits that we are arguing over with  homo sexual couples. If you wish to point out why the state should give them costly benefits, you surely need to be fair and ask that about ALL groups that ARE given those costly benefits versus the ones you do not think that should.   So what reason is there to allow them union?   They bring no harm and it's not our place to legislate in the affairs of consenting adults wishing to love when no other harmful factors have been proven. The gay couple down the street does not affect or effect my marriage with my husband and if they were to marry, STILL do not alter my marriage.   None!   You haven't refuted any of my statements.   As my last argument proved the state sees marriage as a procreative type union and therefore the government has no reason to allow it.   And what last argument proves that?  You know what? For the shits and giggles of it all, let's pretend you DID indeed prove that the state sees marriage as a procreative type union; why does the state allow infertile  hetero sexual (straight) couples to marry; this includes the elderly, those who choose a surgery which makes them infertile, those who choose not to have kids and those with a disorder that disallows them the ability for procreation? If marriage is about procreation, these groups should not be allowed to marry as well....

"I'd like to know what you define as a ""normal"" mindset. Here's a link to the Child Welfare Information Gateway:  http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/f_gay/ f_gayb.cfm    Children get teased for many reasons. ""Gay and lesbian parents are well aware of the difficulties that a child may face - many have dealt with prejudice all of their lives. Most see it as an opportunity for ongoing discussion that will help their children grow as people.""  According to studies, ""Wendell Ricketts and Roberta Achtenberg, in the article ""Adoption and Foster Parenting for Lesbians and Gay Men: Creating New Traditions in Family"" from Homosexuality and Family Relations, address social workers grappling with the issue by asking, ""...should children be sheltered from every experience in which their difference might challenge prejudice, ignorance, or the status quo (or in which they would be 'exposed' to the difference of others)? Agencies conforming to such a standard must ask themselves whether it is their function to honor the system that generates stigma by upholding its constraints."" They continue, ""Teasing is what children do. Does this mean that child welfare policy must be set at a level no higher than the social interactions of children?""  ""The bulk of evidence to date indicates that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are no more likely to become homosexual than children raised by heterosexuals. As one researcher put it, ""If heterosexual parenting is insufficient to ensure that children will also be heterosexual, then there is no reason to conclude that children of homosexuals also will be gay"". 11  ""Studies asking the children of gay fathers to express their sexual orientation showed the majority of children to be heterosexual, with the proportion of gay offspring similar to that of a random sample of the population. An assessment of more than 300 children born to gay or lesbian parents in 12 different samples shows no evidence of ""significant disturbances of any kind in the development of sexual identity among these individuals"". 12   ""Courts have expressed concern that children raised by gay and lesbian parents may have difficulties with their personal and psychological development, self-esteem, and social and peer relationships. Because of this concern, researchers have focused on children's development in gay and lesbian families.  The studies conclude that children of gay or lesbian parents are no different than their counterparts raised by heterosexual parents. In ""Children of Lesbian and Gay Parents,"" a 1992 article in Child Development, Charlotte Patterson states, ""Despite dire predictions about children based on well-known theories of psychosocial development, and despite the accumulation of a substantial body of research investigating these issues, not a single study has found children of gay or lesbian parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents.""  Psychiatrist Laurintine Fromm, of the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, agrees with that finding. ""[The] literature...does not indicate that these children fare any worse [than those of heterosexual parents] in any area of psychological development or sexual identity formation. A parent's capacity to be respectful and supportive of the child's autonomy and to maintain her own intimate attachments, far outweighs the influence of the parent's sexual orientation alone.""

They are way more open to new situations than adults, and most children these days, and very understanding.

"I wrote a paper a few years back on this topic and I can tell you that everything you state here has no validity. Don't get me wrong, it has points that many make but there are plenty of studies out there that will put you at ease.  First, I would recommend you do a little research on childhood psychology.   Second, adolescent children will at some point become curious in sexual activity and it is the parent's responsibility to inform them appropriately. This comes from a parental unit, regardless of sexual orientation. There are good and bad parents out there and not all will inform their children. My point it that parents are parents and some are good at it; others are bad.   Finally, if you are trying to insinuate that because someones parents are gay they will become gay themselves is ludicrous. I'm sure you're using the ""monkey see, monkey do"" ideology. Let me ask you this, Heterosexual parents have children that are gay so your ideology is flawed.   One last note, on a personal level: What makes you think children will perceive their family as abnormal just on the premise if they're gay? I was proud of my family, my father was overweight and my mother was from Spain (i was made fun of for years on top of having horrible acne in High School). Growing up in a small town almost entirely made up of white republican Catholics, I was abnormal; I knew I was different. Guess what, I'm doing just fine. And I'm not overweight and proud of my dual nationality. If anything it brought about a better sense of self.

"In my own personal opinion being homosexual isn't right and thats it.  And the communites around me doesn't get too involved in homosexual activicties even the government.  It's common to see girls and boys hanging out together but not boys and boys hugging each other touching here an there.  Kids learn from their parents and it's monkey see monkey do. When babies were born, they are weak and they are dependant on their mothers or those whom they think is his/her parents that he/she could relate to. Kids learn from their parents because it's the parents responsiblity to teach their children what is right and what is wrong and not someone elses.  Unless you're trying to prove to me that the parent's role isn't to teach the children what is nature and what is not according to nature etc. you cannot have sex with a man like you did with a woman.  It's impossible unless that man was a woman before a sex change operation and was reluctant to change her organs.  What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature.  Firstly, the environment i grew up in doesn't have too much catholics and christians but mostly made up of other religions. I personally abhor christianity because of its contradictions and it's violation of karma.  One quote i recieved from my friend who is a christian. He was determined to convert me from a buddhist to a christian but once i heard it i brushed him aside.  'If you don't believe in Jesus christ, you shall go to hell'.  This is a total piece of bullshit, who in the world needs to go to hell when he is accumulating merits here and there is no such thing as absolute creator god who creates the whole universe in seven days.  And god don't love us too.  If he has the powers of a clairvoyant and loves us, if he saw the future of man he would'nt have created us in the first place. He would'nt have created Adam and Eve in the first place.  And if he truly is an absolute god he would'nt have creatd lucifer whom he knew that one day lucifier is going to turn bad and become satan.  Christianity is bulljunk and i totally hate it.  Although i hate christianity i don't really hate christians.  I only dislike those who is obessed with it.

"""Homosexuality is not natural""  This is the most preposterous item I've heard in years. Are you ignorant to what is natural and not?!  Acceptance vs taboo   If you know anything about animal and human sexuality you would properly acknowledge that homosexuality has been around since the existence of sexuality. Animals display it on a daily routine. Alexander the Great, one of the most powerful men in ancient history, had many homosexual tendencies. (even on a more intense level of pedophilia)   As an evolving society, homosexuality was bound to get to the point it has today. Let me also add that if you knew anything about the adoption procedure and the psychological harm that those who go through adoption have to deal with, it would pale to comparison to the teasing they would go through in their schooling.  My point is that on items of sexuality it is not all monkey see monkey do.   I have so many points and so little time. I'm very happy to see the down votes. (means I'm getting to you people!)   As for your opinion, I'm not here to change it. I'm just here to point out all the fallacies in your argument.

So how bout you through that argument in a single parents face and see if you still have a face when they're done with you.

"Gay couples are just like straight couples. You tend to fully judge, what you don't fully understand.  Gay parents get things done. Just like a modern straight couple might have a ""Mr. Mom"" who stays home, while the wife goes to work, doesn't mean that that couple wont be good parents.  There are many untraditional families who make it work. Just because they don't have to body parts you find fit, doesn't mean they can't raise children.  One father can take on the role of the mother. He can be feminine and caring, loving et cetera. These ""roles"" you place on parents are just an illusion.

A boy cannot learn from a woman what it means to truly be a man just as two men cant teach a young woman what it means to become a real woman.     Two women cant do any better raising a boy to be a man than a single mother can, and we all know what that has done to entire generations of young men.   The damaging effects on children from the absence of a father in a family is well documented.   When it comes to the matter of masculinity its just not possible.

"I think that everyone should be given the chance to care for a child. And it all depends how you best give the proper guidance and love for your children. But I am not still favor of gays adopting a child. Child should be well-guided and be nurture and I believe that only a legitimate couple complete with a mom and dad could only provide this. There are studies that children with no father image at home tend to engage more into drugs and other things. This is also the same case if mom is not around. I believe this could be worsen if you are reared by parents who has the same gender.

"This is an interesting topic because most people argue based on their emotions rather than rational thought. Before individuals start accusing me of being homophobic, homosexuality should be accepted as part of life however the raising of children in a same sex household has many questions unanswered.  Dr Albert Dean Byrd a well educated child and family pyschologist has researched this topic for sometime and he found that children throughout their developmental stages need a MOTHER and a FATHER.   He states  ""Children raised in homes with both mothers and fathers navigate the  developmental stages more easily, are more solid and secure in their sense of  self and in their sense of gender identity, perform better in the school system,  have fewer social and emotional problems and become better functioning  adults.""  He further points out the roles the Mother and Father play in the up bringing of a child.   ""Mothers use touch to calm, soothe and to bring comfort to children. When mothers  reach for children, they frequently bring them to their breasts to provide safety,  warmth and security. Father’s touch is most often described as playful and  stimulating, bringing with it a sense of excitement to the child.""  The combination of these roles within a dual gender household clearly shapes the upbringing of a child. The selfish notion of same sex couples wanting to adopt a child or have a child through IVF, or a carrier should be treated with caution.

"Exactly! I am not really against gay marriage or gay rights. However, I am glad I finally found a post that I totally agree with. Some kids are born gay, but most are born straight.

With that said, I didn't grow up in an orphanage, so it is tough to be entirely sure on a position without some doubt...

"Man, when will people just understand that we are  humans first . Sexual orientation doesn't matter. It... It really doesn't.  Instead of asking yourself ""Should gay couples adopt?""

"All homosexuals, male or female, who would adopt a child, are acting in a manner that is contrary to the nature and consequences of homosexuality. For by reason of their supposed natural, sexual orientation, as they call it, their actions negate the possibility of becoming progenitors as a consequence. Moreover, the homosexual nature also axiomatically negates the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors as parents as well as negating the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors to place their well-being as secondary and a child’s primary. However, before they have attempted to adopt a child, all homosexuals have already, in life, demonstrated the predispositional consequences of their sexual orientation which evidence the fact that they cannot put the well-being of anyone before their own subjective well-being. For don’t all homosexuals act contrary to the heterosexuality of their parents from which, as a consequence, they were born into this world? Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? So it should be understood that any homosexual male or female who wants to adopt a child is both, acting contrary to his/her sexuality, and is attempting to make the well-being of a child secondary; for homosexuals who want to adopt a child are choosing to do so for themselves and never because a child wants to be raised by homosexual males or females.   In conclusion: if adoption is acceptable in a society, the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives and never the public or an institution. For neither the public nor any institution can be held accountable for sorry decisions that ill-affect a child; whereas a parent who gives up its’ child for adoption must live with the consequences of that decision and will therefore choose as wisely as is possible in a manner that agrees with the nature of the parent.  Homosexual males and females refuse to be parents. And therefore no rational person ought to give their child to a person who is incapable of acting against his or own nature.
",0
"The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard.  If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child.   Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"".   You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.  I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.

"Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.
",0
"If I understand your logic correctly, your argument is that since homosexual's cannot naturally produce a child, they have no right to become parents. Am I hearing this correctly?
",1
"No statement contained within any of my arguments asserts that homosexuals are biologically incapable of sexual reproduction; the terms of my arguments were carefully chosen so as to not exclude the ability of homosexuals to sexually reproduce. Yet, in order for them to sexually reproduce and propagate their genetics through a progeny they must act contrary to their nature and have unprotected sex with the opposite gender, and probably more than once.    Now, since they actually are biologically capable of becoming progenitors we must therefore conclude they are not willing to do what is necessary to become parents. They choose to do that which will never produce offspring and are suffering the consequences of their choices; moreover, if they don’t like the consequences of their choices they ought to change their minds.   Conclusion: Individuals of the homosexual orientation can become progenitors. Yet, they choose to not do what must be done in order to become progenitors.    And finally, no man or woman has the right to become a parent. Parenthood is not a right; parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction. And no man or woman can justly claim authority over the progeny of another progenitor without the progenitor’s conference of authority over its progeny.
",0
"Well spoken, yet I cannot agree with you. In your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice. There are a few ways I can interpret your second sentence. (in the conclusion) Here is mine, individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice, but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation. Thus, their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction, parenthood is formed.   Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in. Yes, parenthood is, in part, the result of progenitors, but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well. When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood.   You state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction, which I do not disagree, but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing.   Having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation.   Since this is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. Perhaps they aren't the progenitors, but are fully capable of parenting. Thus, any human can posses the abilities to parent. Because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption.
",1
"Yes, you have rightly understood the conclusion of my recent argument with which you do not agree.   Next, you stated in the second paragraph,” Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in.”  My response:  The premise posits that the term parenthood has, ’many definitions’. It also, propositionally, establishes that the argument is based upon multiple definitions of the same term. (This is a non- discreet way of using the fallacy of ambiguity to argue through to an ambiguous conclusion.) The introduction of ambiguity into a debate is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the key term/s of the debate to prove a predetermined a conclusion. And moreover, the explicit claim that more than one definition will be used for the same term invalidates the entirety of the argument. However, disregarding what your intent may or may not be, I will continue with my rebuttal of the remainder of your argument wherein we disagree.  You stated:  When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood.   My response:  If what you claim is true then let’s test the principle of that proposition by application of the principle. The principle: When a man or woman no longer wants to be responsible for that which is theirs, they no longer have rights to that which is theirs. (Lucidly stated for the debate)  A. A husband and wife decide they want to get rid of their house; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the house.  B. A husband and wife decide to offer up their car for free; they no longer have a right to choose whom takes the car.  C. A husband and wife decide to give up their animal pets; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the pets.  All three examples contradict the reality of the transfer of ownership. Albeit, a thief is more likely to agree with the examples than the common person. For the thief presumes it is now his/her property for the taking.  All parents have the natural law of authority of ownership and must first transfer that authority unto another party before another party can rightfully claim the same authority over the respective property whether it is of children, vehicles, houses, or pets. Let’s move on to the next statement.   You claimed:   Since this, (to raise or nurture), is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent.   My response:  Children of the age 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, demonstrate that it is possible for them to possess a nurturing or raising nature; therefore they are possible targets to be parents. Individuals who suffer from diseases of the mind also meet the same criteria. Should they too be allowed to adopt? Pedophiles exactly meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt? The most hardened criminals meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt?  The ultimate conclusion, logically deduced from my arguments, is that no man, woman, or institution has authority to determine the recipient of the transfer of authority of that which is not theirs to begin with, including myself. No one in the world has a right to adopt. No institution in the world has a right to adopt. For if we argue that some have a right to adopt then we must reason that they have authority to steal that which belongs to another person.  A homosexual has no right to adopt. However, the sister of a homosexual has the authority to transfer authority of her child to her homosexual sibling. No right is necessary. And the friend of the sister has no right to determine the recipient of the authority.  Therefore, no gay has a right to adopt. Which is the actual question of the debate.

"From my understanding, the Topic is Gay adoption and should the opportunity of adoption be extended to those in a homosexual relationship. Whether if be a man and a man or a women and a women as a couple having the opportunity to raise a child. Also, the topic makes mention of human interaction with the child, during the raising and nurturing, from a male and a female. Can the same be done with two of the same sex? I would argue that you cannot compare apples to oranges. That is why I was interested in the specific points of nurture and the ability to raise. Which you so eloquently wrote out and felt the need to go into an extreme situation. While I do understand what you are stating, that is why we have a legal system in place. This is to prevent what US society would not consider a suitable parent. What you fail to address is how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.

"In the beginning of my argument I explained why I would not choose to allow a homosexual to adopt. Primarily, the homosexual is inescapably self-centered. The conclusion is to be understood as a universal statement of all homosexuals, not particular. And hence, no explanation is required when it’s two homosexuals seeking to adopt. However, I will now take the time to compound my argument with additional facts after already having logically established my position.    You claim that my argument, ‘fail(s) to address (is) how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.   My reply is yes, I did not address that question, now consider my explanation.   You are requesting that I prove a negative conclusion, i.e. how a gay couple would NOT make a suitable parental unit. It is logically impossible to prove a negative conclusion. I cannot syllogistically arrive at a negative conclusion from negative propositions. The burden of proof belongs to those who claim that homosexuals are suitable parents. Consider the example of what you have accused my argument of lacking.  Gays are bad, the bad should not adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is valid, but it is petition principii, begging the question.   Gays are not good, only the good should adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is invalid and fallacious.  Gays are perverts, perverts are evil; therefore, gays should not adopt.   Argument is both invalid and fallacious.  Gays are not evil, evil is not good; therefore, gays are not good. (Again invalid and fallacious)   Or you could say: 1 is not 2, 2 is not 3; therefore 1 is not 3. . (Again invalid and fallacious)  There are an unlimited number of examples that I could use to demonstrate the impossibility of syllogistically proving a negative conclusion. I suppose the examples I’ve provided shall suffice for the subject at hand.  They who would argue that homosexuals are suitable parents must be burdened by the burden of proof to logically prove their point.    I truly did go to an extreme conclusion in my last argument, as you have stated. Yet, only for the purpose of reductio ad absurdum, reducing the proposition until it is obviously false. And lastly, your reference to the legal system is an appeal to authority, Argumentum Ad Verecundium. (the truth, falsity, or validity of an argument is not subject to a legal system)  Bare in mind that my arguments are for the sake of knowledge and not the sake of attacking or debating; so take no offence for none is intended.

"Hello,  Pardon the delay.  Is sex a crime? No, sex is not a crime. Can a crime be committed by sex? Yes, rape is a crime against another person, which generally implies forced sex. Is the desire for sex a crime? (No) Can a crime be committed as a consequence of a desire for sex? Yes, for a rapist desires to have forced sex with another person. In these examples it can be seen that neither sex nor the desire for sex are crimes and that some crimes are sexual.   All physically, healthy men and women are fully capable of committing sexual crimes. However, and thankfully, most do not commit sexual crimes. Most men and women choose to not force themselves sexually unto another person. They are therefore making a conscious decision. Furthermore, all decisions about with whom they will have sex with are choices evidencing their desire.   The desires of all men and women are consequences, not causes. Then what is the cause of desire? Is it internal or external? Is it genetic? In order to answer these questions I must begin with some fundamentals of the lives of all men and women.  All men and women are responsible for the choices they make; they both suffer or benefit from the consequences of their choices; they also cannot rightfully be held accountable for the choices that others have made. For example, Person (A) cannot be justly imprisoned because of the crimes of person (B). Also, if person (A) is coerced by person (B) to perform a certain act or speak a certain word, person (A) has chosen to comply and is therefore responsible. Person (A) suffers the consequences of compliance or resistance; in either situation, person (A) remains responsible for his/her choices. Regardless of the specific choices that men and women make, all choices are consequences of their desires. Ultimately, we can conclude that all men and women will choose according to their desire and must accept the consequences whether they are joyful or sorrowful.   The desire of man is predicated upon at least one value system. And from that value system are all desires identifiable. Simply stated, the value systems are as follows:  1) My needs are more important than the needs of another person. (Identity=selfish,unjust)  2) My needs are equally as important as the needs of another person. (Identity=just,honest)  3) My needs are less important than the needs of another person. (Identity=affectionate)  I have completed my response. But I have only posted part no.1. We can debate this part before we move on to part 2. I have yet to logically tie the pieces together.

"I am very surprised that you would opt to oppose an argument of mine so soon after our last debate. Perhaps you enjoyed the debate? Let’s see where round number two shall lead the discourse.   You asserted: The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective.

Both propositions are simply irrational.  Moreover, instead of identifying the problem of my argument, your argument proceeds to make claims that have not been syllogistically demonstrated.

"But you are operating under a simplistic view of evolution for your argument. You even seemed to show your ignorance of the difference between a mechanism for evolution(natural selection) and the theory of evolution itself. We're not entirely certain if or how natural selection works on humans. Being sentient beings seems to mess with the dynamic a bit.
",1
"Before I begin, the following reminder is in order :  In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and natural selection.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution   I suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions: ""Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.""; And that your reply is in favor of: ""Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.  The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.  My response:  Consider the consequences of supporting the opposition’s argument.  If homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species; how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species? We can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species. And thus, the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species, but are destructive of the survival of the species. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species. Furthermore, evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species.  We can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group. Is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively, certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual?   The author invalidly reasons: “In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the (human) population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  Either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable. (I don’t think the author intentionally does either one, but unintentionally accomplishes both.) If we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions. For example:  The prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.  The prevalence of butt-licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt-licking among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.   Just because certain things are true of many other species doesn’t allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species. This is called in layman terms: jumping to conclusions.    If you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re-posted above, you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution. The propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports. I did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of life’s continuity. Nor did I suggest one should embrace the theory.    I have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution. And by doing such, I have demonstrated that wherein I reference evolution, I can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions. And for this reason I am not troubled by an accusation that I view evolution simplistically. (Albeit, my argument is particular, yet I was accused of an universal argument.)   Another issue that I must address, before I am accused of neglecting it, is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals, both tangible and intellectual. Whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled/s the survival of a species is purely fallacious. Speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy, argumentum ad speculum. We can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been. Yet, until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member, or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of/for the survival or death of a species, we should not speculate that it is obvious. Can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if Kepler and Newton were never born? Can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge? Yes, we can speculate about anything, but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful.  One last thing before I end this rebuttal; my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions. Your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument. Your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw-man, ad hominem, or red-herring fallacy. In fact, there is no argument in your rebuttals. You simply assert whatever you think is ad populum. A little advice: if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case, I suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time. However, I welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments.

"You sated:  ""The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard.   If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child.   Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"".   You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.""  My response:  Your argument is an excellent example of the fallacy, self-refutation. The argument affirms in one statement that which it denies in another.   You argument asserts that a progenitor gives up its authority to the child when the progenitor gives up the child for adoption. It therefore must be also true when state agencies give up children for adoption they too have no authority. Explain why the argument expresses the denial of authority for the progenitor in the case of adoption while consequently implying the affirmation of authority of state agencies that too seek adoption for a child. Whether your argument is willful deception or a logical error remains for you to decide.  Next, reread the conclusion and you will find: ’ …..the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives’…... The child remains under the authority of the parent until the child is adopted. You attempted to redefine that which was previously defined in the argument, and your argument is attempting to establish the straw-man fallacy.  Again, you stated:   'You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.'  Therefore in accord with that proposition the following is valid:  Society accepts homosexuality. Therefore, homosexuality is an institution.  Society accepts masturbation. Therefore, masturbation is an institution.  Society accepts stupidity. Therefore, stupidity is an institution.  Society accepts whatever. Therefore, whatever is an institution.  Reductio ad absurdum!  Again, you stated:  'If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. '  What do you mean by maintaining a child? Your arguments are validating my arguments.  Parents maintain their cars, houses, lawns, toilets, tubs, sex toys, etc., but never can it be said that they maintain their children, unless of course they are alike janitors and maintenance personnel. Parents, through out the life of either themselves or their children, always strive to care for their progeny in whatever capacity is required at any given time and provide both tangible and abstract necessities.   You assert: “I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.”  Your final statement doesn’t challenge any assertion in paragraph one. Moreover, paragraph one of the argument is not a psychological description of any subject and hence cannot be psychologically valid or invalid. It is however an argument that is demonstratively evidenced by the deeds of homosexuals. No attempt was made in my argument to suggest a description of the mind or the thought processes of male or female homosexuals.  And lastly, if homosexuals are that caring why would they adopt a baby that they cannot breast feed? For breastmilk is the best milk for infants. All companies that produce baby formula admit that their products are second best.   The natural order of life among animals is predicated upon the breast milk of the mother. And just because female homosexuals can be made pregnant by methods contrary to nature doesn’t mean they should be a mother; for by reason of their nature they will not naturally become mothers.

"It's not in our nature to fly but we build airplanes. The inability to CONCEIVE children is a consequence of homosexuality, but in no way reflects on ones ability to raise and love a child.   Does not.  ""Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? ""  uh... NO.  So Gay people being themselves are pleasing themselves by making their parent sad when they come out? What? There are more assumptions in this statement than I care to address.   Not all gay people are pleased with being gay due to the society we are in, and to assume all parents hate to hear their kid is gay just completely shows us how twisted your logic is.

"Your first argument compares two things that are not related; this is a fallacy of faulty analogy. The ability to fabricate an aircraft does not evidence an ability to raise and love a child. The argument does not deductively evidence why any person, gay or not gay, can raise and love a child. Moreover, you have asserted that homosexuals are not able to conceive children. Therefore, we can deduce from your claim that homosexuals are biologically deprived of the necessary organs for the conception of a child. Lastly, the argument is ineffective in proving any thing syllogistically. And as for the remainder of your claims and rhetorical questions they don’t deserve refutation. The entirety of the argument fails to prove one thing that has been validly deduced by the author.    Your final statement,” The assumption that there is something existentially negative about being gay.”   A. It is a sentence fragment. The subject is identified but there is no predicate.   B. You affirmed there is something that is existentially negative about being gay; they cannot conceive children.   Your whole of your argument begins with irrationality and ends with irrationality.  I expect that your future reply will also be equally irrational.

For the record: I despise the state institution of adoption. Thou shalt not covet…  No man or woman can provide a reasonable justification for transgressing that commandment. The fact that there exists a supposed argument that would justify the act of coveting the sons and daughters of other humans is evidence to me of a people who are dead to the words of the commandments.

"Well, first of all, preventing gays from adopting because of a religious law would be a violation of the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution.  Secondly, we are not talking about 'coveting' the sons and daughters of other people, because we are talking about orphans who don't have parents. Even if we weren't talking about orphans, this makes the assumption that children are the literal property of their parents.

"Heres where you screwed yourself... well first off, in your mother's basement, where you obviously reside.  Secondly, when you said, ""Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families?""  I believe that you're implying that all families are sad and distraught over their child's homosexuality? This is not the case.  Homosexuality can be accepted, tolerated, and celebrated. Just because you are a homosexual doesn't mean that you are in defiance of anything.  You are embracing your own feelings. You are being true to yourself. I would argue that someone who does not love themselves, should not attempt to love anyone else. You have to love yourself, and you have to have a genuine love for someone else in order to successfully raise a child. The child understand that love. He or she can learn that there are many types of love, and that it can be expressed in whatever way, with whomever he or she finds suitable for them. But that child needs just an example of love.  Shut up and listen, for once.  Love is all you need.

I am not against gays, but I do believe that adoption is a whole new level.

I'm not saying this will never happen, I'm just stating that gay couples adopting is not something society can deal with right now, we must be logical when it comes to promoting such laws, a step like this one is too much too soon.

",1
"This is a touchy subject. However, I believe that it's important for a child to have been raised by a  mother  and a  father . Each parent gives his or her child different life lessons and raises a child differently. Sure, one man could act as the father and the other as the "" mother "", but I think gender is a factor in how you raise your child, no matter sexual orientation. And then there's single parents. The difference there is that they are open to dating other people, so the boyfriends or girlfriends can come into the home and help the single parent in raising his or her child.
",0
"But then what happens if there is a family with a  mother  and a  father , but, say, they get divorced, or a parent dies, or something, and then there is only one parent? Is the child going to come out of childhood 'messed up,' or different, like you say would happen? There are plenty of examples of successful, well-rounded adults coming out of homes of all types, ones with only a father, many with only a mother, so I don't see the difference, in your example, if there is a single parent or two parents of the same gender.
",1
"Hey, guess who in a child's life is most likely to abuse him or her?  Yep, the boyfriends and girlfriends of that single parent. Good job, you just hypothetically got your hypothetical kid hypothetically raped.  Give an example of what ONLY a female or ONLY a male can teach a child. Not something that could easily be researched.
",1
"I agree with HGrey's point here about the subjectivity of gender. I do not think there are specific things that can be ""taught"" through ONLY one gender. However, I do think having a parent of that gender helps; a daughter would want to talk to her mother about her period, if given the choice. But fathers can definitely talk about it as well (even though it might be a bit uncomfortable).  To quickly state my piece:  Yes, I believe gay parents should be able to adopt. I do not think a child  needs  a mother and father to get a healthy perspective on things. I found an old article about this issue a while ago:    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/ 26florida.html    It was about the Florida ban on gay adoption that was ruled unconstitutional (but you can see that from the title).  I even found an older article about a ""new take"" on the American family:  http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/25/ gay.adoption/index.html    By doing a quick google search, you can see that it is not on the forefront of the political crossfire as gay marriage is, but it is a important issue. I think one of the main reasons it makes people so uncomfortable is that everyone feels like they know how to rear children the best, whether it is with homosexual parents, hetoersexual parents, single parents, or whatever. It is a touchy issue for most people, since everyone has to listen to their mother-in-laws bicker once and a while.  I'm interested to hear more from the anti-gay adoption side. This debate is open to all.
",1
"I disagree. And I'm actually picking your argument to comment on because it made more sense than most of the others on here. Although you are right in saying each parent gives certain lessons to a child and it's important that that child has different influences, these lessons do not have to come from people of the same gender. Different parents are going to be different no matter their gender. Nurturing doesn't necessarily come from the mother and discipline from the father. Also, say the parents are both men, the children aren't going to be secluded from women in their life. They will have aunts, grandmothers, teachers, family friends, etc that can serve as role models and examples. Also, regardless of whether your arguments make sense or not, it simply isn't shown in any studies done on children raised by gay parents

"For what reason? From what I understand, 'marriage' is a social construct. 'Marriage' has not held the same definition since its creation, and it is also different across cultures.

And look at this country: until only just recently (the past 50 years or so), it was completely acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. It was a ""personal"" issue, not domestic violence.   I suggest reading this article on how traditional marriage has changed over time:   http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/ 260456_marriage.html    What I'm trying to get at is: of course homosexual marriages are unnatural. ALL marriages are unnatural. They are constructs of society. And if the society sees it fit, it can change the rules.

I did not follow any religious traditions as a child and I don't believe I even was told of my parents political affiliations until I had formulated my own opinions. Additionally I am more liberal than both of my parents, and I have changed their minds on many issues, while they have never changed my positions that I can recall.   ""I guess then, that I am being oppressed by you two double teaming me on every freaking debate.""   Quit belly-aching. I personally relish debating when outnumbered, but it should not make it any more difficult. If your arguments are valid, they will stand against an infinite number of people. There are other conservatives on this website and it is not our fault if they are too afraid to come to your aid.

"""Saying that this country allows oppression is a false accusation? You need to read over American history again. The slaughter of Native Americans, slavery, segregation, Japanese internment camps are all particularly relevant.""   Thats  exactly  why I said  ""going on right now"" . Do you remember that? Or do you have selective reading?   As for the video, I see where you are coming from with the 'fear mongering'. But the thing is, everything in that video is true. If I don't want my kids being taught that homosexuality is normal or okay why should I have to worry about it?   I believe that it is wrong. In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country. Instead of fear mongering and saying that religion is bad because it will oppress you.

"You said she should not accuse the country of oppression and I was pointing out that our country has a history of it. And as I said even though past oppression may have been worse, it does not take away from the oppression now. But you failed to respond to that point, typically.  No everything in that video is not true. Proposition 8 had nothing to do with schools or children. As I said in another recent post, under California law parents can remove their children from any health or family lesson. Proposition 8 did not even mention kids or adoption or education.   ""In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country.""   Once again you demonstrate your complete lack of understanding of the Constitution. If you had a true or false question, ""Is America based on majority rules?"", the answer would be false. The system is set up with majority rules and minority rights with the latter not being an afterthought. The founders specifically set it up that way to avoid the kind of oppression that they experienced in Great Britain. The majority does not have the legal right to oppress the minority. Morally I strongly disagree with you that the oppressed minority should just ""get over it or move to another country."" Should the slaves have just gotten over it? But of course morals are opinions so neither of us is right. Legally, however, you couldn't be more incorrect.

Here were some of the lies spread by the Proponents of Prop 8:   Prop 8 doesn't discriminate against homosexuals.  Prop 8 took away a right that gays already had. They were able to get married, and the passage of prop 8 took away that right. Regardless of whether not you agree with prop 8, it took away a right they already had and therefore is discrimination.   Children will be taught that same-sex marriage is ok  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you do not live in California. I cannot tell you how many ads I saw talking about how children would learn that homosexuality is alright. Regardless of how intolerant that is, it is a lie.

They have jobs, they pay taxes, they participate in committed loving relationships, they love and respect their parents.

It's a matter of perception. And I have to tell you that other than biblical references, there is no excuse for thinking being gay is wrong. Or for thinking that gay people can't raise children.

"Wow, you are a chore.  I am calling you closed minded. You have to be willing to attempt to see the issue from the other person's point of view. I have tried to see this issue from your point of view, that of someone who believes that homosexuality is wrong because the bible says it to be so. But even if I accepted that, I would still have to forfeit that I can't find anything else wrong with it. So that one little fact, that the bible says it's wrong, isn't enough for me. But at least I have opened my mind and tried to understand it.  My mind is always open, at least when I'm talking to logical people (ie. not belligerent or insane).  I'm bisexual, remember? I was attracted to girls before I had even seen a television. So no, I'm not brainwashed. I'm fighting for what I know, and understand. I know I'm not an immoral person. I don't ""sin."" I'm a really good person, in fact. So to me, it feels like people want LGBT people to be all sinning and rebels and haters. No. We're just fun, sweet, people who are constantly attacked by a single idea that's seeded it's silly little butt into a whole mess of people's heads. The sinners are those hot Catholic school girls who take their shirts off for girls gone wild the second they get out of the house. In fact, that is what's wrong with the white picket fence scenario. It's too straight edge. The people who grow up in those houses don't, in my experience, even know what the real world is.  By opening your mind, I want you to try and think of homosexuality as ""not a sin"" for maybe just a minute. And I know your faith tells you not to do that, but that is a method of self preservation of the Church. You don't have to change you entire ideals forever. I just want you to imagine, and think. Then once you're done, you can go back and apply those thoughts. It's not a bad thing to do. It's like looking in a mirror... just get a little outside prospective.  You can vote however you like. It's your right. But, what I can do about it is try and help you understand that you are blindly hurting people and families by voting this way. You hurt people who just want to love and raise a family. And you are hurting families who are already established by invalidating their love for each other, and telling them it's blasphemy. If someone said that about your family or a member of your family, wouldn't it hurt you?  I forgot you're a Mormon, and not just a Christian. A family, to me, is a unit of people who love each other. With or without children, with or without a traditional marriage, with or without money, a house or even a marriage license. A family is who you can always count on.  That being said, I have a father and a mother. I also have a step mother, a step father, I have a sister, I have a brother, I have my niece, I have my niece's father, my nieces father's family, my cousins in Japan, my cousins in Poland, my cousins in Colorado, my aunts and uncles, and my grandma. All family.  But do you know who my  family  is? My mother. That's it. My father is an abuser and a recovering alcoholic, my brother and sister are both schizophrenic and gone. So why is my mother my family? Because she taught me right from wrong, she never turned her back on me, and she will always love me. And yes, I'm young. But I've been through a lot of shit, and had a lot of life experience. And at the end of the day all I need is that love from my mother. If she were gay I wouldn't care, if she were autistic I wouldn't care, if she weren't even my real mother I wouldn't give a damn. because she loves me. So I know, that all it takes to raise a good kid is love and dedication. Screw the Church, screw the State.

But I think that there could be consequences and pluses.   But I think that letting them adopt children would be leading those children into an extremely awkward upbringing. That would make them outcasts. Kids are extremely brutal just read A Child's Machiavelli, everything rings true. Picture your average bully not only picking on a kid because of his looks but now he has a weapon that would make that kid a total outsider to all other kids. Kids find it odd when a kid has no father or mother, or when he/she lives with his/her grandparents or are adopted to a hetero family a kid with 2 fathers or mothers doesn't fit into the mix for a proper upbringing in a peers perspective at a young age. It would all lead down a messed up life for the kid down the road he would be confused with his sexual orientation and countless other issues.  But then ,maybe all the toughness would make that kid an even better person than all the other kids that made fun of him or didn't step forward to defend him.

"You bring up a very interesting point DaWolfman. Would gay adoption be unfair for the child? From my point-of-view, I would say no. If the parents were loving and caring, and the child was raised in a good household, then I would imagine it would be more of a benefit than a hindrance. As for the bullies on the playground picking on the kid, it is unfair but it happens. Children are picked on for a plethora of reasons: for their intelligence, hair, freckles, deformities, you name it. But I don't think that means they should compromise to fit the social norm (especially the social norm of a playground bully, whatever age that may be).   But I do think you raised an interesting point. It would be intriguing to hear from a child who is raised by gay parents, or from an adult who was raised by gay parents.

Give me AN EXAMPLE of how two male parents would be worse than a man and a woman.  2. And no, it won't make the kid gay; There is no evidence to support that. There's also no evidence linking homosexuality with pederasty. There is no evidence to link gay households with problem children. Sorry, you're full of shit.  3.

"The most important thing for a child to have in his or her life is a stable home, especially one where they can see a loving relationship. Yes, they need role models from both men and women. They need role models from as many types of people they can. I am a lesbian and I plan on having children eventually but I'm not going to seclude them from men. I have my father, my cousins, friends, and uncles all of whom I consider decent people and I'll make sure they can see all the types of lives in the spectrum. No study has shown that children raised by gay parents have more problems with gender roles or sexuality than those raised by straight couples. The only negative impact I can see is a child getting picked on for it but a) that is not the parents' fault but the society's and b) kids will always find something to make fun of because they are kids. It's what happens and, to an extent, it builds strength when paired with love from others.

First I read about how the motives of the gay person are selfish   My response: WHO CARES? I see an old lady crossing the street. I help her cross over. Did I do it because I truly cared for her or did I do cause I wanted to feel good about myself? Does it matter? As long as I didn't help her because I wanted to steal her purse in the process then where is the harm???? So what if gays want to satisfy their parental instincts by caring for a child? How does that undermine the care and the love? Don't straight couples do the same? How many times have I heard straight couples saying that they will have children because that ""completes the family"", that they can't wait to be great mums or great dads. That's selfish too isn't it? But is it wrong? Hell no! I would be worried of someone didn't have that streak of selfishness in them. In my opinion, the people that make the best parents are the ones that wanted to be parents in the first place. Not just procreate, but BE PARENTS afterward. Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we're telling them ""you can't! we'd rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!""   Then it's about how it is unnatural for them to become parents because by definition they would be required to do something that is unnatural for them    Right, so, should we exclude all infertile individuals from the right to adopt?  Because the above argument basically implies that inability to conceive/procreate equals inability to perform as a parent, because nature didn't want you to become one in the first place. Isn't that ridiculous? The fact that we have children in foster care proves that the ability to conceive/procreate does not equal the ability to become a parent. So the two are clearly not cross linked.   Then it's about how it is no one's right to adopt because the only person that has authority over a child is the biological parent - only they can ""appoint"" someone to look after their child   Someone actually used the word ""property"", the child is the property of the biological parents and no institution should ever have the right bypass them and give the child to someone else.   Since when are human beings ""property""?  As a parent, all you have, is the responsibility to raise the child and provide for it. That's all you have. You don't posses a child. No one has possession of another human being, however young.   Now, I know for a fact that adoption agencies always look for people in the immediate or larger family that would foster the child. It's only when they have exhausted all those possibilities that the child is put up for adoption. In other words, no one in the family has offered to take over the responsibility! So it is then in the hands of the agency to find suitable parents from the general public. Let's be realistic, the family has absolved itself, or is not existent, or is mentally incapable. Now, I'm not saying everybody else then has the right to be their parent. But I think they do have the right to at least apply for the role, whether gay or straight.    But the child is going to be bullied!   Well, is that really an argument? If the kid is going to be bullied that's because the parents of the other children are bigoted and they have instilled that bigotry on their bully-kid. Kids are bullied everyday for being black, Muslim, Asian, tall, short, ginger etc etc. Does that mean we should take them away from their black, Muslim or ginger parents?   The reality is, these kids are spending their life in an orphanage. I find it funny how people who are otherwise unwilling to adopt them, think that they have the right to obstruct others who do. And they justify it with an array of bigoted crap. And all this time, those kids remain in the orphanage, when they could be in the hands of very loving, very caring, very responsible people who could give them a much better life, a much better education and much more to experience.

"To say that two men or two women necessarily can't raise a child as well as a one-man-one-woman couple is sexist and inaccurate. We all know there are some heterosexual couples who are clearly unqualified to raise children. Restrictions on adoption should depend on the individual circumstances of the adopting family, not on generalised statements about the differing parenting styles of men and women.

"I don't think that having two mothers or two fathers can screw a child up. By this, I mean that I don't think he will become a serial killer or schizophrenic or anything based solely on the fact that his parents are of the same sex. I have heard that there have been tests on this sort of thing, and gay couples children have turned out to be just about 'normal.' Perhaps, if the child is female, and her parents are both male, she will turn out to be more masculine than the average girl, but what is wrong with that? I also believe that if her two parents are both very feminine, she will turn out to be 'normal.' So, it is not so much the gender of the parents, but their personalities that mold the child. In this country, many hetero parents with children get divorces, or one of the parents dies, and it is then legal for only the mother/father to raise the child on their own. So, if having either no mother/father figure screws up a child, shouldn't raising a child on your own be illegal for as long as gay adoption is?  Also, don't most, or at least some, adopted babies come from third world countries where they will end up living their lives in poverty, violence, and probably no parents if they are not adopted? I don't understand why anyone would want to see a child raised this way instead of with two men who will love and care for them. It makes me sick.

"Really, why should it matter? Is being the child of a gay couple really worse than having no parents at all?

",1
"Yes. Their sexual proclivities do not say much about their parenting skills. Indeed, there are plenty of cases where the gay or lesbian couples are better suited and prepared to raise the children than those who gave them up in the first place.

I've seen them build both strength and character through their upbringing.  I tell you what I've experienced personally and do not resort to the ""fact"" sheets.

Just because you have judged that a person is not gay today doesn't rule out the possibility that the judgment may change in the future.

"Jake said:   It hurts families, the more gay marriage the less families there will be, children need a mother and a father to look up to.   Good job voting that idiotic statement down everyone. I don't think the source of that idea has been explored enough though. And personally, I believe in humilating idiotic statements as a form of social punishment, so here goes. Hopefully you read this Jake.  gay marriage = less families only if you believe that people would  choose  to be gay instead of heterosexual.  that is, you jake, think that someone who is otherwise attracted to the opposite sex, would have had kids and raised them, will now move in with someone of the same sex and not have kids.  ignoring for a moment that this isn't all together bad since there are too many people. what kind of person would think that may be the case?  I know for myself, being very comfortable in my heterosexuality, I would not magically  turn  gay because a law was passed.   do you fear, jake, that you may magically  turn  gay if a law were passed?  because that is really the only reason for your statement. if you actually think about what your wrote, I mean, that's the only possible end conclusion.  and if you do stand behind that statement jake, I have to ask myself, what kind of person would have such a ridiculous fear.  and I can only think of one kind jake. a closet gay person.  so if you want to come out, which I'm assuming from your statement deep down you do, then this is the place for it. There seems to be a lot of open people here, and at least one very popular openly gay member.  it's okay jake, be brave.  and if you do choose to not come out, that's okay, I understand it's a cold hard world out there for a gay person. but know this at least.   whatever you do, whatever you say, no matter how much you deny it, I at least will always know that, you jake, are gay. and I accept that.

An intelligent straight person would never like it to not allow gays to marry and adopt children.  If gays can marry and adopt that means that baby making isn't a very big deal since the gays are going to raise them. (If you are a religions fundie, that means you can be more logically for pro-life if you are pro-gay-marriage)  Plus, if there are so many women left alone, or rather lonely, than you can have a lot of sex.  Oh, and by the way, straight men like sex with women (right guys? :)), so they couldn't mind.  The only people who could POSSIBLY mind gays are gay people who don't want to be gay(...and raise kids and miss all the coitus..., but they don't like it anyway) and women who fall in love with gays.

I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with me, but I think there is a baseline group of gay people and then a huge amount of other people who are gay because of peer pressure, insecurity, and/or because it's the popular thing to be right now.

He said he was happy either way, but thinks this is what makes him happiest.  I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't. And after reading more of the responses on here it just gets back to this absurd point that those of us who are ""opposed"", and I use this term loosely because to tell you the truth, until the prop 8 fiasco in which the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from me I honestly didn't give a damn, to gay marriage are hated, disposed, called names, attacked, been told ""no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage"" as is said on this board, while we on the other side are about as polite as can be.

Do you  not  think gay people get made fun of, discriminated against, and avoided all of the time  for  being gay?

"""That guy who was engaged then ""turned gay"" was already gay. Society told him he wasn't gay, that's why it took so long to figure out.""  Lol, see again, I am flabbergasted that it is impossible for you to accept that someone might have an opinion different from yours.  ""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""  One example of society telling someone they're gay? You! You just did! To Joe. If you want another example look at any showing of a gay person on a TV show. If you act like x you are gay.  ""Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay.""  The right to vote is being stolen in CA. Twice the majority of people voted to define marriage clearly and twice the homosexuality community has tried to overturn the will of the people by using judges. The pursuit of happiness is in the declaration of independence and not the Constitution. If this is the justification for the right to marry whomever you want, it also justifies everything else you can think of, so long as it makes the pursuer happy. There is no constitutional right to marry whomever you want. Every citizen is equally protected with the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. If you're gay, you have the right to marry. So again, what right are you being denied? Visitation rights are already granted in the state of CA, as are inheritance and all other rights of married couples, es per Gov. Davis in 2000.  ""Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay?""  African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers? Of course not. The fact that some nut-case has murdered a gay person before does not make everyone who believes homosexuality is wrong into a murderer. Are you in fear for your life often? If so I am sad, but I sort of doubt it, that's just not the way the world is anymore (in this country). Are you afraid to express your opinion about this topic? I doubt it. I am. If I tell people what I think, I LOSE MY JOB. That's why I post here anonymously :)  ""The Mormon and catholic churches, but especially the Mormon churches, spent millions trying to deny a group of people a human right""  Marrying members of the same sex is not a human right. Sorry. Until you can show me what human right is being denied, I don't know where else to go with this. As far as the donations go, the Mormon church DID NOT DONATE A DIME. Neither did the Catholic church (I think, I'm not positive about them). MEMBERS of these churches donated to a cause they believed was right. They have the right.  I have no problem with protests. I have a problem with vandalism, violence, riots, assault, disenfranchisement, and attack of religious liberty (suing to remove tax exempt status of people who disagree with them). I was opposed to it when the homosexuality was attacked and mocked and derided; I oppose it now when they do the same thing to their enemies.

"Thanks E223, I'm getting so bored of replying to these. Tallblondguy - whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is  not  a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of  opinion.  It's a fact. People are born gay, straight, or bi. Any change is due to chemical composition of the brain. People take forever coming out of the closet (often) because gays are discriminated against.   The next paragraph where you say my response is an example of how society tells people to be gay... I think you miss read. It was an ironic diatribe of Jake's senseless response to gay marriage. You see, ironic because  he  though not intentional, was giving a bigoted response, so I pointed out how his response made it appear he was one of the people himself that he was being a bigot against... I know confusing. What's even more confusing is that infact the response  would not have even worked  had it been, as you said, me  encouraging  him to be gay... I don't, from your arguements, expect you to understand that.  Okay, your entire right to vote arguement boggles the mind. According to your own arguement, (this is called a parody, it helps people like you who can't understand stuff, understand stuff. I'm waiting though for your literal response, since I'm sure you won't get the nuance) if 51% of Americans say we should reinstate slavery, then we didn't, then that means some great travesty had taken place, enough said.  Uh... okay, now to where you twisted around my arguement to mean something completely and obviously different than what I said.    you  said that gay people were  not  discriminated against. I gave an example of how they were. Then you went all ""black people this"" and ""fear"" that, and went on a rant about losing your job.  You seem to think I live in some state of fear? You're aware that I'm not gay right? If not, now you are, not that it matters in the least in any of my arguements. So I'm not sure why you think I may be afraid of something, but from my profile you can actually follow a link to my site, which has my name, David Heintzelman, it even has a map of exactly where I live for shits and giggles. Again, where you got the idea I was afraid is beyond me. You though... first you accuse me of being afraid, then you say how you post anonymously because... you're scared. It seems a bit schitzo.  As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...   http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_11102139    http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/ queer-town/queer-town-the-catholic- power/    Last paragraph; you make the point earlier in your arguement (albeit the point was completely out of context of the arguement you were then debating) that just because  ""African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers?""  And so I would say the same of any of the vandalism you're implying is the work of the gay hordes - of which I have heard of none, a link wouldn't hurt your arguement there.  And there's a whole debate already devoted to whether religions should pay taxes, where I posted I think a couple times at least. But for the record, they should. Any group that tries to influence policies of a nation, should than have to participate as a member of that society, hence pay taxes. If religious groups want to maintain their tax exempt status, they should excuse themselves from influencing policy. You can't have your cake and eat it to.

"In today's society people discriminate against homosexuals all the time. In the classroom, at people's offices, in people's own families. Right now, in many places throughout the U.S. being homosexual is something to be ashamed of. When kids think something is lame what do they say? ""That's gay."" I think this fact alone speaks volumes of the homophobia in today's society.  You are looking at the extreme examples at the expense of the whole picture. If someone said you could not marry the person you loved, would you be upset? Would you do whatever you could to fix what you perceived as a grave injustice? I want you to understand that I do not condone violence, but legal action is perfectly within people's rights.   People are upset, and they have just reasons for being upset. If someone tells you that you were to live in a country that promises ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" but later you find out that this is a lie, wouldn't you be upset? Would you be pretty fucking pissed off? Once again, anger to the point of violence is wrong, but fighting for your rights is reasonable....hell, it's American.  As for the vote on prop. 8, the majority should never have the power to take away rights from a minority group. It has happened in our past when other groups were discriminated against based on race. People voted on laws democratically, but eventually courts overturned these laws. Such was the case in California before prop. 8 was passed. The California supreme court deemed that disallowing homosexuals to marry was discriminatory. They came to this conclusion because they  had to base their decision on facts . When the issue was put to a vote, people could base their decision on whatever reasons they wanted: their religious views, their ignorance, their intolerance and bigotry etc... Just because you don't want a certain group of people to not have rights doesn't allow you to take those rights away from them. You have to have a reason. A damn good one.  So now, tallblondebigotedguy,  what are your reasons ? What do you find so wrong with two people who love each other being allowed to enter into legal marriage? I swear that I am listening to your reasons now. Don't hide behind false pretenses of discrimination, or that people don't respect your views, because until you can give me your reasoning, all of that is irrelevant.

(I'll give you a hint, it's a word you just used)  The irony is that I honestly didn't give a damn about gay marriage before activists started to attack everyone who disagreed with them. My little sister was afraid to go to school for 3 weeks during the prop 8 vote. I think the problem is that the gay community thinks that discrimination is having people think they're doing something wrong, and that's simply not discrimination. The entire issue of gay marriage is centered around the idea that you want everyone not just to tolerated you, but to tell you what you're doing is ok, and if this doesn't happen, it's discrimination to you.  Once again that is the decleration of independence by the way. Life liberty and pursuit of happiness. No one can show me in the CONSTITUTION where it guarantees the right to marry, and that include the tyrannical judges who base their decision based on what they think should be instead of what the law is. You know what that's called, when 7-9 judges (or really 4 or 5, since it's never been more than a simple majority) go against the constitutiont to pass a law they think is right? That's called tyranny. Do you support tyranny? What if it wasn't in your favor? What if those judges said gays should be burned? That's why there are checks and balances.   I think the real problem here comes to two points that will always divide this arguement.  1) you believe homosexuality is like race: something someone is born with and has no control over. The opposing side believes it is action realted, because someone is not gay, somone is living a gay lifestyle. The problem is a word symantics one. If you define gay as attracted to members of the same sex, than it's a moot point, because that person is not limited in any way. But if being gay is having a relationship with a member of the same sex, than it has become an action, and thus is not afforded any special protection because it is action-oriented. All of this is moot in my opinion because no matter what you still have all the same rights as straight people, but your arguement rests on it entirely.  2) Marrying whomever you love is a basic right. This just isn't true. If it was, than what about pedophiles. Studies show many of them are born with these feelings. What about serial killers? We know they're born that way. Obviously these are extreme examples and gays and serial killers are in no way alike, but I use them as examples to show that this arguement cannot stand up legally. And besides, it's just not in the constitution.  I am not a bigot. 90% of my friends are gay, and they're my very best friends. If you can pass a law that gives you the right to marry I am all for it. I may even vote for it if people ask me nicely instead of yelling at me. But I have been opposed for over 10 years to people manipulating courts to get their legistlature through.  I know you think it's a right in the constitution, or you think it should be. It's not, so make it one! This vote failed, but not for long. By the time my generation is completely in charge, it will be legal the right way. So hope for that instead of bringing down our country's established system with judicial legislation (as if it could sink any lower).

"Wow, I was so done with your arguements. You completely ignore every point made by anyone. Then twist around words to fit in this weird idea you have that somehow gays are discriminating against  you  by wanting to get married. Then you start making up stories about your sister being ""scared"" of all the gays on her way to school...  At first I thought you were a sane, but misled person. Now I am really beginning to believe you are crazy.  There are no gays rioting the streats. No one's lives or daughters or sisters are in mortal danger.  You don't see how comments like that are even more hateful and destructive than just saying things like ""I hate fags?"" Because they really are.   Then you tried to compare gay people to pediphiles!  You don't see that gay marriage is between two consenting people?  You really need to write an apology for this entire arguement...

"OK, I am in perfect agreement with you that this conversation should probably be over. I'll respond to both posts. First, I don't apologize for my opinions. I have, however, clarified to my earlier post, that when I forgot to specifically mention pedophilia as being unrelated to homosexuality, I assumed the reader would group pedophilia and serial murder. I have clarified this point, and I'll say again, pedophilia and serial killing are in no way similar to homosexuality. I was merely using hyperbole to show that people do not have a right to do everything they are born desiring.  ""whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact.""   http://www.cwfa.org/images/content/ bornorbred.pdf   a scholarly response to the idea that this has been pr oven. I'm sure we can both go on all day posting on this idea, the reality is we just don't know. I personally believe people are born with a predisposition toward homosexuality which can either be cultivated or repressed, but everyone has the ability to make decisions in their life. Besides, no one is arguing gays should stop what they're doing (well, some people probably are).  Again, ad homonyms all over. It seems If anyone says something you disagree with the best thing to do is call them hateful and stupid. Oh and gay, but I guess I'm too dumb to get that.  If 51% of people voted for slavery it wouldn't matter because slavery is made illegal by the constitution and the courts would then have an obligation to point that out. That's what it's for. If anyone can show me where it says you have a right to marry whomever you want in the constitution I will go picket in CA right now.  I guess I should be more clear. Gay people have been persecuted for a long time. It's a shame they feel the need to persecute others now that they are gaining popularity. And you can call me a liar whenever you disagree with me if you like (it's very effective I'm sure), but my sister cried every day during the prop 8 thing because she supported it and she was constantly harassed. I never said she was afraid for her life, but that does make the story more interesting, doesn't it :)  ""You seem to think I live in some state of fear?""  This was also irony. I was suggesting that discrimination against gays has largely disappeared (that doesn't mean everyone agrees with you, it just means their rights are no longer being violated, i.e. they can get work, they don't get killed (hopefully!), etc). I apologize about thinking you were gay (not that its bad), you made a comment on an earlier post that I must have misunderstood.  ""As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...""  I hate to play the ""I'm right"" game, but I am here. Do more research, my father is a leader in the Mormon church. While church members donated and were asked to support the legislature, the church itself did not make any political donations. I'm not as sure about the Catholics, but if they're smart they played it the same way. I agree that some of the churches which are heavily political (i.e. Jeremiah Wright?) should get out of politics or be taxed as political entities. Churches do, however, have a right to encourage voting on moral issues (it's actually in the law, believe it or not), and both of these churches are silent on political issues outside of this.  I won't apologize for my opinion. The real irony is that I'm not even opposed to gay marriage. I'm opposed to people who will do anything to get their way, no matter who it hurts. Anyway, you've heard my point of view. I will change it the minute anyone can shows me that gay marriage is a protected constitutional right, or when a vote is passed. Until then, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, and I even respect your right to hate and mock everyone who disagrees with you (thought I will then ask you to respect my right to call you a hateful shallow bigot. yay free speech). I would honestly be happy for everyone to just say, look, you and I disagree, but we have that right and we can still be friends, because right now that's not happening... Oh, and I still don't like the courts usurping authority not given to then by the constitution :)

"OK, so apparently I need to clarify every single statement and point out that when I said gays are not like serial killers AT ALL, and this was merely hyperbole to show a fallacious argument, I forgot to mention pedophilia. Homosexuality and pedophilia are obviously not related AT ALL. i thought this was pretty obvious from the way I wrote it, but apparently some people need it spelled out.

"When you operate outside social norms you are classified as a Deviant. Your anus or a plastic/steel/wooden rod is not a sexual organ; therefore using them in a sexual act should be considered abnormal, shouldn't it? Having anal sex is like trying to eat food with your eyes (it just was not design for that). The normal curve is used in all fields of studies to classify what is acceptable and what's not. It also determines when mechanical plants are to be changed, unearths systematic errors and blunders. Of special concern are systematic errors, which are frequently caused by miscalibration. This error in a system also produces normal curve, but skewed. Thus, shifting the goal post thereby making previously deviance behaviour acceptable. That’s why you (ChadOnSunday221) can no longer see that gay marriages are immoral and unethical; it was a slide of hands.

"I don't believe gay marriage hurts anyone. The only people truly making it such a mad case is religious people. Sure, marriage is somewhat an act out of religion, but like others said, what is it if someone unreligious gets married? If people are going to make a big deal out of two people of the same sex getting married, then people of different religions, people of no religion, even people guilty of adultery shouldn't be allowed to marry either. Being against gay marriage really comes down to what people that follow the bible say the bible says. Which makes gay marriage against the bible, right? But then again, every single person on this planet is doing lots of stuff against the bible. So, really, what gives these religious people the right to say someone can't do something they disapprove of? Otherwise, I'd like to meet a non-religious person, or even a person acquainted with gay's, who is against gay marriage. (Just because it proves my case otherwise that it's all about religious bitching and it has not one thing to do with them personally). So, really, gay marriage is hurting those that let it hurt them for no rightful reason.

You haven't shown abnormal behavior to be unacceptable, just stated that it is frequently unaccepted - by people like you.  I suppose the once deviant notion that a woman's word was equal to that of a man's, the abnormal view that women should be allowed to vote and own property was just ""a slide of hands"" by the women's rights movement. And, of course, if we apply your logic evenly, this makes them immoral and unethical for perpetrating deviant behavior. Godforbid we see it as social progress, it was something new and different, how could it be?   Your slippery slope argument comes off more like paranoia.

Gays should embrace their difference and chose to create a word that elevates gay unions above the divorce wrought hetero marriages.  The religious right thinks the word belongs to them. They're going to fight for it. Proposition 8 is indicative of how hard they are willing to fight. They are willing to go to the mat. They are not going to roll over. This battle is going to slow the gay community as they attempt to gain their rights. They need a fast track to their rights. Go around the religious right. Forget the word, get your rights now!

That usually goes a long way towards saving face later on if the assumption proves to be wrong.  Your argument is also based on emotion and it thus tries to manipulate the reader's feelings. This is done by calling one group bad; the straight people. You do do this by saying that ""straight people think they are more than we are."" You then call the other group good; the gay people. You do this by saying ""We wish it to mean exactly what the word 'Marriage' connotes and carries with it.""  I prefer arguments that are based on data and let the reader decide. There is no way to prove that gays wish marriage to mean exactly what it connotes and carries with it. There is also no way to prove that straight people think they are more than gays.

"Now, my view on the topic itself. I have three points:  Point one: I am a purist and I want the word 'marriage' to mean exactly what those who invented the word years ago defined it to be, ""A civil union between a man and a woman."" I don't want to change the meaning of the word to ""The loving union between two individuals.""     Point two: Just because someone wants something doesn't mean that they are entitled to it. So, no matter how noble gays may be, no matter how important the word is to them, they are not entitled to it.  Point three: Gays started this ""war"" by trying to take something they feel strongly about but are not necessarily entitled to. Straights responded like anyone who has had someone try to take something away that doesn't necessarily belonged to them. Gays want to force straights to share the word. But trying to force someone into doing something they don't want usually results in them resisting with equal or greater force.  I thus propose that gays create a new word and stop this ""war.""

You now have both of the words and/or statements by which the union is known. Does this mean we can have neither? If, as you state, we are not entitled to it then what shall people who wish to be married and enjoy a Civil Union be called? And why should it have to change? All any gay couple wishes to have are the things that are already defined by these words. If you change it, then you must define it. Then the ball starts to roll again in the direction of not being equal to Heterosexual people...but we are in all ways but one.  I, for one, am not in a war of any kind. I use logic and yes, I do use emotion along with logic in order to get some points across.

There were those who said blacks couldn't marry whites once upon a time. The same rhetoric was used against them. Gays are entitled to the word marriage just like anyone else because no one owns that word and any connotation that you ascribe to that word has a historical context that has changed over time and will change more over time.

Racists did not try to claim ownership of the word. The racists tried to change the definition of the word and lost. As they should have.

"Historically marriage is a property arrangement wherein a man takes possession of a woman. This has led to forced marriages and polygamy being the norm for thousands of years up to this day in many parts of the world. What you call marriage is a western idea. Western society has changed the definition of marriage a lot to suit their society just like any society does. Considering womena's sufferge wasn't that long ago as far as history is concerned it's suprising that you think marriage has always been a equal union. No, actually it's naive.  On your point about blacks: They had to be allowed equal protection under the law before that could happen. Google: Jim Crow.  The racist were upholding the traditional norm that blacks were subhuman and shouldn't marry whites. You just don't seem to get it. People thought marriage didn't include them at the time either. You are looking at the whole thing backwards. The word is changed constantly through history and those against the change are always on the wrong side of it.

"I never said anything about marriage traditionally being an equal union. I said that it was a union between a man and a woman and that part has remained constant. But I like the way you twisted my words in order to call me naive.  Now you insinuate that heterosexuals consider homosexuals as subhumans and thus don't want them to marry. That's an assumption. You're assuming to know  ""the real reason""  why some heterosexuals don't want to allow homosexuals to use the word marriage. Heterosexuals say that the reason they don't want gays to marry is because marriage has traditionally been a union between a man and a woman. You seem to be calling these heterosexuals liars and racists who consider gays to be subhuman.  So, to recap, your argument is based on discrediting me by calling me naive and appealing to the reader's emotions by insinuating that heterosexuals are racists. I tend to find these types of arguments as weak. I mean, name calling and trying to manipulate people's emotions instead of letting your argument stand alone on its merit is weak.  I understand your argument that the word marriage has changed in definition over time and thus there's a precedence for changing it once again. But the changes you site are minor and the underlying definition [the foundation, if you will] has never changed. It has always been between a man and a woman.

"As far as your ""separate is not equal"" statement, it simply does not apply to this situation.   That statement applied to the situation between blacks and whites. One example (for illustrations purposes) is schooling. The idea was that blacks would have their own schools and whites would have their own school. But since at that time whites were more affluent than blacks, their children were able to enjoy a higher level of education.  In the current situation heterosexual couples are not necessarily more affluent than gays. There's no reason to assume that a heterosexual union would be better than a homosexual union. There's also no reason to assume that by calling a homosexual union a ""marriage"" that they will receive a ""higher level"" of benefits than if they just called it a civil union. Therefore, the statement ""separate but equal"" does not apply.

"I don't know if you've been reading all of my arguments on this topic but what I'm proposing is for the government to stop using the word ""marriage"" and replace it with the words ""civil union"" and have those 2 words apply to heterosexual and homosexual unions. This would give homosexual unions the same rights as heterosexual unions.  However, If the government were to take this advice, the churches would still be able to deny to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies. In this case gays don't miss out on any ""rights"" because a wedding ceremony [performed by a representative of a given religion] is not a right.  If the government were to use the word ""marriage"" for homosexual unions, then would churches be required to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies? If so, wouldn't this mean that the government is telling the church what it can and cannot do? Is it a good idea for the government to get into the ""business"" of religion? And if the churches are forced to perform homosexual weddings, would gay couples automatically be accepted by the congregation?

"Joe, I appreciate you compliments and I hope you know that I really do appreciate a lot of your ideas.   As for this argument, you present a very unique perspective. Allow me to respond though.  Although it is true that people often want what they can't have, this does not always mean that their demands are unreasonable. Allow me to first use the example of the American Revolution. You will often hear people say, ""we defeated British tyranny over us etc..."" What a lot of people don't realize is that we had it pretty good under the British. We had extremely low taxes, protection from others, and a reliable trading partner. Now a lot of stuff happened but the condensed version is, we wanted more: ""Taxation w/out representation"" and the like. So we had it pretty good already, but we wanted something more: liberty, inalienable rights, representative government. These are the foundations of our society today, but had we accepted what was going on at the time they may never have come to fruition.  Another example would be woman's suffrage. The common idea at the time (or at least rationalization) was that women would vote the same as their husbands so their right to vote was irrelevant. This idea seems archaic to us today, but back then it was the accepted norm. Progress eventually won out and woman gained the right that is most necessary to a democracy: the right to vote.  In both of these cases we can see how the status quo seems fine to a large number of people because it is what they are used to. Others though, see that there is an injustice occurring, and step up to fix it. I believe this explains why so many oppose gay marriage more than anything else. It is what has always been, why change it. I know you are a conservative, so know that I mean no offense when I say that conservative viewpoints have stood in the way of positive change throughout history. It is not bigotry that kept allowed slavery to continue (although that played a role) it is inaction and complacency.  Now we see the same scenario repeated. A group has been denied certain rights and now they are asking for them. You used the word militant, and I have to disagree with its connotations. African Americans were called militant when they demanded civil rights during the 60's, were they just being greedy? Or were they standing up and demanding that they be given what was promised to them as children: that all men are created equal, no different from our founding fathers who stood up during the revolution and demanded their rights.   No different then now, where a group of people want to have their love recognized under the law. They want to be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness. I think that your right on one count, that is human nature. It is human nature to want acceptance, and to want equality, and to want a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted.  I hope you see why I am upset at those people who prevent these people from the happiness they seek, and why I call them bigots. There crime is all too common, an inability to put yourself in your neighbors shoes. An inability to recognize the humanity of others. An inability to empathize with their suffering in a society that does not fully accept them.

"The specific thing you requested was for me to give you a legitimate reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion. I did that.   You said that, ""I feel that bigotry or ignorance are the only reasons to oppose this issue."" I thought I gave a perfect example where this was not the case. Some people just don't want to be around other people. That does not make them a bigot nor does it make them ignorant. Not granting gays the word marriage but granting them the same rights does not make one a bigot nor does it make one ignorant  nor does it hurt the gay community.   You say that same but separate is not good enough as though as soon gays are allowed to marry the bigots will suddenly see the errors of their ways. That's not going to happen. All the litigation in the world will never force a bigot to accept you. He will just look at you in the eye, turn around, and roll his eyes.  My argument does not call people names. Your argument calls anyone opposed to gay marriage a bigot or ignorant.   The side you're on is considered liberal. The side I'm on is seen as conservative. I don't categorize my argument as conservative because it takes a middle of the road approach.  Take a little  (your rights)  give a little  (leave the word behind). This is what I call negotiation. The side you're on is not interested in negotiation and is seen as militant; it's a ""my way or the highway"" approach and then your side acts surprised when they encounter resistance.  The side your on wants people to put themselves in their shoes but they are not willing to put themselves in the shoes of the other side.  The side I'm on is seen as being based on religion. I don't categorize my argument as being based on religion because my argument does not invoke religion. It invokes human nature. My argument is also constructive in that it alienates a smaller group on the religious right. It is pragmatic and rational in that it gets gays their rights sooner and all they are leaving on the table is just a word.  People can want all they want. I never said it was unreasonable. I just think that it is not practical at this point in time as evidence by proposition 8. I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost? Take your time, regroup, do a ""lessons learned"" analysis of what went wrong and why and then try again later.  People can want all they want but that does not mean that they are entitled to it or that they deserve it or that they have a right to it.  The status quo does not seem right to me. Otherwise I would never have suggested to bypass them. I saw an injustice occurring and I tried to think of a pragmatic approach towards getting what I consider important and leaving behind what I don't consider important in the shortest amount of time. That was my contribution. That was my way of stepping up to the plate and trying to fix things and I got slammed. This explains why others that have tried to help the gay community but encountered the negative feed back have stopped supporting gay marriage more than anything else.   What allowed slavery to continue was not inaction and complacency. People were working towards fixing it. What allowed slavery to continue for as long as it did is that it takes time to change the world.   The gay community is not asking for certain rights, it is demanding them. The gay community is not interested in negotiating and this stance is alienating a lot of potential allies. The gay community is taking an in your face approach and are surprised when the other side responds in kind.  The group that followed Martin Luther King were not militant. The Black Panthers were.  The gays that are peacefully trying to advance their agenda are not militant. The ones vandalizing churches are.  The gay community wants to portray itself as being the new civil rights fighters of our generation. The black community finds this highly offensive. What is the worst a gay man has had to openly endure in the last 10 years and compare that to what a black man had to endure during the 60's. There's no comparison. The gay community as the new civil rights fighters of our generation is an exaggeration; it is a tactic meant to get them what they want, nothing else.  No one promised gays the right to marriage. They can have their love legally recognized under a different name and not suffer because of it. They can be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness without the having the word marriage. The word marriage will not magically get them to be acceptance nor get them a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted. They have to find happiness within themselves. No one can grant it to them so no one can deny it to them.  I hope you see why I am upset at those hypocritical gays that say ""empathize with our suffering in a society that does not fully accept us"" and then turn around and vandalize churches. Now that is a real crime and it is not very accepting of the other side. I don't think they are empathizing with the other side, do you? I guess they forgot to put on their neighbors shoes.   Do you think that when gays call the other side hateful and bigot and ignorant that they are able to see the humanity of the other side? Does maligning someone help you solve your differences or does it hinder? And if it hinders, why do it. What value is there in calling someone a bigot? It is a great tactic. The Nazis used it with great success to get people to think that it was OK to kill Jews because, after all, Jews were vermin. You see?

"Okay, let me first make it clear that I never condoned violent action as a way to solve the problem. Gandhi and MLK Jr. are some of my heroes because they affected change in the most peaceful ways possible. What I also liked about them is they both recognized injustice and stood up to it without compromise. Gandhi wanted the British out of India and did not compromise on this issue. Martin Luther King wanted equal rights for African-Americans and did not compromise. There is a  big  difference between not wanting to compromise, and being narrow minded.   You say ""Some people just don't want to be around other people."" This to me is a type of discrimination. If I told you, I am not bigoted, I just don't want to be around Mexicans, you would be appalled.  Here is the definition of a bigot in wikipedia:   A bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own   Looking at this definition you can see clearly that not wanting to be around people who choose to be homosexual is bigotry. But that is irrelevant because   no one is forcing people to be around homosexuals  . This is what I don't understand about your argument. If homosexuals get married does that mean suddenly they are going to suddenly show up at your door, and when you refuse them say ""Hey, you have to let us in, we're legally married now."" That is ridiculous.  Of course legalizing gay marriage will not automatically get rid of bigots, I never said that and I don't believe it. When slavery was abolished, did it get rid of racism? When woman's suffrage was granted, did it get rid of sexism? No! But in the long run it helped  a lot . Can you imagine anyone believing either of these issues as having two reasonable sides today? The bigots will not change their mind, but their children will be raised in a society that is more accepting, and hopefully this will have a large affect for future generations.  Being intolerant of bigotry cannot be called bigotry.  I agree that maybe gay marriage will not come to fruition in the immediate future, but that does not mean that people should stop fighting for what they believe in. Martain Luther King demanded equal rights for African-Americans. Feminists demanded equal rights for women. Asking nicely, ""can we please get married, if it isn't to much of a problem for you?""   Of course what blacks suffered through in the pre-civil rights era was terrible. That does not lessen what homosexuals are going through right now. I know from seeing it at my school how much homosexuals are mistreated and outcast. This is socially acceptable,  and it shouldn't be . Progress will probably be attained in smaller steps but only if people continue to fight for their rights. Obama is the perfect example of this: in order to win the presidency he had to support civil unions but not gay marriage. Lucky for me, I'm not a politician. I don't have to temper my views with the current public will. I can say what I truly believe. If a compromise were reached in the federal government that extended rights to homosexuals through civil unions I would be in favor of that, but after it was passed I would go right back to fighting for marriage. Homosexuals even lost the ability to adopt in Arkansas because they can't marry or even have civil unions:   http://outtheotherear.wordpress. com/2008/08/26/ spotlight-arkansas-gay-adoption/    I also have a problem with you comparing the Homosexuals to the Nazis. First, the Nazis killed homosexuals, because they thought they were, to use your word, ""vermin."" What the homosexuals are not doing is killing or hurting others in any way by demanding marriage. By denying them marriage, other people are hurting homosexuals. So who is more like the Nazi's now? Don't you think its justified to loathe your oppressors? This does not mean violence, as I said earlier I am against violence.  Speaking of Bigotry though, I want you to see what homosexuals have to put up with:   http://www.godhatesfags.com/   Is it unfair for me to call them bigots, or am I being narrow minded?  Finally I would like to respond to this comment you made:   I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost?   And I can only respond with this quote:   ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.""  -Edmund Burke

"So by your definition everyone is a bigot, including yourself, because I can probably come up with a group of people that you don't want to be around.  However, a closer look at the definition of the bigot will clearly show that it is possible for a person to not want to be around a group of people for reasons other than intolerance of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own. For example, I do not want to be around people that don't speak my language because I would rather be something else rather than trying to make myself be understood or trying to understand what they were saying. And if we are just supposed to be sitting there saying nothing, I would still rather be something else.  BTW, I think that it is convenient that:  ""Being intolerant of bigotry cannot be called bigotry.""

"Soccer, you're floundering. lets keep it short and sweet.  The specific thing you requested from me was to give you a legitimate reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion. I did that. You still claim that  every person that is opposed to gay marriage is a bigot  (period). if you don't think that my reason is legitimate, then say so and we'll debate that.  I never said that people should stop fighting for their rights. I said that they should take the high road, which is a slower, longer road. Take the Gandhi road, the Martin Luther king road instead of the low road that may get you there faster. Don't take the ""If you are against us you are "" road. The low road is a tactic used to get you there faster.  If I recall correctly, I did not compare homosexuals to Nazis. I said that the tactics being used are the same tactics that the Nazis used. This tactic can be used for good. The tactic itself is not evil. The gay movement is not the first to use that tactic. I don't like the tactic.  I think that calling  everyone  who is opposed to gay marriage a bigot is unfair and narrow minded.  When I said, ""gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost?"" What I mean is,  That the ends do not justify the means. Calling people a bigot in order to get your way is uncalled for.   I've told you in the past when I have up voted you and why. This is the first time I have ever down voted someone. But I respect you enough to explain why I'm doing it. I'm down voting you for insisting that  everyone  who is opposed to gay marriage is a bigot even after I have given you one reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion and you did chose not to respond to that. Your position implies to me that the ends justify the means. I think you can do better than that.  no hard feelings. Peace out ;)

"Okay good Chad, let us apply this definition to my previous contentious argument with you. I argued that anal sex and also using a plastic/wooden/steel rod in a sexual act are irrational. Further Chad, when we are aroused, our body reacts by producing lubrication in preparation for intercourse. Therefore using other body parts in sexual acts are irrational, don't you think? Morality constrains us, it qualifies right and wrong, it not alien to us it's built-in, coded, programming into our humanity. The concept of the original position is based upon this inalienable human trait. Moralism (which we both obviously hate) is a bully, it attempts to devour and threaten others. Therefore don't confuse morality which is innate with the hypocritical self-promoting moralism. In addition Chad, my view is in the minority now, because of the shifting goal post, look at the Argument Ratio or the Debate info above.

"OK, so now you're saying that you follow the crowd instead of making up your own mind.  Think about this. In any given argument, to use absolutes is usually wrong. To say that ""everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot"" is wrong. To say that ""everyone else says that everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot so it must be true"" is wrong.   Are you saying that it is physically impossible for someone to be against gay marriage for some reason other than being a bigot?  Think about this. If it were a true statement that anyone who doesn't want to be around a specific group is a bigot, then why doesn't the definition of the word say that? Could it be that there are plenty of other reasons for people not to want to be around a specific group? What if you were shy and only wanted to hang around your own kind? What if you were deaf and only wanted to hang around deaf people? What if people with tinnitus wanted to be called deaf and deaf people were opposed, would they be bigots?

"I just spent the last five minutes looking through my arguments seeing if I could find where I said ""everyone who opposes gay marriage is a bigot"" and guess what? I wasted my time! Don't put things in quotes as if I said them when I clearly didn't. If you want to use quotes copy and paste, I have written plenty of stuff, I'm sure you can find something that will go to prove your point.  If I am understanding you correctly, here is your argument:  People are not being bigoted just because they don't want to be around people.  Am I right so far? Because I agree with this part. Next you say:  some people who don't want gays to get married only because they don't want to be around them.  Is this correct? Because I think you might be right that this could be some peoples reasons. No one is asking them to hang out with homosexuals, or even talk to them so I don't understand their rationale, but at least it's an explanation. So so far we agree.  Now here's where your logic decides to jump off a cliff into a pile of razor blades after having swallowed a gallon of vodka and three bottles of sleeping pills:  People are not being bigoted, or intolerant when they allow their discomfort of being around gays to affect their decisions as to whether gays should be allowed to get married.  Is this the basic point your making? If not ignore the rest of the argument and clarify your position, but if so keep reading.   Denying others rights because you don't like their lifestyle   is intolerant and bigoted  . I may not like people with your opinions but I would  never  try to take away your right to voice them. Here is where the difference lies. You are allowed to be uncomfortable with how people live. I admit, I would be pretty uncomfortable around a man who wore nothing but a thong all day, but I wouldn't take away his rights. I could decide not to hang out with the thong-man. I might purposefully avoid him, but I would not take away his rights or the rights of all the thong-men in the entire state. Why? Because I know that if  my  lifestyle was not the popular or accepted one then I would not want people trampling on my rights.  Your metaphor is an inaccurate one for two reasons: A) there is no logic in a groups wanting to change the name of their condition; and (this is the important one) B) homosexuals aren't forcing anything on people, merely asking for the same rights as afforded to others. A change in the name of your condition does not afford you more rights. (I considered including a C that said your an idiot but I didn't think that would add anything to my argument)

"First off sharpiron, I don't have anything against you as a person. But have you looked at the world lately, it is already to the point that sexual deviants thrive in this world. That isn't gay peoples fault. The fact that molestation, insert, rape and child pornography and adultery happen is proof of that. Very few are ever held accountable for their actions. Politicians are caught doing it all the time, and its passed off as a ""simple mistake"". Especially if it is a heterosexual act.   The act of allowing two men or two women to marry does not hurt anyone or even family values, because we just want the same thing straight people already have and take for granted. Acceptance in this world to be able to love whom we want to love. Monogamous, loving relationships with someone of the same gender. We want families and children and the love and respect and adoration from someone who pledges their life to us as we pledge our life to them.   I was raised in a loving Christian home, my grandmother was my preacher until I was 30. I love God and always have even from the time I was a small child. I was raised to believe that all homosexuals were going to hell and that the only cure was a good woman. So at the age of 20 I married. I cried and prayed many nights for God to make the thought of a man be repulsive to me and after 11 years of marriage I finally realized I was gay and had been all along. My feelings for men had been with me since I was young, the first memory I have was at the age of 11. I so desperately wanted to fit in, to be accepted by my family, to go to Heaven. It took me 19 years to realize that I am still God's child and he loves me, even as a gay man. It was definitely hard to understand after years of being told how horrible and wrong all gay people were, only to realize I had been trying to be something I wasn't and it was slowly killing me from the inside out. Many times I just prayed for God to kill me. But it never came. Once I finally accepted who I was, who I had always been, God gave me the peace I needed.  My own mother stated she wished she had never had me and most of my blood relatives have nothing to do with me. You know the scripture that says to not be unequally yoked, well apparently my love for God wasn't enough. I was escorted from my church and told not to come back until I was ready to renounce my sexuality and come back to the fold. I don't blame God for what others do in his name. I am sad that my family isn't judgement free like they claim to be. I am sad that they will never know the man I love and have loved faithfully for over two years. I plan to marry him, with or without a marriage certificate. The way I see it, Adam and Eve didn't need a piece of paper to be married, and neither do I. Marriage is a state of mind and a way of life. Even the most married people fall into infidelity because the words they spake didn't mean anything. So gay or straight if your heart isn't in it, is it really a marriage.   I wish everyone would just worry about themselves and recognize the hurt they cause by telling others to do as they say and not what they do. I hope everyone out there that may read this can get the sense that I am Gay, I am in a loving relationship with a man, I am a God fearing and God loving man. And God loves me for who I am, not what the world thinks I should be.

"Gay ""marriage"" doesn't hurt anyone in a sense that it threatens traditional marriage (that between a man and woman). I say ""marriage"" in reference to gay ""marriage"" because marriage is understood to be between a man and woman in the very sense of the term, as a religious term. Gay's should be allowed to commit to one another and in a sense assume responsibility that a husband and wife would.

"First of all, the two options for this debate are a bit limiting and ambiguous. If we define ""hurt"" as directly set back or disadvantage, then no, gay marriage doesn't hurt even the most vehement of bigots. However, if we define ""hurt"" as having any influence in which a person may deem negative to themselves, then yes, it is very possible that it does.  I've sided with the ""doesn't hurt anyone"" because in GENERAL and DIRECTLY it does not influence people who oppose it.  John and Jim getting married and having sex behind closed doors, does not affect the daily life of big Pastor Joe in a direct way.  However, the long term social and political effects will have very real consequences for both Pastor Joe and the rest of society.  If we examine the effects of abortion laws, especially the revision those of 1973, we see how it is possible for legislation intending to provide more individual freedoms may affect the social dynamic. The 1.7 million abortions a year are seen with a more liberal attitude after Roe and other similar historic legal moments.  Compare the average attitude on abortion in 1920 to today, and you will find that the social dynamic has changed. As society becomes more liberal on a certain issue because of legislation, it is possible that Pastor Joe is now surrounded with a warped culture he does not enjoy. This culture, the effects of gay marriage, may very possibly ""hurt"" Pastor Joe in the sense that he is not happy with the effects of allowing it, later down the road.  Forced to chose one of the absolutist sides, ""Doesn't hurt anyone"" -- In general, right now, if John and Jim wish to go get a married, this does not influence my life. In an ideal philosophy, the actions of two consenting adults in private are of no business to anyone but themselves, thus ""doesnt hurt anyone.""

"I want to point out a seldom talked about but nevertheless very important point:  Gay marriage absolutely does erode ""family"", and here is why: the church - the summation of all religious institutions - wants to control the relationship between children and parents. This is of utmost importance to the church, because parents are the most reliable tool of mass religious indoctrination; and because much of the ""sacred"" beliefs are delivered as interaction between parents and children, which the followers are supposed to model. This is why the church seeks to control both licensing to procreation (marriage) and procreation itself (promiscuity, abortions, gay marriage). Anyone who treads on these interests of the church is opposed by the church because losing any of these defense lines directly reduces the church's market which is never going to come back.   Gay marriage does exactly what the conservatives are complaining about: the necessity to allow gay people to marry means taking away the marriage prerogative from the church. It directly results in less believers and thus harms the religious thought as a whole.  Gay marriage destroys marriage and traditional values, and that's why it's a great thing.

"What people like you don't get is that people who are legally married to a member of the same sex usually want to adopt. The child of the couple is going to be hurt mentally because it is healthy for a child to grow up in a household with one mom and one dad. The mom and the dad each contribute something to how the child acts and feels. Without either a mom or a dad the child is mentally hurt because they do not have that influence. I am not saying the child is mentally retarded, but it is much more healthy to have one mom and one dad. I sometimes will say that I support the right to marry but not to adopt.  My problem with that statement, though, is that the bible makes references where it says that a marrige is to be strictly between only one man and one woman.

Furthermore what about single parents? Should they be allowed to have kids or adopt? My guess is you think so. They are not getting the influence of both a mom and dad, just like you think how same-sex couples raise kids, so what's the difference?  The bible should never be any justification for laws.

"I utterly and irrefutably agree with your view. My concern has always been the emotional, social, mental and particularly the psychological wellbeing of the child. For instance, one growing up with two fathers would merely destroy their sense of belonging. Consider the bullies out there, those who do discriminate on the basis of one’s sexuality. Although I’m against discrimination, I think it’s undoubtedly wrong to be married to someone of the same gender as you. It does in fact mentally hurt a child, to the extent where their perspective on life is altered as they age, wishing they had two heterosexual parents. They themselves would begin to ponder on whether ‘Gay marriage’ and ‘Homosexuality’ is acceptable and serves as ‘normal’. It’s so sad to see that there is a significant rise in Gay marriages, somewhat indicating humankind has lost all respect for their true purpose and ultimately, for God. The Bible, a sacred text which all knowledge is derived from, acts as a source of teaching. This teaching encapsulates the wrongness of homosexuality and places emphasis on the fact that one will not be able to inherit the kingdom of God if they are homosexual. We all know this. Although one cannot rely on the Bible to teach them absolutely EVERYTHING about life as not all is contained, we must also have common sense and recognize that gay marriage is not natural. Despite the so-called ‘love’ that supposedly exists between the two so-called ‘lovers’ who are led to believe that one of them plays the role of a ‘girl’ whilst the other wears the pants, my point is: Gay marriage does not serve to fulfil the purpose of a real marriage which is PROCREATION. Adopting a child is far worse, bringing an innocent human-being into your life to illustrate and teach to them your own wrong-doings, consequently influencing them to view it as acceptable. Please man, where’s the brains.

I vote against Gay marriage and I vote against ANY form of marriage where two people must register their union with the government.

I am opposed to gay marriage for a couple of very specific reasons, but I am in the theater business and of about 30 guys who are my close friends, 29 of them are probably gay, and I love them like crazy!  So again I want to say that, to use the debates words (although I think they are a little inflammatory), gay marriage does hurt everyone for the following reason: The prominent justification for gay marriage is that it is a right and that denying it will take away the rights of a minority, similar to the civil rights movement. Using this justification, any religious group that denies gays participation or clergy or marriage will be branded as persecuting homosexuals. The scary thing is that there are some people reading this right now and thinking ""yes, that would be discrimination and homophobia and should be stopped."" I just read a quote:  'Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor and gay activist who helps draft federal legislation related to sexual orientation, says that, when religious liberty conflicts with gay rights, “I’m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.”'  http://article.nationalreview.com/ ?q=YTU5MjZmMDIyMDU3NjRiMjBlNjcxYTlmOGQ2 ODA5NjA=   (an altogether fetching article which says this entire thing much better than I have)  Gay marriage is an immediate threat to our freedoms AS IT IS CURRENTLY being pursued. The owners of eharmony.com are REQUIRED to provide gay matchmaking. They have no freedom to do otherwise. Doctors who provide in vitro fertilization are REQUIRED to do it for lesbian couples, even if this is against their beliefs. These doctors have lost their freedom.  Now gay marriage DOESN'T have to be this way. Pass legal laws which respect the beliefs of others. As I said, i love my gay friends, and I might be ok with some of them marrying (I say might because of all of these people, I can think of only one couple that even pretends to be serious about their relationship, and I think they are adorable! The others shouldn't marry imo, whether they are gay or straight or anything because they aren't serious, but that's just my opinion and it's honestly none of my business :). So as i said, go ahead and pass the laws, but don't take away the rights of others to believe that homosexuality is wrong, because THAT is what is against the constitution.

"Hmmmm.   I have put my views out there (made a stand). Maybe it's hard to distinguish when I'm kidding and when I'm being serious.   Here's my position on the subject.   I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word ""married.""   Would you rather use the word ""married"" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash.   The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them.   The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them.   The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.  The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right.   I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.  Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.  One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.  God give me the strength to change the things I can,  the patience to put it with the things I can't,  and the wisdom to know the difference.

Looks like we should reread the Constitution. And also understand what anti-discrimination laws do. They DO not require a person be less bigoted, but only require they not be guided by their prejudices to a point where they deny another human being of their equal rights under the law. CRA of 1964 didn't stop anyone set on being a bigot from doing so.  While it's quite easy to capitalize words like FREEDOM and think we are making a stunning point, we must remember that it is impossible for everyone everywhere to have the freedoms he or she would want. Rights and freedoms and privileges will always contradict. Thus, we all have to look around and agree as a society that we will value other human beings and chose not to deprive them of certain rights, especially in favor of our deleterious 'freedoms.'   Remember that not of the 'rights' that we have in American (speech, etc.) are really natural, but the product of a country that was based on the ideals that all men were created equal, working towards the goal of a 'more perfect union' by canonizing laws that are in line with that humanitarian ideal.

Anyway, I looked it up and it seems nature and nuture both play a role:  ""There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.""   http://www.apa.org/topics/ sorientation.html

",1
"You also don't become gay from ""influences from your peers and society."" There is at this point more evidence that supports biological and genetic reasons for a person being homosexual. (Identical twins are considerably more likely to have the same sexual orientation, sexual preference can be changed in rats, fruit flies, and other animals with simpler minds, a gay man's brain has characteristics that look more like a straight female""s, and so on and so on.) However, sexuality is one of the most complex psychological processes of humanity and thus there is not a conclusive answer on the whole nature vs. nurture argument. So basically your statement is ""unfounded"" as well.

This would open the doorway for sexual deviants to molest your children and womenfolk with their eyes once they don't touch. I was once told that in a perfect world unisex toilets would be fine, but our society isn’t.

"Gay Parenting Does Affect Children Differently, Study Finds  -- Authors Believe Gay Parents Have ""Some Advantages""  Taking issue with 20 years of research conclusions that say there are no differences, two University of California sociologists recently re-examined data from 21 studies on gay parenting dating back to 1980.   The new study by two University of Southern California sociologists says children with lesbian or gay parents show more empathy for social diversity, are less confined by gender stereotypes, and are probably more likely to explore homosexual activity themselves. Writing in recent issue of the American Sociological Review, the authors say that the emotional health of the two sets of children is essentially the same.   Leaders of national gay-affirming groups said they welcomed the article, according to an Associated Press story. ""I'm thrilled that they're tackling these issues,"" said Aimee Gelnaw, executive director of the Family Pride Coalition, who is a lesbian parent raising two children with her partner. ""Of course our kids are going to be different,"" Gelnaw said. ""They're growing up in a different social context.""   Openness to Gay Relationships  Met With ""Elation""  Kate Kendall, head of the San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights, also is raising two children with her partner. ""There's only one response to a study that children raised by lesbian and gay parents may be somewhat more likely to reject notions of rigid sexual orientation -- that response has to be elation,"" Kendall said.   But Amy Desai, a policy analyst with the group Focus on the Family, said the new report is alarming in its suggestions that children of gay parents might be more open to homosexual activity. ""Kids do best when they have a married mother and a married father,"" she said.   A Home With No Dad is Better?  The study's co-author, Judith Stacey, is a professor of contemporary gender studies. In addition to pointing out the gender differences in the two groups of children, she states that there are in fact some advantages to an all-female parental team without Dad living in the home: a female couple tends to be more involved in the children's lives and is in greater harmony in terms of parenting approaches.   Among the findings cited by the authors:   1. Compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They show greater interest in activities with both masculine and feminine qualities. They have higher aspirations to occupations that are not traditionally female.   2. In terms of aggression and play, sons of lesbians behave in less traditionally masculine ways. They are likely to be more nurturing and affectionate than their counterparts in heterosexual families.   3. One study examined by the researchers indicated that a significantly greater proportion of young adult children raised by lesbians had engaged in a same-sex relationship (six of 25 interviewed) than those raised by a heterosexual mother (none of 20 interviewed).   4. Those raised by lesbian mothers were also more likely to consider a homosexual relationship.   5. Teen-age and young adult girls raised by lesbian mothers appear to be more sexually adventurous and less chaste than girls raised by heterosexual mothers. Sons, on the other hand, were somewhat less sexually adventurous and more chaste than boys raised by heterosexuals.   6. The studies indicate that sexual orientation has no measurable effect on the quality of parent-child relationships or on the mental health of children.   ""These studies find no significant differences between children of lesbian and heterosexual mothers in anxiety, depression, self-esteem and numerous other measures of social and psychological adjustment,"" said the authors.   NARTH""s Joseph Nicolosi offered the following comments: ""This paper was authored by a professor of gender studies, so it is not surprisingly that the differences on which she focused have to do with a rejection of gender conformity. Indeed, what she found makes sense -- lesbian mothers tend to have a feminizing effect on their sons, and a masculinizing effect on their daughters.   ""But the question is, are these differences healthy? More research is needed to understand how a rejection of conventional gender roles can have not just a healthy and expansive, but also a constricting and negative effect on identity and psychological health.   ""And despite what many gender researchers claim, research tells us that the absence of a father in the home is not, on balance, good for families.""

"So because a homosexual family does not fit the traditional definition of family they shouldn't be allowed to have kids? Orphans who have no parents are better off than if they have two parents who happen to be of the same sex?  Trust me when I say, no kids are hurt by having homosexual parents. I know first hand and many researchers have shown that two parents, regardless of gender, are better off then one or no parents.   Also what activities are you talking about?

Stop acting as if you are some poor put upon person because God forbid, some human being that you don't approve of is happy. Get a life.  Let me ask you this. Do you revere your marriage so much that you have you marriage license framed and hanging in your living room, signed by everyone at your wedding? Do you keep that prominent and show it off to everyone as a testament to your commitment to another human being, whom you love greatly? Do you pass by it every day, smile, think deeply, and reaffirm that love?  No? Well, I have two gay friends who do, and they've been together for about 20 years. How dare you suggest that you somehow get to have a say in their love and commitment for each other. Who the hell asked you? No one passed judgment on your love, why do you defy Jesus himself by judging others.

"The only way it could possibly ""hurt"" anyone is if someone let themselves be hurt by this upcoming acceptance of Gays into society. We had the same issues with blacks integrading into society and women getting voting rights. The only reason it could possibly hurt someone is if they have a stubborn view on the world that makes them believe gays are in the wrong and should not be allowed the same rights as heterosexual people. ""History must repeat itself because we pay such little attention to it the first time."" That is what is happening right now.

"""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."" —Genesis 1:27  Our Lord, in His answer to the Pharisees concerning divorce, refers to this passage in Genesis and confirms its special application to marriage. ""Have ye not read,"" He said, ‘that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.""' Marriage is derived from the Lord, for male and female. It has its highest and perfect form in Him, for in Him love and wisdom are one.  So how can gay marriage hurt any one? This is a very deep, complicated question and answer. (And please know, anyone that believes they are gay out there, I am not judging you. You are not horrible, and it is only my responsibility to share the truth of God's word to those who may stray from it or don't understand it.) It hurts God, don't you see? All sin does. Whenever man decides what is actually right and moral for himself, independent of God's wisdom, he always hurts himself because he has disconnected himself from God's plan for his life. And if he strays from God's plan, the course he takes can affect all of humanity—like the domino effect.  I take it for certain that the physical satisfaction of homosexual desires is sin. However, this leaves the homosexual person no worse off than any heterosexual person who is, for whatever reason, prevented from marrying, or from participating in sex outside the sanctity of marriage. Or any other sin for that matter.  People—primarily the homosexual community—say, ""Who are others to say who we should be able to love?"" (or in this case, marry) Let me ask you this: Have we not all loved our our same-sex friends as much as we've loved the opposite sex? I have loved my friends as much, sometimes more than a mate (after all, the opposite sex is oh so confusing at times!) But the difference is we do not desire to have sex with them. Aha—therein lies the heart of the controversy over homosexuality, and homosexual ""marriages."" You see the truth is, it's not about ""love""—it is about sex, and who these people desire to love, is who they desire to have sex with. I can already hear everyone saying, ""So what?! Of course people want to have sex with whomever they love..."" But no. Sex has been perverted and removed from its original design. First we love, then we marry, then we consummate our marriage (it is just the icing) and the marriage (the love) is preserved through commitment before God. Again, I hear folks saying ""Well that's what homosexuals want to do!""   First, we must understand that love begins with God. So many people misread and misuse Scripture and quote Jesus as saying, in regard to what the highest commandments are, ""... to love thy neighbor as thyself..."" for their arguments. But note that Jesus says, ""commandmentS""—plural. Immediately proceeding ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" He says the first and greatest commandment is ""You shall love thy Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."" [Following is the second greatest commandment] ""Love thy neighbor as thyself."" So if homosexuals reject God's teachings on love and marriage and sex, how then can they use the argument that 'they just want to be able to love whomever they want' ? —They actually want to have sex with whomever they want, otherwise they would just remain the best of friends, you see? That is not the same. And then, they want to take it a step further, and sanctify it in holy marriage. This is re-writing the Bible to suit their own desires which is strictly forbidden.   People may love whomever they want. They just can't have sex with whomever they want. Well, actually they CAN—there is free will. Some say they were born this way. I say that in some cases this is actually true. In many cases it is a choice. But let's say they were born that way. There are alcoholics and depressed persons and naturally promiscuous persons and all kinds of burdens passed on in birth—this is what's called ""our cross to bare""... Sometimes we have to make the choice to sacrifice an urge or desire to sin and in turn use this struggle for the good of all. Or we can succumb to it and let the consequences fall where they may. But I'd say 98% of our population has some sort of dilemma to struggle with. Like all other tribulations, it must be offered to God for His guidance on how best to use it.  And the American government has made separation of church and state very clear. They must, therefore, be consistent. The government has no right to redefine marriage in its holy context. If they stepped in and redefined marriage, a whole bunch of other decisions they've made concerning separation of church and state (removing the flag from classrooms, the commandments from courthouses, etc.) would then have to be reversed. They can't have it both ways, and they know this.   Peace.

"There are 2 shot and simple points to be made.  Firstly, is that there is no need to run a country based on religion, this happened in Saudi Arabia and look at the crime, injustice and autocracy there, quite simply we should run a nation based on what the majority deem to be acceptable, in the case of my country, the UK, gay marriage is acceptable, murder and rape are not.  Secondly, people do NOT choose to be gay, scientific evidence shows that people are born GAY, would you not allow a person with dyslexia or downs syndrome to marry? They are born different to us.  To sum up, anyone who feels that it is wrong is being over religious and fundamentalist, we cannot let a 2000 year old book with no known author govern the freedoms we have. A simple referendum will fix things.

"To respond to your first point: Your argument actually proves God's point where Jesus says there is ""only way to come to the Father, and that is through the person of Jesus Christ""—not Mohammed, and that those in positions of power and authority will be judged more harshly, so that may be what's going on over there? That's not saying that there aren't peaceful and loving Muslims—it's saying that a nation is being ran via Islam by it's governing powers, which, according to Scripture, brings ruin upon itself by dismissing the person and holiness of Jesus and teaching their entire people to dismiss it as well. I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera—oh wait, that would be Heaven. But sin is in the world and a country based on Christ's truth and faith and peace (not religion?) isn't going to happen here on earth. So we do the best we can with a democracy that guarantees protection of religion.  Your second point: I know for a fact that some people DO choose to ""be gay"" as one of my friends is newly gay, but didn't used to be, but after one too many hurts by the opposite sex and a desperate need to be cared for decided to give the other side a try. (And it should be noted that we hear each other's views on the subject with respect and agree to disagree but are still good friends.) There's also the perfect illustration of choosing in bisexuals, who can't seem to ""choose"" which sex they prefer. It is a choice in the end, even if it's an inclination one is born with, as I said in my original argument. I don't even begin to know how you came to compare gay marriage to allowing someone with dyslexia to marry? Re-read my original argument about the necessity of marriage being male/female. Marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman—it is not a civil union (although many treat it as such)—and that is why so many people have a problem with legalizing gay marriage. It would erode the foundation and meaning of marriage according to God, which is sacred to believers. You don't want to believe in God—hey, that's between you and Him and every human being has that free choice—no one is forcing or condemning anyone. All that believers are doing is defending their faith-based, holy sacraments so that others can't redefine them when they don't even believe in them. I mean there really is a contradiction there, right? Christians don't marry for financial reasons (at least they're not supposed to) or things like that—it is to pledge the marriage to God, to request His blessing.   Let me ask you something: What's wrong with homosexuality being a choice? I mean, if homosexuals are confident and proud of their sexual preference, why the need to say that the trait is inborn? Why all the shame?   ""Fundamentalism"" is defined as a strong adherence to any set of beliefs in the face of criticism and unpopularity. I am by no means a perfect Christian, but I am trying to be an authentic Christian and not a casual one, so I guess if that makes me a fundamentalist, then I guess I am? But be careful about labeling when you so clearly and ""fundamentally"" adhere to your own beliefs. Diversity goes both ways my friend. ;)  Oh, and Prop 8, was voted down by a democracy, not by religion—the majority deemed it not to be acceptable, to use your own words.

"Wow so much ignorance and hypocrisy to address.   ""I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etcetera""  Please observe the middle ages. That is probably an ideal time for Christians. Gays were killed. No science. Blasphemers were killed. Almost everyone was Christian. But I would hardly call it a time free of crime, pain, and suffering.  No one cares what you say your friends said that he thinks. There are so many possible errors in that statement it is mind boggling.  A) Your friend doesn't know why he is gay and is trying to come up with a reason  B) Your friend lied to you  C) You lied to us.  Being homosexual is not a choice. Regardless of the fact that it has been proven not to be as you are clearly ignoring that, why would anyone choose a lifestyle in which they experience intolerance just to sin and piss of god? You guys really need to learn logic.  Marriage by the government is not a holy union. In a church it is. And that is what you guys fail to realize. No one is arguing that marriages in churches should be between same-sex couples, you guys can do whatever your magic book tells you. However, according to the establishment clause of the United States Constitution, we cannot base our government off of religion. If we base marriage off of religion, how do we choose which one, maybe my religion says nobody can get married? Even if everyone in the country in Christian, which thankfully they aren't, we still cannot use the bible as justification for public policy, it is not legal.  You can mince words all you want, but Christianity is a religion and atheism is not.  And proposition 8 was passed by a campaign of fear mongering and large influence by the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints. That's totally irrelevant, however, because it doesn't matter how many people vote for something if it is unconstitutional. You don't seem to be very knowledgeable about the constitution so let me help you. Our system is not set up by majority rules. It is set up by majority rules with minority rights. The minority rights is not an afterthought it is at least as important. The framers of the constitution specifically set up the government to avoid the kind of religious and tyrannical persecution they experienced in England.

"""Homosexuality is genetic, and therefore evolved.""   Without looking into this in more detail, my knowledge of evolution is telling me that this isn't right. Homosexuality in humans is generally exclusive. How does exclusive homosexuality become an inherited trait subject to evolution if it is not passed on to a new generation? It may have evolved to a point (as non-exclusive homosexuality is visible in nature), but would have been instantly wiped out as soon as human intellect and emotion took over leading to exclusive homosexuality. I believe homosexuality is a hormonal inbalance, but certainly can't see it as an evolved trait.   ""How can something be going against nature if it can be found so prevalently in nature?""   Homosexuality in nature is not  exclusive,  so would provide no detremental effect to a species if homosexuality was practised only when no ""straight"" sex is possible. In this instance an evolved homosexual trait may exist, though I'm far more comfortable with the idea of hormonal inbalances as with humans.  I may be wrong though. As I say, this just seemed wrong on my current knowledge of evolution. I'll have to seek out some evidence either way before commiting to the ""hormonal inbalance"" view of homosexuality over an evolved trait.
",1
"The trait could be passed on if it only manifests in a small percent of the organisms carrying the trait. If there's a gene that randomly causes homosexuality in 10% of it's carriers, and it turns out that homosexuality is a benefit to the population as a whole, then evolution applies. Like the video says, looking at evolution on an individual scale is like looking at one pixel on your monitor. You have to look at the whole thing to get the full picture. An occasional hormonal imbalance leading to homosexuality could be seen as an evolved trait.
",1
"""If there's a gene that randomly causes homosexuality in 10% of it's carriers, and it turns out that homosexuality is a benefit to the population as a whole, then evolution applies.""   I believe the ""what's good for the group"" model of evolution has been firmly discredited, and is a common misunderstanding of evolutionary behaviour.  Firstly, let me address the concept of a gene. What constitues a gene is very subjective, so it is better for us to talk of ""units of evolution"" so we don't confuse ourselves with thinking about genes as a single entity that controls a single operation. Now, in order for homosexuality to be genetic rather than a simple hormone disbalance, we would have to show that there is a significant grouping of genes into a single homosexual unit of evolution, and that this unit of evolution strives to save itself through purely altruistic methods.  Now, the general idea of ""what is good for the group"" seems at first to be a possible intepretation of evolution in a larger scale. However, the correct interpretation is what is good for the unit of evolution. Altruistic behaviour appears to be of no benefit to an individual, but obviously the trait to do something altruistic would find it very hard to saturate a gene pool; therefore there is absolutely no benefit in saving another over you. If, however, we think purely at the level of the unit of evolution, then we see that apparently unhelpful behaviours (such as an animal informing other animals of an approaching predetor, whilst also making itself more visible to said predator) can saturate a gene pool if the gene is geared up for saving itself.  This means realistically that there are two ways for a unit to saturate the gene pool for a certain unit space; it benefits the individual carrying it, or it causes the individual to benefit other individuals who are most likely carrying the same unit of evolution. As homosexuality lends to a lack of saving ""itself"" (as it wont be passed on), it can only realistically become an evolved trait if it causes altruistic behavior that causes other carriers to be more likely to survive.  I know about evolution and I understand all these concepts. The point I'm making is that homosexuality doesn't appear to lend itself to any altruistic behaviour that would benefit people carrying the homosexual unit of evolution. Infact, recognition of other homosexual people in order to better select those to benefit would mean that the other person is also homosexual and therefore less likely to pass on their gene.   The main point being made is thus: Altruistic behaviour by a unit of evolution that hunders itself towards units of evolution that also actually hinder their own reproductive potential would be extremely unlikely to saturate the gene pool.

"That's not really accurate, no. Your body doesn't fight against the production of a male featus. Around the 7 to 12 weeks period, the male featus is exposed to testosterone, which aids in the development of male features and typical male brain development.

Therefore, calling homosexuality unnatural would be misleading (at the very least).  You are correct that we do not have the same genes as fish. But as I said earlier, homosexuality is prevalent in nature, and therefore must be genetic in all of the species I named (including many mammals, and some primates). Therefore if humans were not born homosexual, then this would make our species an exception.  None of this matters however, because we have studied humans, and homosexuality is  not  a choice.

"Gay marriage by itself probably doesn't. Gay marriage as it is being lobbied for takes away the First amendment rights of many americans. States which have passed these laws immediately begin teaching children that it is ""ok"" and even ""good"" to be gay. Some people just don't believe this, and they have that right! You have a right to believe the sky is purple and you have a right to teach that to your children! You have a right to teach your children that black people are evil and gays are going to hell. Are you a stupid bigot? YES! but you do have that right!  I have no problem with gay marriage, I do have a problem with the invasion of people's rights to believe that gay union is wrong. I also do not believe that marriage is a constitutional right, so gay marriage would have to be approved by a majority of voters in order to be obtained (and not in a courtroom!). If all of this happens, great! Just don't take away the rights of those who are religious to believe gay union is wrong.

"So let me get this straight. As long as a majority of people oppose someone else's right to something they themselves enjoy, that wronged person has to wait until the majority get with the program, and then and only then, does he get to enjoy what everyone else is enjoying? Huh?   The religious right can and do believe anything they want, no matter how stupid and obnoxious and irrational it is. They can and do teach their kids whatever nonsense they care to.  My right to equal protection under the law - my right to enjoy the same tax breaks, visitation rights, and property inheritance rights everyone else has - does not in any way interfere with that. How do you conceivably justify this denial of my rights under the same constitution and under the same tax code, with whatever minor challenge to someone's religious beliefs there could possibly be?  This is like denying rights to African Americans or Hispanics because the KKK has issues with it. That wouldn't stand for a second. Why am I any different?  No one is challenging any one's right to their beliefs here. But as a taxpaying American, I most certainly DO demand the same rights as you enjoy.  Let's be perfectly straight here: no one is asking a church to perform a same sex wedding. Most people who are gay wouldn't step foot in a church to begin with because there is so much hate there. As Ghandi said, ""I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. They are so much unlike him.""  There are plenty of Christian churches that love and accept us that no one would ever bother for one moment thinking about going into one of the palaces of hate that so many churches have become. So how in heaven's name does that interfere with your religion?  My own Episcopalian church couldn't possibly be a more warm and inviting place for gay and lesbian people. I love it there. It has allowed me to grow and thrive as a Christian. The old Baptist church I was raised in was a spiritual killing field. What kind of idiot would go back there for any reason?

"Two rebuttals here i'd like to offer:  1) research about homosexual couples being better parents or that homosexuality is genetic. I'm sorry, but neither of these things are proven facts, and there is a lot of controversial research on both sides of the aisle. I think both sides should be able to agree here that neither side has been proven. I know, I know, you can show me 100 studies that say the above is true, but guess what, I can show you 100 studies that say the opposite and then we just get into the ""who's study is better"" thing, and it's just a waste of time. Many things can be conclusively proven. These are not yet in that category for either side. Besides, for all the ""studies show"" comments above, no one has cited a single one. I find the funniest thing about such studies is that everyone has heard of them and is sure something has been shown conclusively, but no one is quite sure when or where.  2) the adoption thing is really irrelevant I think. In this country there aren't hordes of orphans wishing for parents to adopt them. This is a myth taken from the situation some time ago. Walk into an adoption clinic, things have really changed. It's not easy to adopt. Now outside of this country things are very different I know, but I still don't think gay marriage is going to significantly impact this. Feel free to disagree with me here, I just really think this is a seperate topic. Oh, and if you disagree, I think you will see that studies show I'm right ;)  (I'm kidding in case you didn't catch that) :)

"Yes, unfortunately that is democracy. The constitution gives us certain basic rights. If we want more we can pass laws to make more by majority vote or through our elected representatives. If those rights violate the constitutional ones, the courts can overturn them. If this happens the people can amend the constitution to pass the law anyway.  The constitution didn't give anyone the right to marry. People have passed laws allowing marriage between a man and a woman. These laws apply equally to all, so equal protection isn't violated (I'm sorry, you have just as much a right to marry a member of the opposite sex as anyone else). If you don't like it, you vote to change the laws.  That's democracy. It's not perfect, but it's the best thing out there!  Oh, and it's not the same as civil rights, and if I was black I would be horribly offended by such a comparison. They were fighting for basic human rights which had been denied them. They were being killed, and denied work opportunities and the right to vote. Homosexual's aren't being denied anything (that isn't already denied to everyone else in the country). They just aren't getting what they want.

Just because more heterosexual couples use protection to avoid pregnancy and therefore have a lower incidence rate of aids, does not mean it is a gay disease. Gay or straight sex is not the issue, it is whether or not you use condoms.

"Gay marriage hurts everyone.  The phrase ""gay marriage"" is an attack on language, and hurts everyone, as all people use language.

"Nice try at a cut and past job, but your argument does not hold water as the analogy between interracial marriage and homosexual unions does not carry over.  As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented. Indeed it is unprecedented everywhere in the history of the world. This is quite unlike interracial marriage which has been practiced in many times in many places throughout history, and in most cases without any special legal opinion on the matter. Homosexual unions are different and are new in their established recognition under law.  But that aside, i would point out that my original argument was addressing the issue of the curruption of language, and of the importance of preserving the long standing meaning of words, especially when there are no easy alternatives; such as in the case of the word ""marriage"". By attempting to broaden or slightly redefine the meaning of a word, you neccessarily dilute its original meaning.  If proponents of non-sex-specific unions had rallied for civil unions, or same sex unions recognition under the law, we would not be having this conversation.   What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority. This is form of calculated aggression against long standing traditional meaning of language, and should not be tolerated by a civil society.  In this Republican form of government, the minority should be protected from the majority, but the majority should also be protected from the minority. Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!  When language is eroded by degrees, then it ceases to have meaning; communication, and even thought itself become impossible. And society is brought unto a state of total decay and ruin. What once were men are then little more than animals. Read a page out of Orwell's 1984. The government's new speak is double ungood.

"""As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented.""   First result on google: ""The first country to allow same-sex couples to enter into legally recognized marriage was the Netherlands, effective in 2001. Since then, six other countries and seven U.S. states have followed suit, though voters in California revoked it through passage of Proposition 8."" I wouldn't call that unprecedented. If you are going to make a strong claim such as something has never been practiced, you should be sure you actually know what you are talking about. Therefore as I said using traditional marriage as an argument against same-sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage.  And your argument about language was really just wordy, vacuous, pseudo-intellectual babble. Words and language change over time. This is a natural phenomenon. Cultures are not stagnant. Marriage used to be between a man and the women he bought essentially. Society changes. This does not equate to a destruction of language.   ""What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority.""   You mean, just like interracial marriage?

""Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!""   Yes because the LGBT movement trying to gain civil rights is exactly like the Nazi regime.  I don't think you read 1984 very carefully if you think anything in it can be applied to being against same-sex marriage.  And I find no logical pathway for how same-sex marriage could lead to ""a state of total decay and ruin."" That's some class A fear mongering right there. Do you work for NOM?

"Addressing your first point, of course there are modern developements in calling legally recognized relationships between same sex couples ""marriage"", that is why it is worth debating, whereas as little as ten or twenty years ago it was not. I was speaking in the broad scope of human history, and in that great span, this misapplication of the more traditional term of ""marriage"" to some form of relationship between a couple who are of the same sex IS new and IS unprecedented, particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word ""marriage"" on everybody else against their consent in the name of equality and liberty for all.  I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither ""vacuous"" or ""pseoudo intellectual"". Some of the greatest intellectuals of Western Civilization are on my side on this one. Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used. And we have benefited greatly from them.  Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.  Any culture that values its heritage will naturally want to defend that culture from uncontrolled change including its own language, and it is natural and good that it should do this it is the practice of a form of social self preservation. This may sound academic, but it is not! It is exactly what is practiced by the government in French Canadia. They censor and conrol their printed media, street signs, and advertising billboards so as to assure adherence to the standard French language in word use and spelling. This may seem outlandish to the provintial mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.  I do not venture to put myself on the side of government cencorship of all printed media, but surely our American society if it values its own cultural heritage at all, must atleast protect its language within the confines of the written law.  If sufficient demand for civil unions passes the standard of civil debate and law, that is fine. But no equivelant forum exists for the passage of redefining the meaning of words. Unlike in French Canadia, there are no language police. As law is nothing but the accumulation of words, the manipulation and steady curruption of those words will lead to the destruction of those laws original meaning, either in word, or in practice as those ignorant of the past will be unable to understand the true meaning of the words as they were intended.  This is not hypothetical. The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.  As for interracial marriage, i have already addressed that issue, please read the previous post more carefully.  My 1984 reference was about the ministry of Truth, which systematically corrupted the language by deminishing the number of words and broadening each remaining words application, thereby diluting its meaning. The speaker posits this is exaclty what is occuring in the case of legal use of the term ""gay marriage"", for the reasons stated in the primary statement.  This speaker did not state ""that same-sex marriage could lead to 'a state of total decay and ruin.'"" The inner statement was taken out of context, see previous argument. Neither has this speaker sought to discredit same sex unions, either in principle or in law. The speaker wishes to make clear the distinction between using the word marriage in the traditional sense and in the new same-sex sense in which it is being applied. Proponents of the use of language of so called ""gay marriage"" would have you believe there is no difference between the two definitions, while simultaneously insisting that their new definition be accepted; which is a contradiction.

""Particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word ""marriage"" on everybody""   Just like forcing the new definition of the word marriage as being interracial as well. How can you not see that this is exactly the same thing?   ""I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither ""vacuous"" or ""pseoudo intellectual"".""   I never said words do not have meaning. And pondering meanings of words is not what I was criticizing you for. I was criticizing you for complaining that the natural progression of society and therefore its means of communication, language, amounts to a destruction of language.   ""Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used.""   No they were not all on your side. They never wrote anything about gay marriage or the changing of language of being its destruction. Wow you are really intellectually dishonest. They were authors who naturally were quite concerned with the meaning of the language they used to write their works, but that doesn't mean they were concerned with language changing. Please stop misrepresenting the truth.   ""Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.""   Here's a great example of your meaningless pseudo-intellectualism. ""Underlying reality"" is a meaningless phrase. Try to actually say something concrete next time. If you actually knew anything about language, you would understand what a joke it is to say that saying marriage is also between a man and a woman is a drastic change to language. Why don't you take a look at the archaic words and archaic definitions that are no longer used and then talk to me about drastic change. This change of the terms of marriage is incredibly slight. Yours is one of the worst arguments against gay marriage I have heard. At least Christians saying it goes against their holy book is factually correct, even though this is legally and philosophically incorrect. Merriam-Webster's definition of the word ""marriage"" includes same-sex marriage by the way.   ""This may sound academic, but it is not!""   At least you have one thing right.   ""This may seem outlandish to the  provintial  mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.""   I like when people deliberately use bigger words in a condescending way to sound smart and then spell them incorrectly. It tickles my irony bone.  And your argument if I can call it that about government censorship is lame. The fact that another government does something is not justification for it. I will spare you the holocaust analogies because I am still hoping you are intelligent enough to see now how stupid your point is.   ""The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.""   Oh my gosh you have uncovered the LGBT movement's secret plot. Their plan must have been to destroy civilization by destroying our language by making civil rights apply to them thereby changing the language. Blast those sexual deviants.

"Let's just say that 5 years ago when I married my husband, homosexual marriage was legal... this would have had absolutely  no  effect on my choice to get married to him! Why do you say that there would be less families? How do you define a family? People who care for each other? There are thousands of kids in orphanages all over the world who would be a billion times better off being raised by 2 homosexuals than left in the orphanage!

It a bit presumptuous of anyone to utter those words on subject matter they know so little about. Let me turn the tables though, for just one moment, when I say to you...HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT BEING GAY IS NOT A CHOICE!  I have known ""families"" with two moms and two dads. They were very loving families and the children felt that love very deeply...even when the questions came, as they always do. Most of the kids I kept track of wouldn't have traded their upbringing for one second because it taught them things about prejudice, acceptance, being different and being OK with that. They say they would not have had that same opportunity has they been raised by straight parents. All of them are fine and none of them are gay, no matter which gender they grew up with.
",1
"I was raised by straight parents, does that mean I havn't had an opportunity to be taught anything about prejudice, acceptance, or being different!?   oh and about ""How many times do I have to tell you"" im not sure that i have used that more than maybe once or twice but I am not fond of having to tell people the same things over and over again.

"That's one of your problems Jake...You tell people...you don't reason it out or even back it up with facts, statistics or anything else of value. You are completely homophobic Jake, face it. The possibility of this being a viable relationship is so foreign to you that you believe a child would be ruined by being a part of that relationship. Homosexuality is not a disease my friend...it's a way of life that was given those of us who are. No one should be punished because of it.
",1
"I'm not at all certain that is correct Jake. The estimate on the number of gays vs. straights in this country is about 10%. It may well be more, but the family structure has been maintained thus far in the world and will probably remain so. Yes, I would agree that any child needs a Mom or Dad to look up to and it is easier when there are one of each, however, I believe studies have shown very few, if any, bad affects have been realized from a two mom or two dad household. As long as there are members of the other sex around to give the child balance that's all that's really needed.

"I am a straight Christian and support gay marriage. Why? Simple. Separation of church and state.   Gay marriage opposition states that they want to preserve the sanctity of marriage. Let's look at the definition of sanctity: the quality or state of being holy or sacred.   That tells me: you cannot preserve the holiness of an act that is governed by the law. That is a violation of church and state.   If someone, a Christian or other religious person, wants to get married under the eyes of God in their church, then fine. But it is not our place to impede upon the rights of others that want to be married under the eyes of the law. Or even God, for that matter. I know many gay Christians. It is not our place to judge others or take away from them. Prop 8 is threatening to take away the rights of 18,000 ALREADY MARRIED couples. And all because our religious views clash with their lifestyles. This is not our battle.   I support gay marriage, and I support my gay married friends and will continue to fight with them for their equality.  Gay marriage does not hurt anyone except those of whom we are stripping away rights. There is no way to prove that gay marriage would impose upon our children in our schools. And besides, kids are going to learn about it anyway, right? Look at MTV right now. You think these kids don't know what's going on?
",1
"I applaud your ability to not impose your personal beliefs on others. If only more religious people could be like you.
",1
"I have noticed that many non-religious people impose their personal ""religious"" views on others. For example, I would like to see them support polygamy for consenting adults. Despite denying being religious, they want to impose their views on others by denying polygamists the right to marry.
",0
"This is a brilliant statement, and I have to agree with you on this.  I'm straight and currently have no defined religion (only one born of personal beliefs that has no name) but I don't see the problem with same sex marriage. For this, I use the same philosophy as in every part of my life: If what someone is doing doesn't hurt anyone else, they can keep doing it. Gay marriage isn't exactly killing anyone, people should put their effort into issues that actually matter instead of denying happy couples their right to be legally married.
",1
"Except there is no such thing as a ""separation of church and state,"" so your entire argument is moot. If there were this ""separation,"" then the federal government wouldn't be allowed to enforce their laws on churches, like telling churches they're not allowed to talk about politics. And yet the federal government DOES punish churches from talking about politics. Of course, the moment something religious enters into public territory, the federal government wastes no time in condemning it like the hypocrites that they are. My point, though, is that ""separation of church and state"" is nowhere in any of our founding documents. Nowhere. It is a myth. When the Constitution was ratified, many states had their own established religions and NONE of the Founders had any problem with this. They approved of established state religions! The First Amendment merely says that CONGRESS cannot establish any religion. Congress deals with federal laws, not state laws. So it is the federal government that cannot establish a nationwide religion. States, however, can. The Tenth Amendment says that anything NOT talked about elsewhere in the Constitution is up to the states. This means gay marriage, for one thing. Meaning that a federal BAN on gay marriage is unconstitutional; but so is a federal law ALLOWING gay marriage. Gay marriage is not in the Constitution, so it is up to each individual state to decide.  I do find it interesting, though, that you're a Christian and yet you support something that the founder of your religion did not support. Jesus'd be proud.
",0
"But what you are missing in my opinion, is that even if the constitution does not have a specific reference to separation of church and state, does that really make it OKAY to completely ignore that idea? If we just blindly followed everything the Constitution says, wouldn't we still have prohibition of alcohol, and wouldn't it be up to the states whether or not women and minorities not have the right to vote? Those were all changed in amendments. And I personally would support an amendment SPECIFYING a separation of church and state. What you talk about, people enforcing that churches do not talk about politics, I have never heard that before, but if it's true, the solution is not to say that because they can do that, you can ban gay marriage, the solution is to day that you should not be able to ban gay marriage and they can not enforce churches to not talk about politics. You're moving in the complete wrong direction, not in the right one. Without a separation of church and state, you get a government that influences its people or even forces its people to do things against their own religion.  I think you deeply do not understand the phrase ""separation of church and state"". It does not mean that one can not make references to politics or the state in church as you seem to imply, or even that one can not make references to the church in public funded buildings. What it means is that publicly funded things like schools, and any kind of government facility including courthouses, can not express support for, or utilize public prayers, or anything similar regarding religion, and yes that includes Atheism. A separation is not state-sponsored Atheism, as they are also not allowed to show support for a disbelief in God. A separation of church and state simply means that they can not coerce the people or force them into any kind of religion.  I think that your desire to ban gay marriage is what's really wrong and unconstitutional here. If a gay Christian wants to marry his partner, is it not a violation of the free exercise clause of the constitution to not allow him to do so, that is, if you really believe marriage is a religious institution? My main point as a Libertarian, is that marriage is simply voluntary human relations. As long as it's voluntary, you have no right to step in on people's personal lives and tell them how to live their own life.

"My concern of what is next is a plausible question. This is obviously an emotive topic for you, but you need to do your research, especially on the age of consent. Yes, the number of species observed with homosexual tendencies is vast, but does this makes it moral, ethical or ""completely harmless""? Who draws the line when it comes to patterning animal behaviour? Moralism and morality are opposites and thus there should be no confusion with each other. I am not homophobic but do have a phobia for lies being portrayed as truth, and I also have a plausible fear of the impact of these positions would have on your society. Heuristics as scepticism should not be a resting place for critical thinkers, hence considering the outcome (“what comes next”) of this revised moral position on your society should not be so offensive to you.

However, my solution falls short in that, although it gets homosexuals the rights they're after, it doesn't buy them acceptance. For example, it doesn't get them religious wedding ceremonies from some religions.  BTW, a little more about my personal life, if you're interested. When I was a child I loved to play with toy soldiers. I would spend hours setting them up. Once I asked my sister to play and she immediately started a battle. I said, ""What are you doing?"" She said, ""Well...., they're soldiers. They are doing what soldiers do."" I said, ""No! they're supposed to make treaties!"" She said, ""That's boring!"" and left. Later that night my grandmother said that it was time to go to bed and that I had to clear the soldiers off the bed. So I had a small skirmish so that I could go to bed and not have to put away those soldiers that were under the bed. In the morning I continued playing but I don't remember if the survivors had a funeral for those who died the night before or if they managed to resurrect them somehow.

Many Catholics have tried to do what the church says is right to do...some have failed and some have not, on some level. Look at it this way for a moment. You're straight...you were born that way. 90% of the rest of the world is gay because they were born that way. Could I or anyone convince you, or would you be happy if someone were to try and change you into being gay? I don't think that would be possible, do you?  It's also interesting to me that the churches have softened their views of this too. Not the Catholic church but others. Some even ordain gay people into the priesthood or the ministry. That tells me something has changed through the years. Could it be the medical findings of all those poor dead people who succumbed to AIDS that changed their minds? It certainly would mine or at the very least, re-think it. If people are born this way, how can they help what they were born to be?

"What evidence do you have to discredit people who have claimed to have become straight? There is a famous singing who publicly claimed that he was gay and is now straight, is he lying? Where is your evidence? It appears that you have a confirmation bias. I understand what you are attempting to say but, a world with a population of 90% gay cannot exist indefinitely (Sex for pleasure and not procreation, even a 90% heterosexual society would be in danger of becoming extinct).

"wow, repubgal, that sounded almost human ;)  I think that you hit the nail right on the head when you said homosexuality doesn't affect you personally. If more religious people took this approach then we would live in a world that had a lot less hate. I think Mark Twain put it best:   So much blood has been shed by the Church because of an omission from the Gospel: ""Ye shall be indifferent as to what your neighbor's religion is."" Not merely tolerant of it, but indifferent to it. Divinity is claimed for many religions; but no religion is great enough or divine enough to add that new law to its code.   - Mark Twain, a Biography

"Well, great.   I had never heard Mark Twain's quote. Put simply, that is exactly what America should aim for. We call ourselves the country of equal opportunity, and slowly we are becoming just that. To each his own.

"The definition of true freedom captures the essence of all contemporary debates. Whether we accept it or not, freedom has boundaries. Morality and ethic governs these boundaries. Thus, as knowledge increases, we venture beyond established limits. Understandably so, but as we enter the uncharted, morality and ethics must continue to govern us (they are the lamp to our feet). As a consequence this is where knowledge and wisdom diverge. Allowing Gays to marry is in my opinion the moral tipping point where all things deviant (which you love) would gain legitimacy. This is a knowledge driven venture only without understanding its ultimate impact on our society.

"Who's likely to be a better parent, statistically? Those who HAVE to adopt? Or those who can become pregnant by accident, and be forced to marry and raise a child they resent with a person they barely know?

"I don't have the stats on that but logically I should think it would lean toward the adoption...although in my own case I've heard the horror stories of my daughter growing up as an adoptee...it wasn't pretty.

"What do you mean by statistically? Are you saying there's statistical evidence?   Did you misconstrue my argument? I said if you're able to get pregnant by accident, you're more likely to raise a child you do not want. If you adopt, you're more likely to actually want the child.   How many adopted children do you know who resented being adopted? For me, zero. I think your whole argument is on very shaky ground.

"I actually know of a few, who maybe don't ""resent"" being adopted, but wished they had their actual parents, and blame a lot of their psychological problems on the fact that they weren't raised by their parents.    Only in THIS time, does this scenario hold so much value. When someone is born by an accident, and then is not wanted, and is raised poorly because of the fact. Why are adoption programs established in the first place? Because there are more people having sex that don't want children, there are more people without the means to have children, but want children, and there are more people out there suffering from bad parenting. This hasn't always been the case, see what I've said to Kukla.    The chances of ""accidentally"" having children, and the chances of not being able to care for the child, have to be higher now than any other time in history, partly due to the fact that there are just more people in general out there at this moment than any other specific time in history. If the failure rate is higher now than ever, and the number of gays raising children are higher than ever too, logically, the percent of failure has to effect the lower number, the gay adopters, more than the people having the children by accident. Also, something to conceder is, why are they failing? If it's because of the income, look at the percent of failure with a mother and father in the same income bracket than the adopter's, you will find that there is a wide gap.   Most accidental births, I'm sure, are well taken care of despite the fact that they weren't planned, more often in a higher income bracket than a lower. The people with a low income will fail, whereas the people in the higher one, even though it's accidental, will be taken care of just as well as ones raised by adopters, because they are given money, and already have the money to do so.   In all of time, there have been more straight couples with money and children than gay couples with money and children... think about it. Statistically speaking, the straight people may have failed more people over the coarse of history, but that doesn't mean that they haven't also raised more children successfully too.

"Unless I am misunderstanding you, how can an infant feel alienated if he/he is brought up by straight people? The child has no idea that one of the parents are gay!   In 1967, all adoptions and all information was sealed...forever!Even if it weren't there is nothing to say the mother was telling the truth about herself or the father of the child! No one checked these things.  And where, may I ask, you're getting your statistics from?

"Truly I do not see how it can hurt anyone at all. Studies are showing that some people are born gay and if you want to marry your lover who is anyone else to say that they should not be wed?  Is seeing 2 guys or gals with rings on their fingers really that obscene? What is the difference between seeing a married gay couple and a gay couple? Is there really that huge of a difference? I do not believe so.

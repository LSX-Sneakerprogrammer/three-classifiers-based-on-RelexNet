There is one logical reason to engage in intercourse. Procreation. Homosexuality cannot result in impregnation and thus there is no logical reason to engage in homosexual behavior.   Good. You elucidated your premise for your argument. Now for the bad news: your premise is arbitrary and of no more objective value to the universe than selecting pleasure, greed, or love.  You should skip the logical pretence and simply state that you think procreation is important, because you have no logic backing you.  Oh, and bonus: gay people will be able to procreate in a few decades, using technology that converts skin cells into gametes.

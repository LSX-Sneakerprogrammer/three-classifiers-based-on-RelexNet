Your "consenting adults" requirement doesn't hold water because that can be legally changed as well. In the old days the age of consent was much lower.  The point that I'm trying to make however is that the best definition of marriage is exactly what it currently is because it is very specific. The whole purpose of language is to add clarity, not to obfuscate the issue. If you want a word to mean the union of two human beings, then come up with one. Don't obfuscate the language.

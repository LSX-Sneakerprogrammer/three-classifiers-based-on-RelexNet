There are many practical reasons for not allowing same sex marriage. I forgot a few but one I can recall goes like this: studies show that children need a mother and a father for parental role models. It keeps the childâ€™s emotional health in check. Also the bible calls gay marriage unnatural and basically, wrong. If you are a Christian, you are a hypocrite if you support gay marriage.

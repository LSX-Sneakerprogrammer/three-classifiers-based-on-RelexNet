Children in many cases keep marriages together   Bullshit. Show me some statistics. If anything, I would say that having kids probably puts more strain on the marriage. I have plenty of friends that have divorced parents, so unless you can show me a study that proves your point, I am going to be inclined to believe you are wrong.  I agree that having two parents makes things easier on the children, but this isn't a reason why gays shouldn't get married. In fact, studies have shown that homosexual parents are equally as capable as heterosexual parents, therefore, if a gay couple were to adopt the child would turn out better then if they had no parents.

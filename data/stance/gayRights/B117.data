A) I love how it was religion that was women's outlets   Fair enough I think that it was deemed that here is where they could do the least damage. Given that there is nothing they could say or do.   B) Greeks are whites even though a lot of their philosophy was derived/similar to asian philosophy.   What has this got to do with anything?   C) Articles written by women obviously biasedly focusing on some inequalities. They never mention how men died in their millions so that women could live.   And articles written bt men are bias towards women.  Was it only for the sake of women that were wars fought for, not for land, freedom, religion, wealth, to protect everyone.   last I checked everyone was different and all people are too be treated as equals.   Glad to see you agree that homosexual people should be treated as equals.   Last I checked paedophiles (etc. etc.) were not treated as equals either. You want gay rights.. you best give all these sick fucks rights.   The treatment of paedophiles should have no bearing on this debate if you want to debate that I would advise setting up a debate on it. Giving rights to Gay people is not the same, paedophiles are sexual predators that destroy lives, Gay people are not and do not.   Call the gays civil partners then. Not married. Simples.   Why, because you say so, not going to happen, don't you live in England where the rights of same sex couples to get married are law, have fun trying to change that.   I don't have to believe in God or follow religion to have the same arguments I have.   No you do not, but it is you that brought religion into this debate.

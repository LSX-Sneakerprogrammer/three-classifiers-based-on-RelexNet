In order to oppose gay couples being able to adopt you have to prove beyond any doubt that it causes long term harm to the child. Otherwise there is really no grounds on which to stand against this.  In fact I know many Christians who believe homosexuality is wrong that don't oppose gay adoption. It actually provides an increase in the demand for adoptions, which lowers the number of abortions performed. Win-Win!

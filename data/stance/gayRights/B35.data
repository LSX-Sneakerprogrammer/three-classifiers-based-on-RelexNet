No, it's is not.   Logic is just a way of systematizing or formalizing thought. You're somewhat abusing the term when you keep asserting that something isn't logical because it disagrees with your concept of what is right and/or appropriate.   Your desire for sex is simply instinctual need to procreate.   Not entirely true. In primates and monkeys, and some cetacea, sex is also used for mere pleasure, increasing the closeness of bonds and attaining resources or favors (I mean prostitution).

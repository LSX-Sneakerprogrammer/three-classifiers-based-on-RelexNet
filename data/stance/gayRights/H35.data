What right do gay people have to force their views on everyone els?   Nobody is forcing you to get gay married!  Why can't you fucking understand this!  Two people you don't know getting married doesn't effect you at all!  Edit: Sorry, didn't realize how old this debate was...feel free to respond if your opinions are the same though.

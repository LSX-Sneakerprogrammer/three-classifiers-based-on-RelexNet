Yes, gay marriage should be allowed. Many people in my family are so against it because it goes against their religious and political principles, but I am not, and I just don't understand, why so many people have to have such a grudge against them being married. It's not like gay people are harming anyone by getting married, so what is the big deal? The government should allow gay marriage in every state, it seems to violate the freedom of choice, for gay people.

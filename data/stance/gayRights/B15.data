Homosexuality leads to diseases, as do other sexual perversions.   As does "straight" sex or any other type of sexual you deem to be normal. Condoms prevent the spread of disease. STDs are just as prevalent amongst heterosexuals. You believe laws should be grounded in logic? OK...it's not logical to arbitrarily deny rights that you confer upon others.

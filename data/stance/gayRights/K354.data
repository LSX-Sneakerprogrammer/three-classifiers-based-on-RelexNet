Gay marriage hurts everyone.  The phrase "gay marriage" is an attack on language, and hurts everyone, as all people use language.  The phrase "gay marriage" is itself an attack on the traditional meaning of the word "marriage". The lack of a clear and agreed definition of a word makes it impossible for people to have a reasonable debate on the subject pertaining to that word.  Indeed by confusing the meaning of the word "marriage", it makes it impossible for people to rationally discuss it.  A new word or phrase should be chosen so as not to do harm to the existing meaning of words, while at the same time recognizing the essential characteristics of what is to be described by the word or phrase.  The new practice of what may be called a "homosexual union" is new, because it carries with it recognition under the law, which is unprecedented. But separate from whatever legal definitions may be ascribed to it, the failure to adequately name the practice does harm to the established language and its meaning.  In particular, the practice of calling this "gay marriage" does harm both to the word "gay", and to the word "marriage", both of which have established meanings in language, and are widely used. Indeed the word "marriage" has no synonym which can be used in its place, unlike the word "gay" which can be replaced in usage by the word "happy"; So the destruction or redefinition of the word "marriage" is hurtful to the language in a way that can not be easily mended.  It is precisely the confusion over the definition of the words which has caused so much apparent disagreement which could have been avoided with adequate clarity and agreement over the definitions of the words which they are arguing over.  In conclusion, the phrase "gay marriage" hurts users of language by confusing the established meaning of words, making rational discussion impossible. The phrase "gay marriage" is describing something new in that it claims legal status. Therefore, one should pick another set of words that do not harm the established meaning of words in use. In particular, the word "marriage" has an established meaning, and cannot be easily replaced. The phrase should instead be "homosexual union" or some other phrase that recognizes the nature of the relationship, while at the same time not doing harm to the long established meaning of the word "marriage". Finally, by unequivocating the meaning of the words used, much unnecessary disagreement and wasted debate could be avoided.

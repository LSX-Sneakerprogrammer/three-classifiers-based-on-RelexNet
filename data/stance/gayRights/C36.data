California had a vote on Gay Marriage, and I believe all three votes came out to be against gay marriage. California, who would have thought? I think when it comes to gay marriage this has a major "Bradley Effect".   No, it wasn't the "Bradley Effect" it was the "Mormon Church Effect", which poured millions of dollars into mobilizing people to vote against it, and millions of dollars funding TV ads to oppose it. Follow the money and it leads back to Utah.

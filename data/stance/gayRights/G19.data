It's arbitrary because all I have to do is change the law to suite my preference. Which by the way is something that is actively being done with the age of consent.   Preference and the ability to consent aren't inclusive. That, for example, the age of consent might be lowered or raised has no bearing on the legal definition of consent.   The law used to say one thing and now that definition is being broadened to suite more peoples personal preferences   The law has only broadened which  consenting parties  can be married, the issue of express consent would still need to be addressed if your slippery slope is to be accepted.   If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference?   As long as there are two expressly consenting parties, then nothing should stop us from allowing other people to get married. An animal can't consent. And despite your efforts below to show that your cat can, it's  you  who's saying it's consenting, not the cat itself. You can't consent on behalf of another unless that  legal  entity legally acquiesces to your authority to do so.   Were it ends then becomes an arbitrary standard. And if you don't set one, the thing gets so stretched that it hardly resembles what it first look liked.   You're purposefully ignoring the issue of express consent to continue your argument, and it's simply becoming disingenuous at this point.

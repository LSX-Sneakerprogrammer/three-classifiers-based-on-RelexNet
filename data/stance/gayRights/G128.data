That's like saying buildings make bricks.   No, it's nothing like that. Actually, I see Avedomni over there has put it better than I can -- you're conflating description with definition.   Oh I see, you want to use the force of law to make me accept something I find unacceptable.   Accept it? No, I don't think you will ever accept it. Your mind is closed. But I do want to force you to  tolerate  it. We forced racial integration onto people who didn't want it, and that was a good thing. We should force gay marriage onto people for similar reasons.   early death (@45yrs of age) high rates of infectious diseases, depression and suicide is really a good thing   I wouldn't say it's a good thing. It just  is . Are you honestly suggesting a large number of people should repress their sexuality for their entire lives?   Problems such as depression and suicide are caused by a lack of tolerance, and we should work to change society's attitude. That's a separate issue though.  Also, American Physicians and Surgeons is a political organization. I'm sure you know that as well as I do. If you want to have an honest debate, cite neutral third parties.    I love those caught in the gay lifestyle and what to see them set free.   Can't be done. Homosexuality is not a choice.   http://www.apa.org/topics/ sorientation.html

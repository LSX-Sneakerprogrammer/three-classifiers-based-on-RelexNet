I don't have an information to back me up here, but I find this statement highly dubious.   Do you know what they say about the male intuition? Neither do I. Nor do I know who "they" constitutes. But people have been getting married since before there were states - as the definition and requirements have changed over time - and before there were religions. Marriage as we describe it now is a civil contract and not a religious one. I'm right, somehow, either way.

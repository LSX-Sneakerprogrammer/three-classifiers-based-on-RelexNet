In a sense, homosexuals are NOT WRONG because they stop the world from overpopulation.   Wow, this sentence just reduced an entire demographic of living, loving normal human beings to a single function outside of which they have no purpose.   it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers   Besides the apparent contradiction with the fist sentence already pointed out by ReventonRage, this shows a lack of open mindedness on your part in suffering from the same issue as the first statement albeit from the opposite perspective.   Therefore, i believe, MOST men and women must be attracted to each other to inorder to grow and advane as a human race.   This is quite insulting to homosexuals, look at your fist statement, you are contradicting yourself again.

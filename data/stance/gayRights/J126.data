What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature   Ignoring the fact that we actually do find many instances of homosexuality in the animal kingdom and thus nature....  You're violating the naturalistic fallacy. You assume that something which is natural is inherently "good" and something not natural is "bad".  If you can show me where in nature we find skyscrapers and microchips....that would be great! Because these things aren't exactly natural either. Yet something like cannibalism is actually pretty common in nature.

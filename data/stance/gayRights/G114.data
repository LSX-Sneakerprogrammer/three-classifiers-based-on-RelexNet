blatant attempts to bring religion into government   Hey got one;  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are  created  equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator  with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Looks like it's the other way around doesn't it? In America we ground laws and rights in the transcendent. If you don't like that, go get your own country or try China.  We say homosexuality is wrong because the Creator who gives us our rights says it's wrong. Not because of some silly conspiracy theory.

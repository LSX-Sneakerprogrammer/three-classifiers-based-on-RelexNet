You know, I find the human insufferable when they are not gracious enough in belief to use a sporting modicum of respect. You are referring to a Homosexual on the same levelings as a pedophile - you Sir are unimaginably deluded and pious. I also gather that you are religious from your Blithe protective fist at Christianity. Religion adopted by a mind that finds science (the truth) incomprehensible, a crutch for the feeble minded. I personally think ''rot in a dustbin'' is very shrewd - your use of metaphysical conceit sums you up in a neat, worthy package.

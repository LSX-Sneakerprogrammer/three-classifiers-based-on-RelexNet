of course who am i to judge people. its their choice and isnt effecting anyone else. i mean lets say when a girl was young a man did something bad to her and after that she was afraid to be with another guy. so what...shes never supposed to be happy again with someone because we think its not "normal" or whatever. i mean we are so used to what is natural we forget that the normal way of living isnt the only way of living.

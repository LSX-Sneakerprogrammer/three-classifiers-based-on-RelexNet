I don't think he was saying you were a Mormon as an insult, but I have some understanding of your religion and feel it is related to the question to ask you if you feel African Americans should be allowed to adopt?  2 NEPHI 5:21   ---------------------------------  And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.   And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.   And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.   And because of their cursing which was upon them they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey.   ---------------------------------

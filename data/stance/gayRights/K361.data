I have not "derided another's love as unworthy" as you claim.  My argument is not "nothing but a thinly veiled gay bashing." as you claim. I have used only logic and reason in my arguments. You're statement on the other hand is tantamount to calling me a gay basher; it is slander and it is libelous, it is personally hurtful and i would ask that you refrain from ad homonim attacks, and confine yourself to the more respected tools of argument.  If you believe that i am a "gay basher" then i say you have me confused with someone else.  In any event, i would ask that you not resort to personal attacks, especially when this is a forum for arguing for or against a particular question, and this does not necessarily reflect ones personal views but is an exercize in public debate methods, as I'm sure you are aware of.

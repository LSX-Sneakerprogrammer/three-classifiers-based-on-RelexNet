This is a topic far more complicated than gay marriage. I believe society is still trying to get along with gay marriage and gay pride as to throw gay adoption in the way. I am not against gays, but I do believe that adoption is a whole new level. Gay parents will of course condition the child even if they don't want to, not to mention the hard time the child will have in school and the moral dilemma when he sees that his classmates have moms and dads. I'm not saying this will never happen, I'm just stating that gay couples adopting is not something society can deal with right now, we must be logical when it comes to promoting such laws, a step like this one is too much too soon.

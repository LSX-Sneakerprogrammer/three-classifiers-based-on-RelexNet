Sure I can Pyggy because they're both sensible.  As a gay person, why would anyone marry someone of the opposite sex? That simply makes no sense at all.  Pyggy.I am a GAY WOMAN and have been all my life. My arguments are "in your face" and therefore disliked. I don't kowtow nor do I pull the PC act when this very touchy subject comes up. I've heard it all and seen it all and I get very tired and put-upon as a human being when this kind of stuff comes up. Why don't you all just go back to the way it was before some discoveries were made and try to have us lobotomized or declared mentally incompetent.  You might have included the reasons why MY argument may cause less support for the idea. Please do so!

Hold on.  1) Your arguments are fundamentally the same as the anti-miscegenation tripe of the past.  2) This isn't an argument about the merits of homosexuality and it's disingenuous of you to try to turn the discussion to that end. I'm not going to be sucked into your selfish and vile agenda.  3)  You  would deny a group of people their rights and privileges as granted by the United States Constitution because  you  have a problem with their behavior (as if they're doing things that the vast majority of the human population isn't already doing) and who they are. And in that regard you are no better than a common racist. Your bigotry cannot be concealed and I'll have no part of it.  So, let me stop before I get dragged down to your level.

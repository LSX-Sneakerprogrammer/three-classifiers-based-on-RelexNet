Good so you agree that illicit sex is condemned by hinduism which means homosexuality is condemned.  Glad we got that over with.   What I agree is that the scriptures are open to interpretation by anyone, just because a conventional wisdom points them in a certain way does not indicate their intent. What I was also stating is that they are written by men, in this respect they are flawed.   Oh no! I'm a bigot. I'm so ashamed and terrified. Faggot   That is up to you.   And IM the one in denial.   Maybe you are, maybe you are not, but the matter of the fact is that homosexuals are here to stay, it is your choice to be bothered by them, although I don't see why you would as they are only living out their lives as they wish which is everyone right.   Ohh you're being gay again....   So by pointing out your mistake in the use of a word, I am attracted to people of the same sex, if you are unsure of what a gay person is I would advise checking it out before entering a debate about it.   Homosexuality is immoral since time immemorial   Homosexuality was a part of many ancient civilizations such as, Greece, Rome, China, etc   Homosexuality is condemned by 99% of all religions   Probably true of most modern religions.   Homosexuals are trying to make hetreosexual things their's i.e. marriage.   Marriage between heterosexual couples is performed as both a religious and a legal ceremony, Gay couples do not get married in a religious ceremony so why would it bother you? Homosexuals are human the same as heterosexuals, should they not have the same rights?   Homosexuals are gay   If you mean happy then I'm glad for them and wonder why you are not.  If you mean they are homosexuals then there is nothing more to say other than Duuuhhhhh.   You're gay   If you mean happy, yes I am. If you mean homosexual then no I am not, why would you consider me a homosexual? unless your gaydar is going off.

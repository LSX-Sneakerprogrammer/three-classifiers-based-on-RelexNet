If we take away the lovely embellishments of language and your insults against me, you haven't really answered my argument at all, aside from your statement that homosexuality and pedophilia aren't on the same level.   Tell me, where in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does it gives homosexuals the right to marry? And if we allow homosexuals to marry because "love is love" what is to stop a pedophile claiming the same right?

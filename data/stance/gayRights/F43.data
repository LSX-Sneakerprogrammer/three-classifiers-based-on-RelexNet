No it is not.  The bible also says you should stone children who don't obey their parents to death. Are you supporting that thing too? bc according to you, if you don't support everything that the bible says, your apparently not a real christian.  Im a christian, no one has the right to tell me Im not.  I don't support gay marriage, I don't think its right. But I still think everyone has the right to think for themselves, and not let me or you make decissions for them.

Why am I a fool for thinking that?   Because you are calling an entire group of people immoral for no other reason then that they are attracted to people of the same sex.  Because you don't recognize that romantic love can exist outside of a heterosexual woman, and man.  Because you believe, without any actual basis, that homosexual parents are incapable of raising a child correctly.  Because when I ask you  why  these act are immoral, your only response is to quote a bible verse.  And most importantly you allow these baseless views to interfere with other American's pursuit of happiness by denying them rights.

Your first argument compares two things that are not related; this is a fallacy of faulty analogy. The ability to fabricate an aircraft does not evidence an ability to raise and love a child. The argument does not deductively evidence why any person, gay or not gay, can raise and love a child. Moreover, you have asserted that homosexuals are not able to conceive children. Therefore, we can deduce from your claim that homosexuals are biologically deprived of the necessary organs for the conception of a child. Lastly, the argument is ineffective in proving any thing syllogistically. And as for the remainder of your claims and rhetorical questions they don’t deserve refutation. The entirety of the argument fails to prove one thing that has been validly deduced by the author.    Your final statement,” The assumption that there is something existentially negative about being gay.”   A. It is a sentence fragment. The subject is identified but there is no predicate.   B. You affirmed there is something that is existentially negative about being gay; they cannot conceive children.   Your whole of your argument begins with irrationality and ends with irrationality.  I expect that your future reply will also be equally irrational.

"Jewish people get married.  Islamic people get married.  Hindus, Buddhists, even Atheists get married."    Of course other religions get married, my reasoning also applies for them. Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism also have the right to choose who they wish to marry, none of those religions allow homosexuality.     "The Churches are the only people who AREN'T involved in the marriage process. Marriage is a legal thing as well as a cultural one, and this repression actually and fiscally hurts people."    Gay people can get civil partnerships, why do they  have  to be allowed to marry as well. Why do they even need to get married in the first place? If they sin once they might as well sin again.

please, we all need people who can provide some witty comments. and yes, that was funny cause it kind of is true.  if we stayed serious all the time, it wouldn't be that fun to come here as often.  yes, i'll admit, 80% of the topics that Joe brings up is crap, but his replies are pretty funny and necessary.

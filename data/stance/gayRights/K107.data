That's ridiculous.  That guy who was engaged then "turned gay" was already gay. Society told him he  wasn't  gay, that's why it took so long to figure out. Okay, in that example, bi-sexual. But people do not "turn" gay because of outside influence, it's something internal, in the brain.   I think society tells way more people that they are gay than that they aren't.   Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay. Do you seriously think life is somehow better or easier if you're gay? Do you  not  think gay people get made fun of, discriminated against, and avoided all of the time  for  being gay? How on earth would you justify your opinion that somehow society  wants  you to be gay?   the gay movement has begun trying to steal the right to vote from me   Again, how so? The only right being denied in this case is homosexuals Constitutional right to the "pursuit of happiness." Not to mention visitation rights in hospitals, or any one of the thousands of rights denied gay couples.   called names, attacked, been told "no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage" as is said on this board, while we on the other side are about as polite as can be.   Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay? Yet you're sad because someone stated the opinion that "no intelligent straight man would oppose gay marriage." Then please, by all means, make an intelligent arguemnent for your side. It will be the first.   The only hatred I've seen has been coming from the homosexual community. If you don't believe me, take a look at what they've been doing to the Mormons.   The mormon and catholic churches, but especially the mormon churches, spent millions trying to deny a group of people a human right, now some gays are protesting this by not shopping at their stores. And you call this "hatred?" Really, you need to think about this a little harder, or move on to the next subject.

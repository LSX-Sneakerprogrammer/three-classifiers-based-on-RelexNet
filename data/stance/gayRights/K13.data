Okay, so the behavior of the minority is abnormal, abnormal is deviant, and deviant behavior often isn't  accepted  by the majority. This is what you've established, and I don't disagree with it. But nowhere have you done anything to show why the behavior of the minority is unethical and immoral simply because it is deviant. You haven't shown abnormal behavior to be unacceptable, just stated that it is frequently unaccepted - by people like you.  I suppose the once deviant notion that a woman's word was equal to that of a man's, the abnormal view that women should be allowed to vote and own property was just "a slide of hands" by the women's rights movement. And, of course, if we apply your logic evenly, this makes them immoral and unethical for perpetrating deviant behavior. Godforbid we see it as social progress, it was something new and different, how could it be?   Your slippery slope argument comes off more like paranoia. If you cant make the distinction between rape and homosexuality simply because they are both actions of the minority, you must live in a very frightening world.

it's not about whether the parents are gay or straight, it's about how they raise their children, with truth or with lies, open minds or fear. both straight and gay parents are capable of both, their sexuality is irrelevant.  during anyone's childhood others may laugh at them for random reasons. the child wouldn't mind having happy gay parents and getting laughed at by mindless kids as much as he/she might mind having a straight couple as parents if they gets divorced or have a drug addiction or are abusive.  if a gay child grows up with straight parents, they don't fit in either. he might think he is straight. the mindset would stay with him for a long time, also. and that would be just as wrong as what you claimed.  when teaching about reproduction gay parents would have to tell the child where babies come from and how they do so. being gay doesn't mean they will make up some story about how gay people can conceive. they could, but being gay doesn't mean they will. what about all the straight parents who tell their kids they come from cabbages?

In my own personal feeling i think they should be able do adopt. Why can they have the wonders and joys that other people get to experience that they want in their lives. Its just not right picture if you were in their situation and you wanted a child what would you do? I would go out and adopt a kid because sometime you need kids to make your life more exciting. Maybe they don't want to leave the earth without a memory of them so if they gays want to adopt feel free because you have my support.

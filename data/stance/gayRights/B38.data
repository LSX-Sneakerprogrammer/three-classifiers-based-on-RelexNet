Is this an emotional response or a logical response? Laws ought to be based on logic, and there is no logical reason to engage in homosexual behavior.     Laws aren't based on logic. They are based on political compromise and/or majority opinion.  Further, moral values are not logically derived. There is no objective frame of reference to set as an axiom to base objective, logical morality upon. Therefore your statement about homosexual behaviour being illogical is erroneous.

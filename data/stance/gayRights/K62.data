The Bible considers homosexuality to be morally incorrect, and thus a sin.  Leviticus 20:13: If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.  Romans 1:27: Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.  1 Corinthians 6:9: Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders

From my understanding, the Topic is Gay adoption and should the opportunity of adoption be extended to those in a homosexual relationship. Whether if be a man and a man or a women and a women as a couple having the opportunity to raise a child. Also, the topic makes mention of human interaction with the child, during the raising and nurturing, from a male and a female. Can the same be done with two of the same sex? I would argue that you cannot compare apples to oranges. That is why I was interested in the specific points of nurture and the ability to raise. Which you so eloquently wrote out and felt the need to go into an extreme situation. While I do understand what you are stating, that is why we have a legal system in place. This is to prevent what US society would not consider a suitable parent. What you fail to address is how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.   Please refer to the 1st page of this book:  source:  http://books.google.com/ books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=NcmXvBX-- agC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PR3&dq;=adoption+law&ot s;=bMKbElPtsd&sig;=EGnN46PrECgKj75qw1ul uX0GcnM#PPA1,M1    You will find that adoption is considered: the creation of a parent-child relationship by judicial order between two parties who usually are unrelated.

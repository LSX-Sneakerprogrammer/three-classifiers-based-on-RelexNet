This is EXACTLY where you are wrong.   No i am not wrong. lol. Here is my argument and it may differ with what i stated previously (don't forget my thinking changes)  In one sense, belief is knowledge if it is knowledge. If i hadn't have any clue about the earth's revolution around the sun and stated "i believe the earth revolved around the sun" and found out later is was knowledge, then belief is knowledge.   Belief is an opinon that may or may not be true. Knowledge is truth.    You're wrong. "Too many" with respect to what? Be specific.   Too many people to carry. Overpopulation means when population exceeds the normal amount.    Contrary to your warped belief, it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   Im not whining. Your question was irrevalent. Why? Because whether or not i answer you doesn't change the scenario.    First, that is not what you have said. Second, prove that it is "mostly female homosexuals"? Finally, so what if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter all three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   Yes, that is what is stated. I stated " If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that..." What do you mean to prove that it is mostly female homosexuals? Prove that how i stated that??? Because if not, that is another irrevelant question. So what if it is mostly female homosexuals...because i stated so. It is a scenario. I created it.   Questions cannot change the scenario. It is what it is.    Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   I had never implied that so your entire arguement about this fails.    Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   The term population doesn't really mean blooming in size. When i say population, i simply mean people. Take the people out the equation, do you have a society still? Without no eskimos, there is no society. And i didn't know that eskimos have a rich society and culture. Cool.     Yes, but not "conquer and grow".   "Grow" as in succeeding.   Not all societies conquer. I was wrong to imply all.    Which is contradictory to what you have said.   In some ways societies can grow with homosexuals. In some ways, they can't.    I did. Until you reply my criticisms, I will not honour you with a rebuttal.   You really didn't disprove my scenarios as proof that homosexuality helps societies and does not help societies.   In ways they do help, and in way they don't. Im not saying that homosexuals are completely helping socities or not completely helping societies.

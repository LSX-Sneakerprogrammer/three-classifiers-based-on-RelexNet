You would deny a group of people their rights and privileges as granted by the United States Constitution because you have a problem with their behavior    And what exactly are these "rights and privileges as granted by the United States Constitution" that are being denied?     And if caring whether our not someone destroys their life is a selfish and vile agenda that makes me a common racist and bigot. Then I'm guilty as charged and will wear that badge with honor because I care enough about my fellow man to warn him when he is in peril.   This isn't an argument about the merits of homosexuality   Ideas stand or fall based on their merits, at least they should. So if you think gay marriage is a good thing, please make your case and show me the merits of it. Because as it stands now when I weigh the issue the negatives far exceed the positives.   So here is my challenge to you; If you support gay marriage convince me that it is a good thing and should be embraced by all people.   Final thought; Insult is not an argument, it's the failure to provide one.

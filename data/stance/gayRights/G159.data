As you say, "Marriage is something in particular." Its a legal union requiring a license from a government office, not from a religious organization. That's why gay people are fighting for "equal rights", not "equal rites."   For the government to remain neutral on this issue, they need to stop denying gay people the same rights as others to marry. As it is, the federal government is anything but neutral. They deny over one thousand federal benefits to people legally married in several states who happen to be of the same sex.

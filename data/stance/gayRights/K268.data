Give them civil union OK.   My marriage to my wife is something special, I like to know that the definition of marriage means husband and wife which cannot be taken away. What then does marriage mean when I say I'm married if it's not a man and women? It does hurt someone it hurts the people who are married and believe that marriage is and always will be defined as a man and women.

so do people wake up one morning and deside, hey, im going to like people of  blank  gender!  no, they do not.   you start getting crushes and likeing people in pre-school, what could have already influenced them by then? they havent been exposed to sex or anything, they dont know what "gay" is, so how can they be influenced or choose?

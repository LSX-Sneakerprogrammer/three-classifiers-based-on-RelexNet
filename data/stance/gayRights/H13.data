In short, yes, gay marriage should be allowed. If marriage between a man and a woman is legal (as well as intermarriage) then why should it not be allowed between those of the same sex?   Those who argue that it shouldn't be allowed because marriage is of a particular religion that forbids anyone being gay then they should also agree that marriage should therefore have nothing to do with being a legal matter in which a couple gets benefits from getting married such as in the areas of medical, taxes, death, and more. If gay couples can't receive these rights, then no one else should. Everyone should therefore be reduced to what many gays have to due now and just have a ceremonoly marriage with no legal benefits.   Also those who are against it due to their religion need to realize that whether or not it is against their religion or not, that has nothing to do with it because ,last I checked, my country has the freedom of religion, meaning not everyone has to follow what one person believes. And in all honestly, a gay marriage will ,in the most, not affect the said person any more then it does now.   Another point people agrue is that gay marriage will lead to and allow what is not traditionally thought of as a family and to many, this is unacceptable. And to those people, I say that the traditional family of a mother and father has already become less popular then it was a even a few decades ago. In today's world, there are many forms of what is now considered a "family". There are those who are raised with only a single parent, those who are divorced, those who were born from a seregate and raised by a different couple, ect, are only a few examples. People need to realize that times change and that a major change is happening now whether they agree with it or not.  In the end, I believe gay marriage should be allowed with all the legal rights and benefits that a marriage between a man and a woman have and those who think otherwise are basicly just discriminating against what is different from themselves. Eventually gay marriage will be legallize just as intermarriage has been and future generations will look down upon those who are against gay marriage now as we look down upon those who disagreed with intermarriage. Simple as that.

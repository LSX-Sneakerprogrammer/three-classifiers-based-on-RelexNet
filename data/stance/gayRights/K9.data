The definition of true freedom captures the essence of all contemporary debates. Whether we accept it or not, freedom has boundaries. Morality and ethic governs these boundaries. Thus, as knowledge increases, we venture beyond established limits. Understandably so, but as we enter the uncharted, morality and ethics must continue to govern us (they are the lamp to our feet). As a consequence this is where knowledge and wisdom diverge. Allowing Gays to marry is in my opinion the moral tipping point where all things deviant (which you love) would gain legitimacy. This is a knowledge driven venture only without understanding its ultimate impact on our society.

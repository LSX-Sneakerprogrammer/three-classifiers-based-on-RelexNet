Hmmm...., so when the government gives away farm subsidies then they are actually discriminating against me and violating my civil rights because they don't subsidize me.   Maybe I should get people organized and try to get me some of that action. What is it that I need.... a piece of paper? How do I go about it? Oh yeah, make the connection to civil rights (even though it really isn't the same thing at all. All I will be going after is benefits, not equal protection under the law, but what the heck).   Let's see, what else? Oh yeah, claim that denying me farm subsidies makes me a "second-class citizen" who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, farmers. This is good stuff ;)  So, the question is not "should farm subsidies be legal in the United State of America?" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in a discriminatory way towards non farmers. Obviously, the answer is "No".  This is easy! Why didn't I think of this before? ;)  But you know, it might be easier to just go after the benefits and maybe try to force the government to stop using the word marriage. That way you'll only have the government to deal with, not the government AND the religious right.   The gay community is fighting two fronts. Make peace with the religious right, let them have "their" "marriage" word and go after the government. Not because letting the religious right have "their" "marriage" word is the right thing to do but because it will expedite the gay community's access to "marriage" benefits.

Stanford puts it better than I can:  The term “morality” can be used either   descriptively to refer to some codes of conduct put forward by a society or,   some other group, such as a religion, or   accepted by an individual for her own behavior or   normatively to refer to a code of conduct that, given specified conditions, would be put forward by all rational persons.

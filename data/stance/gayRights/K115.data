Wow, I was so done with your arguements. You completely ignore every point made by anyone. Then twist around words to fit in this weird idea you have that somehow gays are discriminating against  you  by wanting to get married. Then you start making up stories about your sister being "scared" of all the gays on her way to school...  At first I thought you were a sane, but misled person. Now I am really beginning to believe you are crazy.  There are no gays rioting the streats. No one's lives or daughters or sisters are in mortal danger.  You don't see how comments like that are even more hateful and destructive than just saying things like "I hate fags?" Because they really are.   Then you tried to compare gay people to pediphiles!  You don't see that gay marriage is between two consenting people?  You really need to write an apology for this entire arguement...

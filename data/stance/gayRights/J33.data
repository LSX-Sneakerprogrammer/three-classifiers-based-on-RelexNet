"Saying that this country allows oppression is a false accusation? You need to read over American history again. The slaughter of Native Americans, slavery, segregation, Japanese internment camps are all particularly relevant."   Thats  exactly  why I said  "going on right now" . Do you remember that? Or do you have selective reading?   As for the video, I see where you are coming from with the 'fear mongering'. But the thing is, everything in that video is true. If I don't want my kids being taught that homosexuality is normal or okay why should I have to worry about it?   I believe that it is wrong. In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country. Instead of fear mongering and saying that religion is bad because it will oppress you.

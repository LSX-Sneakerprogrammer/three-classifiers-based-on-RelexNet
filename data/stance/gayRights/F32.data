This has nothing to do about their actions. Listen, they will be confronted and dealt with in the end, not my problem. I do not want to control them from being together, I honestly don't care. However, they DO NOT get to claim the title of marriage and receive the benefits of marriage when there is no such a thing!  http://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/marriage   read it and weep!  It is not recognized by our constitution as a right. The end. And it won't get added. If a state wants to legalize it they can try.  Personally, I say don't legalize it nor make it illegal, that way it will not be legally recognized however a person can either deny or accept "ceremonially" performing a wedding for them.

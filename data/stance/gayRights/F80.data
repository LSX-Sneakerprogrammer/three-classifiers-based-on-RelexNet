"You might want to look more closely at what I said. Marriage was around before Judaism. In fact it is dated back as far as we have records. "    Evidence? Considering how marraige predates any recordable history I don't see how you can come to such a conclusion.    "All I am trying to say is that you are choosing passages to belief and passages to ignore. Since you cannot reasonably deny that, I would just hope that perhaps you'll start ignoring the bigotry and focusing on the love."    Those passages were written at a time when murder and exile were the only forms of harsh punishment, we are talking about people who live of the land and travel round in tents, how else are you going to deter them from sinning? Also, you must also take into account the Jesus taught us to help sinners peaceful, hence the fact that we don't go around slaughter gays and adulterers.

Laws aren't based on logic.   Hence the use of the word 'ought'.   They are based on political compromise and/or majority opinion.   A majority of emotional people.   Further, moral values are not logically derived.   I did not use a moral argument.   Therefore your statement about homosexual behaviour being illogical is erroneous.   I did not use a moral argument. I used an argument based on the purpose of intercourse.

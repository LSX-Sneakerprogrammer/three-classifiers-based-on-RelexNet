Prove that homosexuality is natural.  There is no logical reason to pain pictures - in a way, there is. It shows future generations what the world looks (or rather, looked) like, primarily before the advent of the camera.  Hedonism is not logical. Pleasure is illogical. Enjoyment is illogical.  How are 'human rights' pleasurable?

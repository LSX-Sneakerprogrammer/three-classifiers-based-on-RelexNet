I believe that the purpose in life is to grow and advance.   As do I. But it is not right for me to dictate my SUBJECTIVE beliefs onto others out of some perverted sense of duty. That is absurd.   However, in another sense, it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers.   Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with  each other .

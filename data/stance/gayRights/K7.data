Science prides itself on making observation and via extrapolation forming plausible conclusions. Crude as it may be, my conclusion of a world without morals does not seem so far-fetch when considering the exponential increase in challenges from contemporary moral reformer. What is the reason for this? People do not what to be viewed as immoral or unethical. I concern is what's next? Lowering the age of consent to 10yrs? Freedom to have relation with animals? Just based on observation of what moral and ethical standards are under attack, one can conclude eventually we (mankind) will be living in a world without morals.

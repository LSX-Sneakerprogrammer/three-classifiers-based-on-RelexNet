Okay, I know SEVERAL children of same-sex parents and they turn out wacko. I'm sorry, I can't support this scientifically, but anyone else at my school will verify this.   `  A child who grows up seeing same-sex marriage will learn that it is okay. He will even think that it is his decision, just as he may choose his shirt color.  `  Society won't benefit. America will become even more decadent. I'm sorry.

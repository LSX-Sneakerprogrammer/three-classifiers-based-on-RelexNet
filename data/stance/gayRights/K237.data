Are you serious? Are you trying to come out of some kind of closet right now?  Marriage means nothing. I am against marriage personally, I dont think ANYONE should get married. It is just a way for the government to control you. I do not want to have to ask a judge if I can break up with my gf.   I also believe that if someone chooses to do this, whether they are gay, straight, or wants to marry an extra-terrestrial (you do know that if aliens from another planet came here and looked simular to us, that you homo-phobes would not even blink at the prospect of them getting married to us as long as it was male to female?) then they have the CHOICE, that is what freedom is all about.

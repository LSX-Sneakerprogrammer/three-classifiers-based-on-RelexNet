Yes. Their sexual proclivities do not say much about their parenting skills. Indeed, there are plenty of cases where the gay or lesbian couples are better suited and prepared to raise the children than those who gave them up in the first place.  And to those who think that their "lifestyle" will cause kids to be especially targeted by bullies at school or have a distorted view of life, doesn't this already happen with the children of nerds, hippies, rednecks, etc.?

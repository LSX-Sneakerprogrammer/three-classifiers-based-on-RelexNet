OK, sorry about the misquote, It was not intentional.  I liked your cliff, razor blade thing. ;)  I stopped reading after the 3rd paragraph because that is not what I'm saying. I think that we are talking past each other.  Here's what I'm saying:  if a straight person said he wanted a kid who shares his same reality and perspective, that marriage is only between a man and a woman, then that person would be classified a bigot. And it's really a shame because the only thing that matters is the rights associated with marriage, not the word marriage. If the gay community took their rights and left the word, then there would be peace.  Check this debate out.   http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/                                        Are_deaf_people_bigots_against_hearing_ people    We should probably continue over there because this is getting way too crowded.

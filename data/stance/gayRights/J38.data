No I read that correctly. I knew you would go there. Thats why I was so specific.   And I'm betting you did want me to shut up or you wouldn't have made the request based on the assumption that I had no other arguments left.   So who taught you how to type?    "I was only challenging you to make an actually point."   That link said nothing about my church, you still have not explained exactly what my church did to oppress you. You just repeated yourself.  Some of those 'facts' where only opinions.   So prove that my church spread lies. [That means prove that they actually are lies.]

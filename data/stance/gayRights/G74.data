This is a legal issue, not a mathematical one.  Separate but equal is a legal doctrine in United States Constitutional law that justified systems of segregation.   So saying "separate but equal, is inherently unequal" is saying segregation is wrong. The phrase comes from the Supreme Cout decision Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). To quote:  "We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal" has no place". Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."   Any questions?

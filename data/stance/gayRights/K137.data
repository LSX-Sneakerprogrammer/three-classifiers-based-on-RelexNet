Gays  ARE  entitled to equal protection under the law.  Gays  ARE  entitled to have the same rights as heterosexual married couples.  Gays  ARE NOT  entitled to the word "marriage!"  If gays feel that they need the word in order to be accepted, then they are misguided because you can't legislate acceptance. Even if they get to use the word, they wont necessarily be accepted by those who believe they shouldn't be allowed the same rights as heterosexual married couples. If gays just want the same rights as heterosexual married couples, then they should just call it something else and stop this "war."

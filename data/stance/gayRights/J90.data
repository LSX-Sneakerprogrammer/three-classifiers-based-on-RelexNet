Even though this debate is huge, I feel compelled to write my own argument anyway.   Single parents are capable of successfully raising children, and their children do fine growing up with only one gender role model.   Plus, there are SO many children in need of good, loving homes. What difference does it make if the parents are homosexual or heterosexual?

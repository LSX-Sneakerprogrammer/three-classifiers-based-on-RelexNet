No offense taken, I rather enjoy a good debate. I see where I've been butting my head the whole time. I've been trying to comprehend/grasp the concept, logically, of the homosexual being inescapably self-centered. Please explain.   I understand the logic of your explanation on the topic of the negative conclusion.   Burden of proof:   I must understand your logic prior to being able to bring up this in a logical manner. Please forgive me for having you reiterate your main point but I must understand it.

All homosexuals, male or female, who would adopt a child, are acting in a manner that is contrary to the nature and consequences of homosexuality. For by reason of their supposed natural, sexual orientation, as they call it, their actions negate the possibility of becoming progenitors as a consequence. Moreover, the homosexual nature also axiomatically negates the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors as parents as well as negating the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors to place their well-being as secondary and a child’s primary. However, before they have attempted to adopt a child, all homosexuals have already, in life, demonstrated the predispositional consequences of their sexual orientation which evidence the fact that they cannot put the well-being of anyone before their own subjective well-being. For don’t all homosexuals act contrary to the heterosexuality of their parents from which, as a consequence, they were born into this world? Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? So it should be understood that any homosexual male or female who wants to adopt a child is both, acting contrary to his/her sexuality, and is attempting to make the well-being of a child secondary; for homosexuals who want to adopt a child are choosing to do so for themselves and never because a child wants to be raised by homosexual males or females.   In conclusion: if adoption is acceptable in a society, the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives and never the public or an institution. For neither the public nor any institution can be held accountable for sorry decisions that ill-affect a child; whereas a parent who gives up its’ child for adoption must live with the consequences of that decision and will therefore choose as wisely as is possible in a manner that agrees with the nature of the parent.  Homosexual males and females refuse to be parents. And therefore no rational person ought to give their child to a person who is incapable of acting against his or own nature.

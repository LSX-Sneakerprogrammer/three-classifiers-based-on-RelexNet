But then what happens if there is a family with a  mother  and a  father , but, say, they get divorced, or a parent dies, or something, and then there is only one parent? Is the child going to come out of childhood 'messed up,' or different, like you say would happen? There are plenty of examples of successful, well-rounded adults coming out of homes of all types, ones with only a father, many with only a mother, so I don't see the difference, in your example, if there is a single parent or two parents of the same gender.

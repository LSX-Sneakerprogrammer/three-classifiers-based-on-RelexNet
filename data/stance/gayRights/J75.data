Though I agree with your position, I feel like more questions need to be asked. For instance, how old are these studies? Are they still going on?  Though I am for gay adoption, I do not think the answer is so obvious. It is stirring so much debate because gay adoption is going against the previous traditional values of American society, and any shift from one set of morals to another is bound to bring up some questions.   So, yet again, I implore others who are against gay adoption to post and give their point-of-view. I would like to keep this debate as level as possible.

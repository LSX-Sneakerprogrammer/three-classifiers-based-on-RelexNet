You're somewhat abusing the term when you keep asserting that something isn't logical because it disagrees with your concept of what is right and/or appropriate.   I base my logic on Roddenberry's logic - or, rather Vulcanian logic.   in primates and some cetacea, sex is also used for mere pleasure, increasing the closeness of bonds and attaining resources or favors (I mean prostitution).   I read awhile back about a type of crab that engages in coitus for after a male defends a female.  P.S. I've always disliked the term 'sex'. Why is it that I am the only one who says 'coitus' in everyday conversation?

Give the people what they want.   Most Americans don't what gay marriage to be legal. We live in a democracy. Not an oligarchy. We are not ruled by the few. The few is just louder. Americans are not required to give a reason for their votes. They can vote however they want. Don't let those sore losers who call themselves patriots, who say they want peace, who cause chaos in the streets tell you what to believe. Don't give in to conformity.   I am now going to tell you why I don't want gay marriage in my country:  1. Family - anything that goes against a mother and a father being the only definition of a family is going against the constitution, what this country was founded on and nature. We are in every way created to be with the opposite sex.  2. Homosexuality is abnormal. Most people are not gay. The media trains people to think the opposite. People are laterally being brainwashed. That is never good.  3. It goes against my beliefs. And I have a right to those beliefs.

You said she should not accuse the country of oppression and I was pointing out that our country has a history of it. And as I said even though past oppression may have been worse, it does not take away from the oppression now. But you failed to respond to that point, typically.  No everything in that video is not true. Proposition 8 had nothing to do with schools or children. As I said in another recent post, under California law parents can remove their children from any health or family lesson. Proposition 8 did not even mention kids or adoption or education.   "In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country."   Once again you demonstrate your complete lack of understanding of the Constitution. If you had a true or false question, "Is America based on majority rules?", the answer would be false. The system is set up with majority rules and minority rights with the latter not being an afterthought. The founders specifically set it up that way to avoid the kind of oppression that they experienced in Great Britain. The majority does not have the legal right to oppress the minority. Morally I strongly disagree with you that the oppressed minority should just "get over it or move to another country." Should the slaves have just gotten over it? But of course morals are opinions so neither of us is right. Legally, however, you couldn't be more incorrect.

Man, when will people just understand that we are  humans first . Sexual orientation doesn't matter. It... It really doesn't.  Instead of asking yourself "Should gay couples adopt?" Ask yourself if ANY couples without any moral standards should adopt. Once again, sexual orientation does NOT bear on one's moral standing, those who think so are fools.

I am a biologist and my point of view is other. The focus isn't on the kid's growth but who this will affect the population. Ok, maybe this will take some time, but is happen know. Moreover, the global warm was like this a few years ago. What I am trying to say is, if the gays have kids their kids will become gays. If they become gays, they won't meet someone to reproduce. If they won't reproduce the population will become old. If the population become old every one will die. Ok, maybe this can be extremist but this is the path that we are taking. If they solve this problem, I guess there won't be a problem whit this, I mean it will be great 'cos there will be more girls for me and a three some will be always a good call.

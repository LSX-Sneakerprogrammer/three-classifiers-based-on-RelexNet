This depends on what you call marriage. If you're talking marriage in the religious sense, then no. No one should ever have the right to force a religious institution to allow something that they don't believe in. If you're talking about marriage in terms of like...a civil union, then go for it. Hell, you can even have a ceremony if you want. For now, I'll assume this is talking about marriage in a religious sense and I'll say no.

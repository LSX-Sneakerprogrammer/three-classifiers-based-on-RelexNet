Rousseau disagrees. Hobbes and Rousseau had this debate roughly 400 years ago. Rousseau's view prevailed. Rights flow from the natural right that everyone has a right to dictate their own destiny. Hence, they're not a human construct.   I, then, must agree with Hobbes.   Yes.   I bought Leviathon awhile ago. Now I wish to read it. Tell me, in what writing came the debate betwixt Rousseau and Hobbes?   Both. Overbearing monarchs infringed on human rights.    Greece and Rome did not fall due to homosexuality. The rights of homosexuals to get married promotes peace and order, because it will please them thereby preventing civil unrest. Granting them this right does not infringe on the rights of others and is not a threat to public safety.   Homosexuality leads to diseases, as do other sexual perversions.

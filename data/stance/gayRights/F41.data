Im coming from?  Im a christian who respects that others can believe something else than me.  And I believe in that humans have rights, and one of those rights are to decide wich religion they wanna believe, or if they don't wanna believe in anything at all.  When you accept someone elses religion, you also have to accept that the law can't be made by your religions laws.

The idea that human affairs of importance can be simply based on emotional subjective feelings is the rock on which it founders.Humanity has advanced according to the understanding he has of the laws which govern everything around us ,from the turning of the planets, the cells in our bodies, the plants on the earth.We have learned to understood and use the laws of flight, of engineering etc to bring about advancements in our society.Everything is underpinned by laws and although many people quote the bible they would be better to quote the laws of god as seen in science.When we seriously break these laws we descend.Most of us 'sin by breaking laws which allow us to live and exist and evolve in the universe .At this time the decisions we make will decide if we survive or not as a society into the future .There are narcissistic and sometomes deliberately malign people who hate that they cannot control these laws in a personal way  and they are determined to undermine that which they cannot control. Marriage or the recognition of the law of energy creativity inherent in the polar opposites of male female is neccessary as a force of good energy and must be encouraged .If we passed laws according to what people'felt'  and not what is creative and good we would be back in the cave .Since there is no benefit to society one has to ask why 'they' want to get married,perhaps to undermine what they 'hate'.After all if it is simply a social recognition a personal party etc is their free choice.   If we go this route with them socety will unwind and that is the main purpose[ concious in most cases].

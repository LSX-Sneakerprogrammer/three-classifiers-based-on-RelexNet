No it means that their morals can still be applied today.   Which ones are you referring to, the Greeks or the Romans?   Not many of these cultures did.    http://greek-history.suite101.com/ article.cfm/women_in_ancient_greece     http://www.buzzle.com/articles/ women-in-the-ancient-chinese- culture.html     Gay people shouldn't impose their way of life to normal people   Define a normal person, last I checked everyone was different and all people are too be treated as equals.   They can do what they want behind closed doors and maybe normal people can overlook   Is there homosexual people doing anything overtly sexual in front of you all the time? Why should they have to hide and you not?    But sitting their justifying their sinful acts is disgraceful and disgusting.   It is a pity you feel this way as I guess it is only going to become easier for Gay people to go about their lives as straight people do.   My last point on this farcical debate is that Homosexuals getting married in a civil ceremony and being viewed only legally should not enrage the religious. Religious people regard their marriage as a bond put together by their God as this is not the case of Homosexual marriage why would it matter, as they will be judged by whichever God the religious person is prescribing to, which should make them more comfortable with it as they should know that punishment will be served. I do not believe in any God or follow any religion therefore the comments I just made are purely an appeal to logic.

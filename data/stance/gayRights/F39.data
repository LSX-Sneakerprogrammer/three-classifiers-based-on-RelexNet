I believe so too Tim.  But I also believe, that every man and woman has their own right to chose what they want to believe. When you come with an argument based on the bible, you force them to believe the same you believe, in a way.  If christians have so much against gay marriage, then don't get married to the same sex as you, but why make others do it too? How a man wants to live, isn't it his choice? or hers? Or is it yours Tim?

"Gay people are currently free to do anything they want, so in terms of fairness, liberty and equality, gay people are not disadvantaged at all."   This is so obvious I can't believe I actually have to state it explicitly: A gay person would want to marry someone of their own sex, whereas a straight person would want to marry someone of the opposite sex. Therefore, in terms of ability to marry  who they want , gays do not have the same rights as straight people.  Yes, civil unions would be better than nothing. But history has shown the idea of "separate but equal" is infeasible.

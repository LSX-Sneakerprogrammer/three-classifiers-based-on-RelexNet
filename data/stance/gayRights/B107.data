In China the Confunacists said that the first duty is to raise a family and take care of them and overlooked homosexuality if it was discreet and private.  The Greeks said that those who penetrated were dominant and masculine and those who got penetrated (LOL!!!) were feminine and submissive.  I could go on forever.. but none of the cultures allowed gay marriage.    Not many had open gay relations   So homosexuality isn't immoral since time immemorial, glad to see you agree on that.  In ancient Greece the male form was considered the ideal of beauty and the ancient Romans were fond of rampant homosexuality. If there was no gay marriage then I don't see how it impacts now, do we still have gladiatorial events where people are killed for amusement, NO. Do we still have widespread slavery, NO. Do we still have a view of women as second class citizens, NO. (OK we still have these things in some more devoutly religious  and obviously morally advanced:)  countries.)  But because of some all too conservative people, the rights of two people to be happy are denied based on out-dated texts and bigoted moral judgments. The fact that in the western world that the only real opposition to things like gay marriage comes from the religious communities is telling of their archaic and flawed morality. Gay people can not help being the way they are, it is not a belief system, or a choice it is an ingrained hormonally shaped sexuality, and if you are not this way you should count yourself lucky. Imagine being brought into a world where the very nature of yourself is ridiculed on any given day, where want you feel drawn to without explanation or choice is being chastised by huge groups of people, people that do not want to listen to evidence or reason, they KNOW they are right and that is that, and they WILL make your life hell because they deem themselves superior and in the right. A gay couple can not get married in a religious ceremony, so if they are not put together in the eyes of whichever God it is then it should not matter to the religious if Gay people had a legal ceremony or not.    TBH they are generally in line with me. Good to know that   They are not in line with you mate, as I said before in ancient Greece and Rome homosexuality was rampant and anyway even if ancient civilizations are in line with you then that shows where your morals stand, outdated and archaic.

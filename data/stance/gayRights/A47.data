So why did you add "lol" in front of an already illogical comment?   Because your comment made me laugh. Ok. I guess i am treating it as a joke a little as i think about it. But not entirely.    I have never argued based on emotion. You're putting words in my mouth again.   Nope. I am not putting words in your mouth. You did state that emotion can't be used as a logical argument. It would be best for me to show you the argument that you stated those words, but that seems difficult. Why? I don't remember the argument and i forgot the debate. I may look it up.    In epistemology, there is no difference between the discovery of knowledge and the creation of knowledge.   Yeah i agree. There is no difference between the two in Physics either.    This is question begging. You are arguing in a circle.   Look. I can easily start a society with mostly female homosexuals. I can start one as a simple college experiment. That is all what im saying. And eventually, the society will fail.    It is not reasonable because you haven't given the evidence for assuming that a society is composed of or can compose of mostly female homosexuals.   Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals. I haven't read of any society that composed of mostly female homosexuals in history books. It is a thinking scenario. A "what if" scenario.   Like this one other debator, i am simply proposing variables.   And this about it, how can a society survive with mostly female homosexuals? No children is ever going to be produced. This is common sense. Yes, they can adopt children but im ignoring that. Why? Because my scenario starts from the very beginning with just a few men and mostly female homosexuals.    You are wrong. Something cannot be both "right" and "wrong" at the same time. That is a contradiction.   You have to look at what im saying in the view that im saying. There are many views to look at. If i killed a rapist, in one view the death is a good thing because the rapist isn't going to harm anyone anymore. In another view, i am wrong because this death goes against my morality. I can't prove morality but morality exists. And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   And im not saying that they are completely wrong and completely right. They "share" a side of wrong and a side of right. Everybody can be right and wrong at the same time. You have to look at it one view at a time.    Hey idiot, you did mean to disrespect me. And by the way, you are thick headed. And I mean that with the utmost disrespect to you.   No, i didn't mean to disrespect you. I called you thick headed because you still question to say that my words are irrelevant to the debate as if we haven't discussed about it. That makes you an idiot too, in this view. And still, you say that my words are irrelevant to the debate. I told you, that it is irrelevant because i simply wanted to continue this argument. So why still ask it? Either you are thick headed and/or you are and idiot.   So really, i didn't mean to disrespect you. Im simply stating the truth i perceive.  Edit.    I have never argued based on emotion   Then why did you "argued" that i treated your criticism as a joke because i laughed. I know your reason but you contradicted yourself.

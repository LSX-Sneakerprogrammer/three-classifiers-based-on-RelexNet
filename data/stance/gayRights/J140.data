First of all, calm down there, Bill...  I don't like it because I myself am not gay, and I don't approve of the gay lifestyle. But I do think they should be able to do that if they want. It's a weird little part of me, I know, but that's just how I feel. I don't like it.  I can't prove that there isn't anything wrong with it, but I can't prove it just as much as you can't. There is no way to prove it either way.

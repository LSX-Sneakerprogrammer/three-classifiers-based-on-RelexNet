1 & 2. You contradict yourself. You write off the meat is murder crowd as foolish, and then go on to say that "Eating steak isn't morally wrong, so that's not a very good example." Although I agree that eating steak isn't morally wrong, clearly there are some people who believe it is. Should these people have the right to stop you from eating steak? Should you have the right to stop homosexuals from doing what they do? The answer to both these questions is no.  3.  There are plenty of other good people who don't support gay marriage.   Just like there were plenty of other  good  people who were against womens suffrage or the civil rights movement or even slavery. Your point only shows that it;s socially acceptable to oppose rights for homosexuals, not that its right. The point of using the KKK was to try and show you an example of a group that is now infamous for its intolerance.   Who are you quoting? You choose to make crap up that idiots have probably said instead of giving an actual quote from a smart person that is against gay marriage.   It's like arguing with a two year old, I swear!  Listen Jake, the point I was trying make is that it is socially acceptable to discriminate against gays. The quotes I used weren't direct quotes, but were typical of things that males our age might say to each other. I even admitted to saying them myself. I was not trying to accuse you or any other gay marriage opponent of anything, merely to demonstrate what the culture is. Also do not think I am accusing you specifically of saying these things, because I do not know you. In fact it seems very likely that you use this language less then me, if at all.   It's so obvious what you are trying and failing to do.   Clearly not to you.  Once again I am not trying to paint a stereotype...I am telling you what  all  kids are age say. Not liberals, not conservatives, but males in there teens or early twenties. Do you deny this? Are there not people at your school who use these terms? Let's get off our high horse for two seconds here Jake.   If you read the bible instead of cherrypicking quotes out of the book out of context then we can talk. Or you could just watch the west wing.   Jake, how many times do I have to tell you? I was raised a Catholic! I go to church  every Sunday , and usually I even pay attention.   In fact I'm pretty sure I have a Bible in my room. Let me go get it....yep here it is (it even still has the bookmarks from my conformation class).   There is a lot of symbolism in the bible that you would not understand.   That's pretty presumptuous Jake. Also pretty hypocritical of someone accusing me of arrogance. But let's ignore this for now.  So Jake, I'm sitting here Bible in hand. Dazzle me with you intellectual superiority. Explain to me why you are right when you claim that homosexuality is a sin, yet those people who justified male superiority though the Bible, and kept women as second class citizens for the majority of human history were wrong. What is the symbolism of saying that a womans menstrual cycle makes here unclean, or that any man who touches her is unclean as well? (Leviticus 15:19-27)  Enlighten me.  Jake, explain to my why the story of genesis is not also symbolic, even though every scientific discovery of the last hundred years has proven it to be false when taken literally.   I believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman, anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred.   Finally a legitimate response. Now we can have an actual discussion.  Are you also for making divorce, premarital sex, adultery, and masturbation illegal as well? Do they not also help to defeat the sanctity of marriage and family?  How do you feel about those studies which that being raised by parents of the same sex has no ill effects on the child? Those same studies show that what tends to hurt children is only having one parent, or in the case of orphans no parents. Would you rather orphans had no parents then two parents of the same sex?  Here is my main question...if you do not deny that homosexuals are born gay, then why would God make them as he did. Why would God intentionally put them in a situation where, if they want to love someone romantically (as a husband loves a wife), they are sinning. What kind of a cruel God would do that?  Jake, clearly homosexuals want to have sex...almost everyone does. You also are of the opinion that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. Why then, would you want to stop homosexuals from making their love and actions more moral?   Is it cool to call yourself a sarcastic dick?   It's called a self effacing joke. Look it up. Your supposed to laugh not get offended (and you complain about PC people getting offended easily,   jeez )

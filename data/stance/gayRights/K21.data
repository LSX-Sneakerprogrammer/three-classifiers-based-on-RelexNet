Exactly! Keep straight marriage a private thing too! Either take it out of the church or take it out of our government. I don't want to see you hold your wifes hand, or even look at her. In fact, lets kinda dab a little into what Middle Eastern Countries are doing, huh? Put a sheet over her and if anyone asks, she's not your wife... she's just a thing. Gay marriage and everything that goes along with marriage can't be kept private because the Right-Wing is making such a big deal about it.

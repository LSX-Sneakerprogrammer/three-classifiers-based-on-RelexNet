There is no such thing as gay marriage just like there is no such thing as gay rights, everyone has the same rights no one has different rights than others. Marriage is defined as between a man and a woman, with one of the main purposes being to procreate and have children, once you take that ability away there is no way it can be a marriage. This does not include those who just can't have babies because of sperm count or medical reasons.

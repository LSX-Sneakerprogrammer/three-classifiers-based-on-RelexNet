I am a christian.  I have read the bible, also where it says: Man shall not be with another man, and woman shall not be with another woman.  This is my personal law, Im not gonna be with another woman, couse my belief says its wrong.  But not everyone has the same religion as me. I think everyone has the right to believe what they want, and marry whomever they want.

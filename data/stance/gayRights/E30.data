On the one hand, if a gay couple have feelings for each other, we can not forbid them to have a connection. It will look like discrimination. Some countries have recognized same-sex marriage and respect the rights of gays and lesbians. We should have the neutrality position to gay couples. We should not condemn them, because it makes them mentally ill. But on the other hand, brought up in gay couples can affect the mental development of children. The modern world is cruel and people might laugh at this child. The child must be mentally strong to overcome the possible insults.

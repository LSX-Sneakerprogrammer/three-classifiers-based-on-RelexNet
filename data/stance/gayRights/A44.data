So if i laugh to something that i think it is funny, im incapable to rational thought?    You are again putting words in my mouth. I said that "you treat criticism as a joke" and therefore, you are incapable of rational thought. If you can't even understand that and can't read, you are incapable of rational thought.   Didn't you say, according to your logic, that emotion cannot be used as a logical arguement?   And I have not exercised any emotion in my judgement of your rationality. Furthermore, I said that I didn't find it amusing. The lack of amusement is not an emotion.   I laugh because it is funny, not because it is irrational.   Here, you are confusing cause and effect.   No, it isn't a brute fact but it is a fact.   An unasserted claim.   Ok. I see that im a little wrong. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created.   Why are you always contradicting yourself within the same breath?   I apologize. I see now the difference between "normal" and "exceeds the carrying capacity of the area." I was wrong.   Yeah, thank fuck for that. And I needed to repeat what I said four times for it to penetrate your thick, concussed skull? What a douche bag.   My scenario wasn't pointless.   Yes, it was. You admitted it yourself.   That alone doesn't even make logical sense.   Your analogy doesn't, but my criticisms do.   And no, it is not stupidity, it is called ignorance.   Ignorance is not a reason for stupidity. Moreover, your ignorance is a result of your stupidity.   The scenario is what it is.   Yeah, and what it is is pointless and illogical.   Accept the scenario for what it is.   I don't accept lies, false accusations and irrationality.   And claiming why there is mostly homosexual females doesn't even make sense?    Yeah, "there is mostly homosexual females" is  YOUR  claim, not mine. So explain yourself.   You can attack me on my English anytime you want.   I certainly will.   However, attack me and still answer my question.   I am answering your questions. You haven't answered the debate question: Should homosexuals get married?   My mistake   Not your only mistake.   I meant that homosexuality can be beneficial AND not.   Which has no bearing on whether homosexuals should get married or not.

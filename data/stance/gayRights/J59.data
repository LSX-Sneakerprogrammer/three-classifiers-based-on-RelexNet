We shouldn't take kids away from parents unless of course it's abuse or something.  I belive this is correct, so we must disagree on whether having gay parents is abusive.  Gay people have consenting partners which is not the same as child molestation. Would comparing gay people to child molesters be considered a disgusting and immoral hyperbole to you? if so, should you be allowed to have kids?  PS - everyone is a sinner - including your parents and you.

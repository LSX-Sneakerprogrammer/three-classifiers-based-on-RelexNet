I definitely beg to differ. It doesn't "spoil" they're psyche, rather, it expands it. It opens their minds to a different way of life than other kids get; and come on, if they have two parents who love them, what differance does it make what sex they are? People need to begin to understand that everyone deserves equal rights, and these kids who have gay parents will grow up defending that right and making a differance in the world, where as a kid with heterosexual parents who may happen to be homophobic, will not grow up this way, and may even get it doctrinated in their minds that homosexuality is wrong... so really, what's worse? The kids who help our world evolve by sharing their experiences and common knowlodge having lived with gay parents, and grew up to succesful, or kids who grow up passing on the message that homosexuality is wrong? Homophobia needs to be a thing of the past.

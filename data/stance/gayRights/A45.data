You are again putting words in my mouth. I said that "you treat criticism as a joke" and therefore, you are incapable of rational thought. If you can't even understand that and can't read, you are incapable of rational thought.   No, i don't treat your criticism as a joke. I never did. And thus, you are judging me wrong. So let me say what i said differently: so you think i treat your criticisms as a joke because i laugh. Wasn't you that said that emotion can't be used as a logical argument? It was you. So you made an logical argument because of my emotion....   Why are you always contradicting yourself within the same breath?   How was "Ok. I see that im a little wron. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created." a contradiction?    Yeah, thank fuck for that. And I needed to repeat what I said four times for it to penetrate your thick, concussed skull? What a douche bag.   lol no thanks to you. I implied normal as the "carrying capacity." You didn't do anything because this was already knowledge in my head.    Yes, it was. You admitted it yourself.   A created scenario is only pointless if it can't happen. My scenario of a society with mostly female homosexuals can happen because i can easily create one. I can gather up more than a few homosexuals and a few non homosexuals, put them in a house, and make an experiment out of it. People can say that the scenario is pointless because it never has occured in society before. And i say bravo because that proves that homosexuality is wrong in that sense.   I never admitted that the scenario was pointless. I said your questions was pointless.    I don't accept lies, false accusations and irrationality.   How was my scenario a lie? How was my scenario false accusation? How was my scenario irrational? Oh, Thank you. You admitted that my scenario was irrational. Irrational is a term that means illogical or NOT REASONABLE. A society with mostly female homosexuals is not reasonable and thus, in that view, it naturally makes homosexuality wrong. You just admitted that that scenario do have a point in proving that homosexuality is wrong.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ------------------------------------   Homosexuals should get married. But we are on another indepth discussion if homosexuality is right and wrong. I told you this three or four times and you keep questioning homosexuals and marriage. I understand that this is the debate topic BUT i basically told you that im ignoring it. I told you, indirectly, that my first answer to this debate to Apollo, was miscontrued. But i insisted to carry on this disccussion because you are wrong about my claim that homosexuals can be wrong and right.   This proves that you are thick headed. And i don't mean to disrespect you.

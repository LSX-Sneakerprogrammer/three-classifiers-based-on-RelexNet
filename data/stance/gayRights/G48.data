Yes, gay marriage should be legal. Civil unions are not the same as marriage and despite what everyone tries to make you think, those unions don't give you the same rights and privelages. The only thing keeping them from marrying are some long dead morals from hundreds of years ago. You know, the same morals that kept women and blacks from having any power in this country as well.

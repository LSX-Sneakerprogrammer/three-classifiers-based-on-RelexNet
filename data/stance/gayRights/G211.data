Well think about it. The gay community has received tremendous opposition in the last few months and have had some pretty heavy set backs. And they still want to pursue the same old tactics. I don't bang my head against the wall. If something doesn't work, I try something else. That something else is to make peace with the religious right and focus on getting the government to stop using the word marriage on marriage licenses.

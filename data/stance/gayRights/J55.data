I was letting you know that you were acting like a chore. It was accurate.  I didn't call you a Mormon as if it were an insult. I was asking if that that was the 'insult' you were referring to.  You're the one who has made our disagreement more about you and me, than the actual facts. That's the only pointless part.  So do you have any more arguments, or are we done here?

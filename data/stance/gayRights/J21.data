Because you are calling an entire group of people immoral for no other reason then that they are attracted to people of the same sex.   People are not immoral, their actions may be, and those actions are immoral.    Because you don't recognize that romantic love can exist outside of a heterosexual woman, and man.   Attraction?, yes. Not romantic love.    Because you believe, without any actual basis, that homosexual parents are incapable of raising a child correctly.   That's not true, but a father and a mother is the  only  correct way to have a family.    The Family, A Proclamation To The World    Because when I ask you why these act are immoral, your only response is to quote a bible verse.   What's so bad about the Bible?    And most importantly you allow these baseless views to interfere with other American's pursuit of happiness by denying them rights.   What can I do that they can't do? Get married? Sure they can.   Don't call me a fool because we have different beliefs. That could not be a more arrogant thing to do.

"I can't prove to you that my religion is true, but I can tell you that I know that it is."   No, you don't "know" that Christianity is right, you have  faith  in Christianity.  Knowledge has a rational foundation.  Faith is unfounded and irrational.  The problem with faith is that when people of two different faiths conflict, how do we decide which one is right? If you have faith in Christianity and another person has faith in Islam, how do we decide who is right? We can't, because neither belief has a rational foundation.

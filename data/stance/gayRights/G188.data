Refusing to change this definition arbitrarily is not discrimination.   Yes, it is. There is no reason not to change the definition except to prevent gays from attaining equal civil rights.    A solution to the problem would be a whole other kind of legal union for gay couples to enter into.    Or we could just let gays get married. Why not?    As of now, marriage is a legal covenant designed to take into interest the future plans of a man and women and progeny.   These plans won't be in any danger if gays are also allowed to get married.   There are also plenty of men and women who never bring progeny into the equation so that's clearly not a prerequisite for marriage.

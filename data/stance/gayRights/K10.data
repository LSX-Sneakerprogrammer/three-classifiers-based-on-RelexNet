Why is it immoral or unethical for gays to marry?   And am i right in saying that in your mind legitimizing gay marriage is equivalent to legitimizing rape, child porn, and sex with animals?  And why do I love deviant sexual behavior? Perhaps we should define the term, because i know to many right wing Christians deviant sexual behavior means anything outside of missionary position for a few minutes before bed.

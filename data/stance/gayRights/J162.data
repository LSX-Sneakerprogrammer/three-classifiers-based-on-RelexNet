But you are operating under a simplistic view of evolution for your argument. You even seemed to show your ignorance of the difference between a mechanism for evolution(natural selection) and the theory of evolution itself. We're not entirely certain if or how natural selection works on humans. Being sentient beings seems to mess with the dynamic a bit.

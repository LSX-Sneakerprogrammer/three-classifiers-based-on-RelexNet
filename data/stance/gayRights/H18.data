I shall oppose you on this subject until the day I die Jake. Being Gay is a fact, albeit not in the majority of the people born. You're right, never give in to conformity and we're trying not to! You talk about the few being louder. They have to be just to get the ear of those who can put things right. Ever hear of the Boston Tea Party? Those people were in the minority but they were absolutely right. What came from that was the fundamental right to be represented while being taxed.  What is a family? In today's world it is many things. A mother and father with children, a mother and child, a father and child, a child who has been abandoned but has been rescued through adoption or foster care and the gay couple or person whose God given right to have children has been thwarted by people like you. It's not "We" who have been created to be with the opposite sex. It is "You" and many, many others like you but what if you weren't created that way? What if you were created to be exactly what you are? Straight, Gay, Asexual and whatever else there is?  Homosexuality is not abnormal simply because you say so. You put up a debate in the last couple of weeks about wanting to read a good book. Good! Go read one about Homosexuality and how right it really is. What once was considered a malady of the mind is now a malady of the homophobe because you dare not disturb your thinking. So what that most people aren't gay? That has about as much to do with anything as most people not being born on Pitcairn Island! No one is being brainwashed here but you...especially not "laterally."  It goes against your beliefs and you have a right to those to those beliefs. Yes you do...but I'll tell you what Jake. In the time you've been here I have never once seen you alter anything about YOUR beliefs. Your beliefs are as old as Methuselah and you do not wish to alter them one degree by reading, interacting with or trying to understand what Gay people are or represent. We are all things, just like straight people are.   You even have the gall to bring in the Constitution of the United States. Please back-up ALL your condemnations with proof...outside of your own thoughts.

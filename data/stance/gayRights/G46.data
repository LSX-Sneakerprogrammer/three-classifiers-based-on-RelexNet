I agree with this statement! It's true... we are adults and some of you may not want to see two men hold hands but honestly I think it gross to watch a man and a women suck face in public. I don't like watching public affection both gay and straight. So if any of you are just saying that gays have no right to be married only cause you're afraid to see them kiss... do what I do when I see a man and a women make out! Ignore it and go about business were grown adults and the only thing majority of adults have to say is "Oh My God two people kissing!" Grow up act your age and move on!

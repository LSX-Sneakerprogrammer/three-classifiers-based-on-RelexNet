The bible says a lot of crazy things, that's why most Christians don't read it.   Yeah, its sad.. or at least I think its sad. But its also good if you go to church, and the priest will explain to everyone, and they'll learn to understand it.   it causes them a lot of unnecessary distress.   I so agree on this.  I've seen CHRISTIAN parents kick they're children out of the house, becouse they don't live up to the parents christian standards. Some teenagers get pregnant, find out they're gay or something else, that don't 'fit in' the church.  And thats aweful. When christians do that, I wonder if there is any difference between islam and christianity after all. You know christians are going around and telling people how good and kind they are? And the next you know their children are on their own on the street.  Not only underage children. I know a lesbian, who's christian parents didn't want anything to do with her, when she told them who she really was. She was 20 back then, and she has never spoken to her parents since.

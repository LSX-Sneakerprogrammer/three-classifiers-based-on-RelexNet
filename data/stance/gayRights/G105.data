Society as a whole should accept gays. That would be best.   But if it refuses to, we should still legally allow gay marriage. Because law should be based on reason, not popular prejudices. There's just no logical reason to disallow it.   "By failing to expand the definition, we are NOT collectively deriding gay love as unworthy."   Haha, I like how you added the word "not" in there. I haven't heard such a devastating rebuttal since first grade.  If we give gay love a lower status than straight love, we are saying it is less worthy. How is that not obvious?  You should stick to make witty comments Joe, you're no good at this big people stuff. ;)

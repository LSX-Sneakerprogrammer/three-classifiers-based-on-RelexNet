Obama may have been right to do it, but Bush wasn't a really bad guy for not having done it. It can't go too far, but if a society wants to place a preference on heterosexuality, by giving less respect to homosexual relationships, it can do it. It might hurt gay people's feelings if they don't get the exact treatment as heterosexuals, but that is sort of the point. Gays can still live how the want, but they can't force the majority to like it, or accept them, and little laws that don't grant full equality are not fundamental humal liberty issues, we have to draw the line somewhere, and no one would want to legalize bestiality or polygamy, and so we all draw the lines slightly different locations, and it is not worth throwing a hissy fit over... Sure you might be right, but its not that big of a deal. You can't force other people's respect and approval, you already have Massachusetts. Just relax.

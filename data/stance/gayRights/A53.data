Ah, yes. ReventonRage did pointed out a contradiction. However, both of you and him is forgetting the point. The point is that in one perspective or sense, it is wrong to be a homosexual. And in another sense, it is right to be a homosexual. I gave the reason why.   The truth can be contradicting but it doesn't mean that it isn't the truth.  I believe another point that you two are forgetting that there is a right and a wrong to every side. Being a homosexual is naturally right and wrong. Being a non-homosexual (straight male and female) can be both right and wrong.   Wow, this sentence just reduced an entire demographic of living, loving normal human beings to a single function outside of which they have no purpose.   This is one sense in which being a homosexual is right. You must had implied that i implied that this is the only way that they are right. No. Another way to advance as humans is education. Homosexuals can become teacher, scientists, mathmaticians, etc. I didn't pointed it out because i wanted to provide a short but simple comment to Apollo.    This is quite insulting to homosexuals, look at your fist statement, you are contradicting yourself again.   I should been more clearer. In many senses, a non-homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race. A homosexual person can advance the human race and NOT advance the human race.   It is contradicting but this is still the truth.  Edit. Homosexuals are wrong because they stop the world from populating. Homosexuals are right because they stop overpopulation. Those are two contradicting but truthful statements. In a "sense" if one person can't produce an offspring, he or she is opposing the purpose of life in ONE WAY. In another ways, he or she can support it. Hence people can be both right and wrong. Not producing an offsprings opposes the purpose of life by not increasing your own race in numbers.   In another sense, they are right for not increasing the numbers of their own race. Contradicting but true. Why? Overpopulation is the answer. Overpopulation can decrease the advancement of growth because if we use all of earth's resources, life would be hard to sustain. Now im not educated in the dangers that overpopulation can propose. If they propose no danger or if the danger i presented is incorrect, then please correct me....if you want to, of course. :D

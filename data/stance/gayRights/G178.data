"don't call it marriage."  Well, marriage is actually a civil union. It is licensed by a civil authority and it is the union of two people. So lets stop calling anything "marriage", at least legally, and let consenting adults form a civil union with the person they love. And if they want, some of them might want to do that in their church or temple!

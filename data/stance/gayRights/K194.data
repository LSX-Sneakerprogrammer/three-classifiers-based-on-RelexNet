Gay marriage doesn't hurt anyone. You see straight people get married, sometimes more then once..marriage is for everyone. Gay/Lesbian just want at least one marriage but people are to uptight/all about themselves to let that kind of marriage happen...I'm sick and tired of people not accepting others...I have no spirt or whatever you want to call it for america...we're just going to get worse, and its sickening. Love me or hate me, I'm speaking my thoughts.

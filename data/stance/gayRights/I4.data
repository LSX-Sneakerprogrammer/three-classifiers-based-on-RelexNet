"The majority of gay relationships last shorter then 6 months.  Only 2.7% of gays have 1 partner throughout their whole life.  One study says they have 8 sexual partners per year."  One study says they have 8 sexual partners per year."  Why should these rights be granted?"  because it doesn't harm anyone, because this doesn't directly have anything to do with homosexuality. and also I highly doubt your sites for this are credible...  "The goverment has no reason to grant these benefits. The goverment wants procreative type unions."  if you want to live in a society that only lets us get to do stuff that benefits them, then why don't we go all the way, live, and sleep where they want, eat what, and when they want, to condition us to do what they want, since everything is about thier benefit.  "The goverment has no reason to grant these benefits. The goverment wants procreative type unions."  only being able to do it with who they want sounds awfully close to the image i'v painted above... what about peope that can't have kids? since we can't benefit off thier love, why should allow them to love?  "Now, there are many economic benefits the goverment gives marriage, so this indicates they do this for certain goals they wish to accomplish, their goal: procreative type unions with child rearing. (6) as homosexuals cannot do this they fail."  there are economic benefits yes, do you honestly believe that people only marry so that the government can pay them to have offspring? im sorry i would get married regardless if i was getting paid for it, and we shouldn't only be allowed to marry if it benefits them and not especially just because they are paying us to.  "A common argument, and one that will likely be stated, is that banning SSM is discrimination. Actually, as marriage is about procreative type relationships then it isn't discrimination based off of sexuality, but rather nature. (7, 8) and have a procreative type relationship."  defign nature? nature on an objective level is everything, and if we only do things in the name of nature than whats with all this technology, buildings, and artificial crap we humans have laying around? saying something is unnatural is as convincing as saying something is "bad". people don't know how trite the word "nature" really is, nature can be defigned as anything. therefore banning marriage for two people because YOU deem it unnatural is discrimination, and prejudice.  "As Homosexuals can never produce children and/or have a procreative type relationship, then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature."  you can argue that we have the capabilities of sex in order to reproduce. however I don't see how homosexuality is hurting nature, and even though they can't do what through sex what sex is naturally there for, they're desires and needs are still natural and therefore is natural for them to pursue it.  "Marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female + children. As marriage is a large part of this culture, banning SSM is popular to common marriage stereotypes. (7, 8)"  yes to an extent, that is the first thing we think of when we think of marriage because marriage is about love and since heterosexuality is the norm, then when we think about love we automatically associate it with men and women. marriage is in culture more seen as a loving commitment, therefore if two people love each other, then isn't them marrying just part of the culture?  "Further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right, as discrimination to a privilege is just."  how can you believe that two people loving each other is not a right but something we just let them do? we are not allowed to love whoever we want?  "As you must prove in the states eyes they deserve this ritual/legal "right" then my argument on rights is void, if you cannot prove in the states eyes they deserve this then you have lost."  I do agree. that right or wrong in society is vague therefore we need to have it legalized in order for it to be allowed but that is only because we can't simply say that "whatever doesn't harm anyone else is allowed and does harm others is not allowed." because what harms or doesn't harm is subjective, therefore we created the political system we have in order to try and sort out all of the issues and together decide what is harmful and what isn't. illegalizing the right to love someone is discriminatory due to the fact that they aren't harming anyone, our government is not perfect and if people say that homosexuality is a problem then it will be treated like one, but it is not.

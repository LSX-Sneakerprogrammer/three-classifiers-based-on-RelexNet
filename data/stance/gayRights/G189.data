The same argument can be used against interracial marriage, against people of great age gaps, the disabled and the abled, etc...   An arbitrary definition is the problem, the other legal union would be the same as marriage; it would just have another name. A non arbitrary definition would be that Marriage is a contract granting certain rights and privileges. That among these rights are the ability to see your spouse in the hospital, to live on a military base with them if they are in the military, etc.

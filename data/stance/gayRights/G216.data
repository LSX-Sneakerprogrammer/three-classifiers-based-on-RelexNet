We can't have the whole world likingh peas -- because we will soon run out. We need a minority of people to like zucchini.  Which reminds me. Someone needs to invent a zucchini detector, to stop people from smuggling it into my house. Why do all these people keep bringing me zucchini? Are they trying to turn me into a zucchini lover?

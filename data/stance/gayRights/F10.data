I probably should clarify. I'm here because it interests me to know what reasons people have. I support do support gay marriage. In England the debate has come down to whether or not a legally identical thing (Civil-partnerships) should be renamed marriage. In my mind, both sides are being pedantic over wording and I think it's pretty pointless. However, if it was a matter of race, I would support changing "black marriage" to just marriage, so that's the view I have to hold here as well.  They're not crazy, they're Christian. They have been taught forever to overthrow their own view of morality and reason, and instead accept what some guy in a big building up the road tells them. I think I can forgive them on the grounds of ignorance. I can't forgive the millions of straight men and women that couldn't be bothered to vote simply because the issue didn't directly affect them.

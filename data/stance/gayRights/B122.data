ahh so instead of coming with a intelligent rebuttal you just resort to name calling, well done. to name a few religions that don't condemn gays, Buddhists don't, some sects of Hinduism doesn't, Scientology doesn't, a lot of pagans don't, FSM doesn't, neither does tarvuism. you have to understand not everyone is as closed minded as you.

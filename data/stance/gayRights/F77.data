Nope, marriage is dated back further even than Judaism. You just adopted it and now seem to think it belongs to you.  That is common knowledge, but that doesn't make it true. Why not check for yourself? I don't know why but Christians I talk to never seem to want to actually check the bible. If you do look, notice how each banning of homosexuality is nearby something you certainly don't follow. For example, Leviticus bans homosexuality and wearing clothes made of multiple fabrics. Jesus does say that "dogs" don't get into heaven, but also includes anyone that's ever told a lie. This kind of thing occurs at every reference to homosexuality, believe me, I checked. Why is it you are happy to ignore all these details? Obviously because they are silly. But why then don't you view the homosexuality stuff as silly? Misleading representatives of the church I suspect that are trying to spread their own personal preferences, in the same way the bible was recently used to defend slavery.

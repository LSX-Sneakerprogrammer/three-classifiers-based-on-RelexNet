Then I pity you. Emotions are not illogical to those that have them, because they're the result of chemical reactions in the brain. Rights are natural. Your Hobbesian approach to rights quickly leads to chaos and warfare. Laws exist to promote peace and order. Human rights exist to promote peace and order, because as soon as natural human rights are denied people by your standards become "illogically unhappy" and then chaos ensues.

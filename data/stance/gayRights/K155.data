So by your definition everyone is a bigot, including yourself, because I can probably come up with a group of people that you don't want to be around.  However, a closer look at the definition of the bigot will clearly show that it is possible for a person to not want to be around a group of people for reasons other than intolerance of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her own. For example, I do not want to be around people that don't speak my language because I would rather be something else rather than trying to make myself be understood or trying to understand what they were saying. And if we are just supposed to be sitting there saying nothing, I would still rather be something else.  BTW, I think that it is convenient that:  "Being intolerant of bigotry cannot be called bigotry."

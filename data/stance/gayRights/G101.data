Cagted: "Homosexuality is an act of gay sex, not gay love. "  So, heterosexuality is an act of sex, not love, right?  Because sexual attraction is just an act. There are no emotions involved in attraction. Its just like robot sex. Everyone knows robots can't love! Don't get me started about same-sex robots.   "Men sexually attracted to other men and vice versa is a type of sexual disorientation."  Hmmm. "vice versa?" So what you are saying then is " "Men sexually attracted to other men and men sexually attracted to other men is a type of sexual disorientation." Yes, this is disorienting, when you say it that way.   But you are close to the truth, which is that men sexually attracted to other men is a type of sexual orientation.  And speaking of being disoriented, you argue that same sex attraction is not a choice, but "correcting that behavior" is a choice. You want to "treat the condition".   All such "treatments" to date have been found by reputable scientists as less than worthless -- they are actually harmful. So, until there is a "cure" that is not harmful, and until gay folk decide they want to think of themselves as defective and in need of being fixed, then we ought to just get out of the way and join all the other countries in the world that permit same-sex marriage.

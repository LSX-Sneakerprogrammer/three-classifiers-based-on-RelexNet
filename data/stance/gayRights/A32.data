In a sense, homosexuals are NOT WRONG because they stop the world from overpopulation. However, in another sense, it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers.   Wow. A contradictory statement within the same breath? What do you mean when you say "homosexuals are not wrong"?   I believe this is the purpose of life because it is programmed in our heads.    This is getting tiresome. Do I  really  have to repeat the whole idea about "belief" and "knowledge" again? Sigh. Belief is very different from knowledge. For example, as I am typing this, I can't say that I  "believe"  that I am in front of the computer because I  know  that I am in front of the computer. Knowledge is simply belief on the basis of strong/over-whelming evidence. To say that you "believe" in anything in a debate amounts to saying nothing at all!   We fear the tip of the blame touching our heart because we do not want to die. We go to school because we want to better ourselves. If i had a billion dollars, i don't want to spend the rest of my life playing on my Nintendo Wii. If i do that, i would feel like im wasting my own life. I believe i can say the same about you because i can sense it.   How are any of these analogies related to whether homosexuals should or should not get married?

Definitions of marriage  This is where it might hurt your head.  The dictionary isn't always right. The dictionary is written by a bunch of people that give the definition of words as they see it. You go to a different country and several words have different meanings. Go to a country with morals and you'll see that marriage is between man and wife and that it is a religious ceremony. However in this new day and age (i agree) it doesn't have to be purely religious. But irregardless it is between a man and wife.  You cannot have a man and man or woman and woman or transexual and transexual or brother and sister or brother and father or brother and mother or sister and father or sister and mother or sister and sister or brother and brother or paedophile and young person or dead body and necrophile or a dog and a bestiality person.  You see what I'm getting at?   What exactly is immoral and irreligious about Homosexuality?.   Lol you being serious?   Can I, thanks. I will reference you when I need to be a bigot.   Blah blah blah anybody that isn't accepting of all types of peoples is a bigot. Have fun advocating paedophilia.  I'm not going to bother claling you a sick fuck cause I think all of you guys know you are...  I need to come up with a new accurate word to describe you queers.

The most important thing for a child to have in his or her life is a stable home, especially one where they can see a loving relationship. Yes, they need role models from both men and women. They need role models from as many types of people they can. I am a lesbian and I plan on having children eventually but I'm not going to seclude them from men. I have my father, my cousins, friends, and uncles all of whom I consider decent people and I'll make sure they can see all the types of lives in the spectrum. No study has shown that children raised by gay parents have more problems with gender roles or sexuality than those raised by straight couples. The only negative impact I can see is a child getting picked on for it but a) that is not the parents' fault but the society's and b) kids will always find something to make fun of because they are kids. It's what happens and, to an extent, it builds strength when paired with love from others. Hopefully, by the time my kids are old enough to learn what discrimination is, they world will be a bit better. And last- there are so many nameless kids in the system, why would we oppose something that puts them in loving homes?

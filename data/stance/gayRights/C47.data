the FFC says Congress can prescribe the effect of one state's laws on another state   To say that we must disregard The Full Faith and Credit Clause in a particular instance, cannot be an effect of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  No Effect =/= Effect  The only thing the caveat "to prescribe the effect thereof" does is it allows congress to determine HOW a law is recognized by another state not WHETHER it is recognized.  The equal protection clause is not the only part of the constitution DOMA violates.

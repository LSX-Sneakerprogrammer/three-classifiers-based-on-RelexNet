Which obviously makes no sense as a statement at all since it is merely begging the question. And thus, whatever you say subsequently on this statement is fallacious.   lol it totally makes sense. Knowledge isn't something that pops up. It already exists in this earth. If what you believe is the actual truth, then your belief is truth. By definiton, belief and knowledge differs. By mental thinking alone, belief and knowledge is the same when belief is knowledge.    Wrong. It is an opinion that has not been proven to be true or false.   By definition alone, yes. By mental thinking, no. Think about it. Beliefs MAY be true or false.    Wrong. It doesn't matter that it exceeds "the normal amount". Population growth exceeds "the normal amount" but it doesn't mean that just because the population is growing, there is overpopulation. Population growth might lead to overpopulation, but it doesn't necessarily result in overpopulation immediately. Overpopulation occurs when the population grows and exceeds the carrying capacity of an area such that it results in a fall in standard of living. If you can't understand that, either you have the IQ of an amoeba or you're too arrogant to admit that you're wrong. I know that I am not wrong because as a Geography scholar, I have studied population geography for a whole year and know my definitions well.   No, i do understand that and i had implied that. I should had stated that but i didn't. But you hadn't stated it either before. You too stated that overpopulation means that the population exceeds the normal amount.    Which doesn't make it wrong. You still haven't shown why my criticisms of your argument as unjustified. Thus, your scenario is a false one.   No, it doesn't make it wrong. It makes it pointless.    Since you claimed that it is "mostly female homosexuals", then justify your claim. Simple as that. Can't you understand simple English, idiot?   I did justify your claim. The fact that you would even ask that in the argument that im responding proves that you are not reading my argument entirely.    I don't want to change the scenario, stupid. I am showing why it is wrong.   I know that you don't want to change the scenario. And you are not showing how it is wrong. That is illogical speaking because simply that doesn't make sense. I created a scenario of a society with mostly homosexual females. Simply trying to prove it is wrong doesn't even make logical sense.    Yeah, I get that, moron. I have shown that it is a FALSE ANALOGY and you haven't disputed me.   I haven't disputed you because you haven't disputed me. You didn't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial (in scenario 2) and not beneficial (in scenario 1).    Which is ontologically wrong.   I don't what you mean that it is ontologically wrong. In one sense, the population is the people. In another sense, the population is the number of people.    Which has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry or not. Thus, such a statement is not only a contradiction to what you have previously said, it is also a red herring.  Again, until your reply my criticisms, this debate is over.   Now you are being ignorant. My argument is soley about not marriage, but whether or not homosexuality is right and/or wrong. I told two or three times that i went into this discussion because i implied marriage as producing children and that is why i went into the purpose of life. The reason why i still went into this discussion is because you are still replying me.   I replied to your criticism. I remember asking you countless questions that you never answered. And you haven't disprove my scenarios.   A society with mostly homosexuals can be beneficial or not. It depends. If society wants to continue for centuries, homosexuals need to bear children. Im ignoring the fact that you can adopt children.   If society is fearing overpopulation, homosexuals is beneficials by controlling the overpopulation rate. They are not the only source to stop population. They are just one way.   Im appalled that you don't even get this. And its annoying.

That is just the issue... some times people will vote for some thing that is really not ethical. (As in the example you gave of slavery, and in this case, gay rights and marriage). Do we just wait for the country to "come around" and get used to the idea of gay marriage? Will this issue polarize our country like slavery did and lead to another civil war? So who makes the decision to over ride the voters? Who they elected to run California will not overturn the vote, so should it go to the supreme court?

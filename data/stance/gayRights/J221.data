"wow my life my life is already turning out better then yours"   What do you mean your life is turning out well? You live with your parents. You have no responsibilities, accomplishments, or qualifications for anything as you are 15. You are not even old enough to get a job, what are you talking about?  Ah I see you are related to JakeJ. I can't say I am surprised.

That's one of your problems Jake...You tell people...you don't reason it out or even back it up with facts, statistics or anything else of value. You are completely homophobic Jake, face it. The possibility of this being a viable relationship is so foreign to you that you believe a child would be ruined by being a part of that relationship. Homosexuality is not a disease my friend...it's a way of life that was given those of us who are. No one should be punished because of it.

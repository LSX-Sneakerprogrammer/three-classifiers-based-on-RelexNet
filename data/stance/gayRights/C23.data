Damn it Soccer, you know better than this:   This law had no other purpose then to stop homosexuals from adopting children.   Are you telling me that you are clairvoyant? I thought you didn't believe in that crap.  Doesn't that law also prevent heterosexual couples who are living together from adopting? What? There are no heterosexual couples living together who want to adopt? What was that? If there were, they would just get married and adopt? Do you realize that there are obstacles, other than being gay, that handicap a couple to the point where they decide not to get married? Not because they don't want to get married but because of the obstacles.

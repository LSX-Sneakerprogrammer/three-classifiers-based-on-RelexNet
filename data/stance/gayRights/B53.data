There is nothing wrong with two consenting adults having more rights to each other and legally incorporating each other into their families. Denying them this right is only done out of bigotry and fear.   Some don't like it because they think the divorce rate will go higher. How is that bad? Its main effect might be on children, which usually isn't that bad. Many of my friends do not have nuclear families, and they are perfectly healthy functioning members of society. Marriage should be like contracts between employers and employees: well defined and voluntary.   Some don't like it because of their (interpretation of their) religion. In short these people do not believe in the separation of church and state, and are nothing less then fear ridden, insecure little tyrants. I can go into the details of their psychology and position, but its not flattering at all. Laws should be backed by secular and logical reasoning with the goal of increasing the well being of society. Marriage improves "the lot in life" of many people, for some it doesn't but they find it worth the try. Allowing gay marriage means that more people will find marriage an improvement to their lives. Marriage, unless combined with other causes, doesn't cause any considerable physical, financial, etc harm to others. Its a benefit to society with out Loss to society. There is no reasonable reason to not allow it.

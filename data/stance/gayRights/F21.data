Saying gay people can't be married is like saying black people can't be married. It is completely bigoted.  You Christians are saying that gay marriage is not Christian because of the bible. Well, if you want to stick to biblical standards of marriage, then you have to stone women who cheat on their husbands. Also, you are allowed to take as many wives as you like. Oh and by the way, women, you are your husbands property according to the "Good Book".  So much for "a Christian tradition". I don't really understand why gays want to be part of Christianity anyway, it's like being a Jewish Nazi.

Hello K,  Simplified answer: Healthy human beings who choose to not propagate their own sons and daughters are doing such for selfish reasons.   For the record: I despise the state institution of adoption. Thou shalt not covetâ€¦  No man or woman can provide a reasonable justification for transgressing that commandment. The fact that there exists a supposed argument that would justify the act of coveting the sons and daughters of other humans is evidence to me of a people who are dead to the words of the commandments.  If you would care for a more specific explanation, I have no problem submitting additional information.

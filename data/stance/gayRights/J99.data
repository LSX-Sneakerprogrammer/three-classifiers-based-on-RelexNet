The argument is invalid. What is particularly true in one instance cannot be inferred as universally true in all instances.  Arguments that reason from that which is true in one example to a conclusion that is universal is fallacious.  Example: andsoccer has hair, andsoccer is a male; therefore, all males have hair.  Moreover, what is true today of your judgment may not be necessarily true in fact. Though your judgment may be valid today your judgment precludes your right to change your mind about something you are unaware of that would alter your judgment. Just because you have judged that a person is not gay today doesn't rule out the possibility that the judgment may change in the future.  One last statement, for you, it's obvious that all homosexuals were raised by heterosexuals. And by reason of such, nobody can validly argue that the parents sexual orientation predetermines the sexual orientation of their children. (your welcome)

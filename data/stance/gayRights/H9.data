YES! and this is coming from a straight white girl. love has no gender so why should marriage. if everyone else has equal rights so should the gay community. when all the civil rights acts were enacted it was to get people of different races equal rights, this is basically the same thing. sexual orientation doesn't change who a person is, all it is, is the preference of partners. people who oppose this are the people who are probably homophobic or aren't fully comfortable with their sexuality. America needs to step up and realize when we gave rights to women, and people of different races, we left out a very big and very important part of society: the homosexuals. Why cant the government step up and right the wrongs it has done?

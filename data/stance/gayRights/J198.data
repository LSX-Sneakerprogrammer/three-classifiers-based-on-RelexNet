For what reason? From what I understand, 'marriage' is a social construct. 'Marriage' has not held the same definition since its creation, and it is also different across cultures. In some cultures, men can have four wives. In other cultures, men can have a wife and a girlfriend. And look at this country: until only just recently (the past 50 years or so), it was completely acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. It was a "personal" issue, not domestic violence.   I suggest reading this article on how traditional marriage has changed over time:   http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/ 260456_marriage.html    What I'm trying to get at is: of course homosexual marriages are unnatural. ALL marriages are unnatural. They are constructs of society. And if the society sees it fit, it can change the rules.

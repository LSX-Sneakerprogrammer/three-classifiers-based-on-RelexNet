The author is extremely funny and makes several very good points within his criticisms of Card. If I had a dollar for every man, woman or child who used the word "God" or "Religion" in their homophobic outlook on gay people, I'd be a rich woman. I'd be super-rich if I had another dollar for those who think their children are unsafe around gay people and most especially those who teach!  One day, we will see history made again when the first state actually ratifies a Constitutional vote in their state concerning this issue. Out of one will come many and I think I'll live to see it.

Both. It's very hard to obtain legal rights without acceptance by society.   Well, you know my stance. Marriage is about both  a   and   b . Legal rights must be equal for gay couples if their unions are no different to straight couples unions.   The "upholding the sanctity of our dictionaries" argument is retarded beyond belief. I can't believe so many of you are picking it up. We're talking about marriage in the legal sense. The common meaning of the term is completely irrelevant in this debate   What dictionary? You're so paranoid you think everyone around you is homophobic or something? I promise you I didn't look at a dictionary when I wrote this. Scout's honor! The legal sense of marriage comes from the common sense of marriage. You don't just make laws out of thin air, you base it on society's common rituals and traditions and ways of carrying out business and conducts.  Homosexuality is totally ok.

Procreation is not the reason most people have sex most of the time, very rarely is it so. What is the logical reason when heterosexual couples use condoms?   Emotion and Logic are not distinct. Logic builds off of Emotion, our reasoning is basically preemptively applied Emotional evaluation. For example, as a young child we touch the red coils of a electric stove; we associate that experience with the emotional response and though our reasoning when we see something glowing we think that its likely hot by inductive generalization. With out emotion we would have nothing stopping us from touching the next red glowing thing we see and our hands would be very burnt. Emotionally, we don't like pain.   One of my oldest friends is gay; if he one day wants the legal rights granted by marriage; he should be able to have them even if the other consenting adult in the contract is male. Personally I wouldn't mind marriage being abolished, perhaps replaced with a contract that legally incorporates someone into your family, without the religious and sexual undertones of marriage. Marriage IS NOT a religious thing, its a legal thing; ifs its religious then government needs to stop recognizing marriage and view it as a private religious practice.

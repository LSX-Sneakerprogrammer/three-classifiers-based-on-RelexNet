I appeciate the support and must admit that I had been debating back and forth with hellno and initially thought your response was from him so I may have been harsher than I would have been otherwise. Sorry for that, but hopefully I can clear up the FFC thing with this post.   FFC basically says that one state must recognize the marriages of other states   this is where you are mistaken - the FFC says Congress can prescribe the effect of one state's laws on another state including saying that a law passed in one state has no effect on another state (DOMA).  The reason DOMA might be unconstitutional is not the FFC, it is the equal protection clause. Here is the CA ruling in the case on Prop 8 that Dubois and Olson are taking to the Supreme Court (the Plaintiff's case starts on page 5).   https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/ 09cv2292/files/09cv2292-ORDER.pdf

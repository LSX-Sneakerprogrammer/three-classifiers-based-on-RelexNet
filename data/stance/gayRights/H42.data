Most Americans don't what gay marriage to be legal.   With respect to same-sex marriage, it's become an issue of the tyranny of the majority. Surely even you can recognize that there have been a number of movements that overcame the opposition of the majority to become constitutionally bound.   Family - anything that goes against a mother and a father being the only definition of a family is going against the constitution, what this country was founded on and nature.   A large number of animals have homosexuals within their population. Nature has nothing to do with it. Miscegeny was also constitutionally outlawed in the majority of states, and it took a constitutional amendment to allow its practice to be legal. It's not surprising that conservatives have been using the same bloody arguments that you and people like you (oh yeah, conservatives) use with respect to homosexuals and homosexual marriage are nearly the exact same arguments people were using during the days of anti-miscegenation.    We are in every way created to be with the opposite sex.   Which has no bearing on policy. And if it does, it's unconstitutional.   Homosexuality is abnormal.   So is left handedness.   Most people are not gay.   Most people aren't crippled from birth, either, but it doesn't stop us from making legal provisions for their equitable treatment.   It goes against my beliefs.   Of course it does. So what?   And I have a right to those beliefs.   But no right to turn your personal beliefs into policy. That, my friend, is unconstitutional - certainly if it's religious. And if it's just because gays and lesbians, transexuals, and vestites, and bisexuals make you queezy, then you have no legal ground to stand on either.   As far as I'm concerned, it's just a matter of time. I wish we had another "Why We Can't Wait" to read so we can all see the absolutely obtuse, ridiculousness of opposing progressive marriage reform. These antiquated religious and social mores are getting rather silly.

I'm not very well-researched on the topic, so I'm sure someone else could answer this better than I can, but I do know that there are certain things that married couples can do more easily than non-married couples. Things like getting joint insurance and becoming next of kin and stuff like that. I mean, if marriage didn't actually help couples do anything new with each other, in a legal sense, then why would most of us get married anyway? Of course I pose this question in a legal sense.

She doesn't need a marriage license to live as a married couple. And since we are more tolerant than in the past, no one will threaten her with jail time.  As far as the 1300 federal benefits, I already addressed that issue in one of my earlier argument to you. Stop fighting the religious right and focus on getting the government to stop using the word marriage and apply the words civil union to all unions, hetero and homo. Done.

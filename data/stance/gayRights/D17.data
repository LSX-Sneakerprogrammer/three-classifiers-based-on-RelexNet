Marriage should be allowed regardless of the participants gender. The only things I can think of to disallow marriage are age and consent. Marriage is about the people getting married, strangers not approving in a marriage should not even be a factor to be considered. Also, a lot of people like to include religion in this argument. With so many different beliefs, I think it should be left out, but as a Christian, isn't it taught that God loves everyone? and that Jesus says not to judge? So, why shouldn't God approve, and who is one person to decide another person's orientation?

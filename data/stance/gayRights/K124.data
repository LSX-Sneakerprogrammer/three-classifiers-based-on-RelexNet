Ok, this debate has caught alot of attention, so i'm going to put my two cents in...Gay marriage mmmm, so I am going to say is for those of you who thinks it does, do diffrent color people marrying each other bug you or has the debate says hurt you? Should a Elephant marry a mouse? The only person that gay marriage can hurt is the ones in the marriage. Now, I'm not for it, but I'm not going to waste my time fretting over it. Well you can say I'm not against either. Who knows I might fall in love with a chick and marry her one day, it's the love I think that matters, and other people should mind thier own business!

It is contradicting. However, my argument still stands correct.   A contradictory statement cannot make a valid argument.   Before i go ahead, this is all opinionated and this is what i believe is the "truth."   No it isn't. There is a difference between belief and knowledge. I've repeated this on this site more than thrice already. Ask me if you don't know the difference.   The truth is contradicting.   No, it isn't.   homosexuals stops the world from overpopulation.   Do you even know what "overpopulation" means?   I believe that is this knowledge/truth because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument   You are making the same mistake here  again . You're misconstruing belief and knowledge. That shows me that you  don't  understand what I was saying.   because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument   I don't see how your analogies relate to homosexuality.   However, i believe one of the main reason to fight in war is to not let other people control us.    You're wrong. Hitler started WW2 to control others.

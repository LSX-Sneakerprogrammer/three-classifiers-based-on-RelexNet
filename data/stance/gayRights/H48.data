A small study showed that people who identified themselves as homophobic tended to get more aroused when shown images of homosexual intercourse and sexual activity. They're scared out of their wits about being found out. That's why you have these sexually repressed base-republicans hiding in the closet while going to public restrooms to fancy a shag out of some other guy.  That episode with the politician months back actually made me remember "Queer London" (A book). A tremendously dense, but ridiculously eye-opening read.

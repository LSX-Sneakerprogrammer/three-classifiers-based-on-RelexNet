What evidence do you have to discredit people who have claimed to have become straight? There is a famous singing who publicly claimed that he was gay and is now straight, is he lying? Where is your evidence? It appears that you have a confirmation bias. I understand what you are attempting to say but, a world with a population of 90% gay cannot exist indefinitely (Sex for pleasure and not procreation, even a 90% heterosexual society would be in danger of becoming extinct).

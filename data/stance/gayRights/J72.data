This is actually a very prevalent issue. Gay adoption is still a widely debated subject. There are a few organizations trying to dismantle gay adoption (Here is an article from 2006...I'm sorry it's a bit old, but I feel like it still has weight to it:  http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/ 2006-02-20-gay-adoption_x.htm)  )  Also, you stated: "...I'm not saying they should adopt, but that they can, and it doesn't make much of a difference." Explain your reasoning. Why wouldn't it make much of a difference? Personally I am pro-adoption, but I feel that hearing out details would be more beneficial than stating simple claims.

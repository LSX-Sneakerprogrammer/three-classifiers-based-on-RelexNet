In a perfect world what you propose should work but unfortunately it is not a perfect a world and so we have two options.  1. Continue fighting over whether or not they can or cannot use the word. This can last indefinitely like the abortion issue.  2. Pick another word, grab the benefits/rights, stop the fighting and move on with all of our lives.  I'm 100% for option 2. I want to move on with my life ;)

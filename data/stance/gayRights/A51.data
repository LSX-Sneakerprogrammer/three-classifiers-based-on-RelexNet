No, this doesn't prove the scenario wrong.   Why does it have to be only female homosexuals? I stated that it is mostly female homosexuals. The scenario is filled with mostly homosexuals because well:   1. That is my scenario and i created it.   2. It is going to prove WHY homosexuality is right.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------   By legal definition, there is a small gap between society and population. However, i am putting them in the same category because the gap is small. According to google definition, the term society means the aggregate of people living together in a small or less ordered community. If people wasn't in a society, hence society will not exist because  1. People create society.   2. The term people is in the definition of society.   You stated: "According to the OED, "society" refers to the 'Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship.'" Without man, this association or society won't even exist. If man died, who is going to continue this association or companionship? Nobody would. Hence, no population means no society.   You stated: "Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesivness and tolerance..." First, that is a contradiction. You stated that a society is the association with one's fellow men. So how can it grow independently without man?   I am going give you a task. Build a house and don't allow no family to move in. Nobody is to ever live in that house after it is built. Is that house going to somehow, out of the blue, create family rules or laws? People create society. Society doesn't create itself.   You stated: "It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow." I agree that i can't say all societies have that desire. However, you see many times in history books the desire to be free, to work, to live, etc. Im not a historian with all the history classes i took, there were many times when mankind "didn't want to stop." They want to continue and grow through science, and technology. So i don't think it is a hasty generalisation. And when i stated "conquer" i didn't just mean violence. I also meant growth through science, technology, etc. That was my fault for not being specific.    And therefore, since both of your premises are not true   You haven't proven that it is not true.

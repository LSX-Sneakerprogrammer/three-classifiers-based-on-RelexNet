The separation of church and state is not evident at all in the idea that gay marriage should be illegal. People who are religious are trying to inflict their beliefs that gays are automatically sinners just because they happen to like their same sex onto everyone else, including children. We fought a deadly civil war in order to make it so our children won't grow up to be prejudiced against people who don't look the same as us. Should we really discriminate against people who are the same as us but just like their same gender romantically?

Let me just say, gay patnerships should be allowed but not gay marrige,my farther was gay but he hid the fact and walked out on us to pursue his gay lifestyle when i was 4.A marrige is to all intents to allow to people of the oppiste sex to procreate gays can simply not do this, nor should they be allowed to have children as my experienceof life showed me how much i missed in not having a farther so why deny that right to a child to fullfill your own selfish wantspeople can bleat all they want if you are gay fine ilve together but do not force churches to marry you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,we are so fragile

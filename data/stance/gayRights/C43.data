Not only does it generally just mean that a state will recognize the acts of another state not enforce the other state's laws within its borders.   Nowhere have I said that it does any such thing, nor would it have to. A state cannot say that a marriage never took place, if it occurred legally within another state. They do not have to make Gay marriage legal, simply that they must recognize marriages which have legally already occurred in other states. This is all that the clause requires.   It also says specifically that Congress can determine the effect thereof   Not when the 'effect' amounts to overturning the clause itself, then it would not be an effect by definition.    If my state says I can't buy alcohol on Sunday and I drive across the border does the other state have to not sell me alcohol?   {sigh}  No. This is not how the clause works. The clause does not require that one state must adopt the laws of another. Say for example, that I bought fireworks legally in one state and brought them into another state where they are illegal to purchase. The new state cannot take them away from me or prosecute me for having purchased them.

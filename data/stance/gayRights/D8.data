Marriage is more of a social and cultural thing now than religious so the Bible is holding less and less weight in the argument. If homosexuals love one another as heterosexuals do, they shoould be able to celebrate their love for one another in a meaningful way.   Just because it isn't the norm, and it doesn't bode well for the human race does not mean it is wrong and homosexuals shouldn't be allowed to marry. In fact it is because it isn't the norm that it's ok. Just because gay marriage is allwoed doesn't mean everyone is going to become gay and children will cease to enter the world.  And if the Bible does say these things then surely gay marriage is acceptable, they're the ones who'll be punished not you so why do you care?

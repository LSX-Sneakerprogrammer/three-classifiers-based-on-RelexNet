First of all Gay Marriage doesn't hurt anyone, and it even helps the economy. second is that the bible says allot of things that don't make sense, for people to have come from Adam and Eve Cain and Able would have had to had sex with Eve. Third the same would have had to happened with Noah. I'm saying if it's ok to have sex with your mother in the bible it must be ok for a man and a man or a woman and a woman to have sex.

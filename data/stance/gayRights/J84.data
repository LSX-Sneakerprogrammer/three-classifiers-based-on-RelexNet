I don't think that having two mothers or two fathers can screw a child up. By this, I mean that I don't think he will become a serial killer or schizophrenic or anything based solely on the fact that his parents are of the same sex. I have heard that there have been tests on this sort of thing, and gay couples children have turned out to be just about 'normal.' Perhaps, if the child is female, and her parents are both male, she will turn out to be more masculine than the average girl, but what is wrong with that? I also believe that if her two parents are both very feminine, she will turn out to be 'normal.' So, it is not so much the gender of the parents, but their personalities that mold the child. In this country, many hetero parents with children get divorces, or one of the parents dies, and it is then legal for only the mother/father to raise the child on their own. So, if having either no mother/father figure screws up a child, shouldn't raising a child on your own be illegal for as long as gay adoption is?  Also, don't most, or at least some, adopted babies come from third world countries where they will end up living their lives in poverty, violence, and probably no parents if they are not adopted? I don't understand why anyone would want to see a child raised this way instead of with two men who will love and care for them. It makes me sick.

"I have not "derided another's love as unworthy" as you claim."   Yes you have, all who campaign against gay marriage are essentially making that statement.   "this does not necessarily reflect ones personal views but is an exercize in public debate methods"   Well if you're just playing Devil's advocate, then I apologize for calling you a gay-basher.  But consider the effects of your words: Neocon sheep are liable to skim through your argument, nodding their heads without understanding, thinking that there is some kind of rational justification for their hateful beliefs. We can't have that.  Oh, and you seem to have overlooked the last paragraph in my previous argument. No ad-hominem there.

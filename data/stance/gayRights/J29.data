Yea, you just called me arrogant  also  without an argument as to why.  Yep, pretty fickle alright. (;  That said,   Falsely accusing the country for its wrong doings(just to prove appoint) is the most ungrateful and unpatriotic thing you can do.   That like everything els I said is pretty obvious and I don't plan on adding a reason because it's so obvious.

Love is not an acceptable answer because that opens the flood gates to everything else. Would you exclude a brother or sister who wanted to get married? What if a man wants more than 1 wife or a woman wants more than 1 husband? If the answer is no then why? You're rejecting them their right to marry. Homosexuals can't be the only exception.

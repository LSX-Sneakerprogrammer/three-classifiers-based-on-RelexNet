Jake said:   It hurts families, the more gay marriage the less families there will be, children need a mother and a father to look up to.   Good job voting that idiotic statement down everyone. I don't think the source of that idea has been explored enough though. And personally, I believe in humilating idiotic statements as a form of social punishment, so here goes. Hopefully you read this Jake.  gay marriage = less families only if you believe that people would  choose  to be gay instead of heterosexual.  that is, you jake, think that someone who is otherwise attracted to the opposite sex, would have had kids and raised them, will now move in with someone of the same sex and not have kids.  ignoring for a moment that this isn't all together bad since there are too many people. what kind of person would think that may be the case?  I know for myself, being very comfortable in my heterosexuality, I would not magically  turn  gay because a law was passed.   do you fear, jake, that you may magically  turn  gay if a law were passed?  because that is really the only reason for your statement. if you actually think about what your wrote, I mean, that's the only possible end conclusion.  and if you do stand behind that statement jake, I have to ask myself, what kind of person would have such a ridiculous fear.  and I can only think of one kind jake. a closet gay person.  so if you want to come out, which I'm assuming from your statement deep down you do, then this is the place for it. There seems to be a lot of open people here, and at least one very popular openly gay member.  it's okay jake, be brave.  and if you do choose to not come out, that's okay, I understand it's a cold hard world out there for a gay person. but know this at least.   whatever you do, whatever you say, no matter how much you deny it, I at least will always know that, you jake, are gay. and I accept that.

You, sir, have created a causal fallacy! Congratulations!  "It used to be that love devloped and grew within the context of a lifelong commitment. We have just reversed the order. And we wonder why over 50% of marriages end in divorce. Before we remove a fence we ought to ask why it was there in the first place."  I don't even know how it's possible to make the knowingly make the claim that marriages by love create divorces. It also implies that only those marriages that weren't arranged would lead to divorce. Is that what you're trying to argue? Are you making the argument that marriages should be arranged in order to mutually benefit matriarchs and patriarchs? The only reason why marriages that were arranged tended to stay together was because the women weren't allowed to protest legally. They were second class citizens. Additionally, people were much more religious in times past and the Bible warned against divorce. How could one hope to go against the Bible?  "If love is the criteria for marriage what do you do with all the arranged marriages that occurred throughout history, are they not marriages by your definition."  Well, if morality is the criteria for goodness, what do you do with the crusades that were blessed by the pope (who's infallible, so be careful about contradicting him ;) )?

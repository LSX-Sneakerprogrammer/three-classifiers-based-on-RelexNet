No statement contained within any of my arguments asserts that homosexuals are biologically incapable of sexual reproduction; the terms of my arguments were carefully chosen so as to not exclude the ability of homosexuals to sexually reproduce. Yet, in order for them to sexually reproduce and propagate their genetics through a progeny they must act contrary to their nature and have unprotected sex with the opposite gender, and probably more than once.    Now, since they actually are biologically capable of becoming progenitors we must therefore conclude they are not willing to do what is necessary to become parents. They choose to do that which will never produce offspring and are suffering the consequences of their choices; moreover, if they don’t like the consequences of their choices they ought to change their minds.   Conclusion: Individuals of the homosexual orientation can become progenitors. Yet, they choose to not do what must be done in order to become progenitors.    And finally, no man or woman has the right to become a parent. Parenthood is not a right; parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction. And no man or woman can justly claim authority over the progeny of another progenitor without the progenitor’s conference of authority over its progeny.

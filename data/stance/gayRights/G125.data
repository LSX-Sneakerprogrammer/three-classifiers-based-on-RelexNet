Ok then, the difference is there's no good reason for expanding the definition of orange juice to include lemonade, but there are several good reasons for expanding the definition of marriage to include gay marriage -- reasons like fairness, liberty, and equality.  I don't see how expanding the definition of marriage is confusing at all. You can just tell your kids, "Legally it's a contract between two people, but if you ask me, it's a union between a man and a woman done for the purpose of raising children." Do you seriously think they would have trouble grasping that?

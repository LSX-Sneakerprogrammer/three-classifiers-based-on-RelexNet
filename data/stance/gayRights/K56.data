Except there is no such thing as a "separation of church and state," so your entire argument is moot. If there were this "separation," then the federal government wouldn't be allowed to enforce their laws on churches, like telling churches they're not allowed to talk about politics. And yet the federal government DOES punish churches from talking about politics. Of course, the moment something religious enters into public territory, the federal government wastes no time in condemning it like the hypocrites that they are. My point, though, is that "separation of church and state" is nowhere in any of our founding documents. Nowhere. It is a myth. When the Constitution was ratified, many states had their own established religions and NONE of the Founders had any problem with this. They approved of established state religions! The First Amendment merely says that CONGRESS cannot establish any religion. Congress deals with federal laws, not state laws. So it is the federal government that cannot establish a nationwide religion. States, however, can. The Tenth Amendment says that anything NOT talked about elsewhere in the Constitution is up to the states. This means gay marriage, for one thing. Meaning that a federal BAN on gay marriage is unconstitutional; but so is a federal law ALLOWING gay marriage. Gay marriage is not in the Constitution, so it is up to each individual state to decide.  I do find it interesting, though, that you're a Christian and yet you support something that the founder of your religion did not support. Jesus'd be proud.

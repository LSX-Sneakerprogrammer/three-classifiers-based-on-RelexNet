You can't make a valued judgement on whether something is true or not if you have no evidence    I did proposed evidence: Books and morality.   And i do get it. Why am i wrong when i said that belief may be truth or may not be truth backed with no strong evidence to support it? Knowledge is knowledge whether or not if it backed up with evidence or not. You don't need to prove knowledge with evidence because knowledge is already proven by existence.    Believe is never knowledge   That is true. Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact. However, why say it when what you believe in turns out to be knowledge after all.    WRONG. Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area.   How was i wrong when i stated "too much people to carry?" Or when i stated when "the amount of people exceed the normal amount?" I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.    First, why does it have to be only female homosexuals?  Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter. And it is not only female homosexuals; it is mostly female homosexuals.    Second, you are misconstruing "society" and "population". According to the OED, "society" refers to "Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship." On the other hand, "population" refers to "A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it."   You are right. However, without people, there isn't a society in existence. So that is why i interpret society as the population. But next time as i write, i will remind myself, hopefully, of the difference.     So, while homosexuality might not increase the population size, this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Society cannot grow independently of population. Didn't you state that society refers to the "association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship?" Without people, there isn't a society. That is like saying a house with no family has family rules. And i mean of a house that never had a family in the first place.    It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.    There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism. And others that i already suggested. I don't think it is a hasty remark. An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed. But then again, maybe everything in the book was all done for "fun."   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality. I had stated, maybe not to you, that homosexuality can become mathmaticians and scientists. Those are clearly two professions that can develop a society into a growing society. And homosexuals can adopt children.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law. So i can fairly say put society and its population in the same hand. However, these two are not exactly the same.    And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   You didn't prove that my both scenarios are untrue. In the first scenario, you stated a question that has no effect on the changing of the scenario. Second, you made a difference to population and society but that doesn't make my scenario fallacious. They are a dinstinction but not a total one. I say to you to go into a forest and start a family with two homosexual women and two homosexual men. And in this scenario, you cannot adopt children. Can you think you can grow as a society? No, unless the women are allowing the men to impregnate themselves.    You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of most of the suffering of the Jewish people?   Im wrong for taking Hitler's life because that is against morality itself. Morality doesn't want me to kill another one of my kind. Morality's best evidence is viewed within oneself. Hitler isn't the cause of the most suffering of the Jewish people. However, thanks to him and the Nazis, the Jews were sent to the concentration camps. Of course, there are many causes. Evidence: well the best evidence i can give is wikipedia.    A rapist cannot try to rape a person. He has already raped a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   I should has said "serial rapists." But lol of course a rapist can try to rape. If a man rapes, he is known as a rapist. If that man against tries to rape, then it is a rapist trying to rape. I honestly believe your statement was silly to make. And your statement doesn't make my argument fallacious.    The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it might or might not be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China relative to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   As stated by wikipedia, the policy came to be to control the population. I don't have the exact quotes from China's officials but it is obvious that the overpopulation was feared. Now in March 2011, the Chinese goverment is allowing its citizens to have a second couple. That is a contradiction to the original policy but it is still truthful. Again, my source is wikipedia.    Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   If you can't find the similiarities between the policy and homosexuality, i ask you, what are you smoking? But i don't want to assume you are a smoker. I think that is rude.   Overall, you didn't prove my two scenarios are fallacious.  Edit. This is a contradiction. In some sense i can see society exist without its people. I see it if i think of it as a concept. However, i don't see it in another light. In this light when all society's people die, i see society vanishing because there is no one to support it. True contradictions. Tho not all contradictions are true.

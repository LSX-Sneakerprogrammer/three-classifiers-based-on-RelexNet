Here is a thought for you. Imagine a large island with just gay people and they are allowed to marry. How long would that population last?   Consider Webster's definition of dysfunctional in regards sociology; a consequence of a social practice or behavior pattern that undermines the stability of a social system.  So someone please tell me why it would be a good idea to legalize dysfunction. Is that not the antithesis of government?  And just for the record. Homosexuality is not a person, it is a behavior. My comments against homosexuality are directed at the behavior, not the people practicing it. I love those caught in the gay lifestyle and want to see them set free.  And for those in the gay lifestyle. You are not a homosexual, you are a human being.

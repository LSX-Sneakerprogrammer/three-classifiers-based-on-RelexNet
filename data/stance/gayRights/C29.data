I guarantee if they had listened to your advice from the start you would be complaining about how they weren't following the law    Screw you Mr. clairvoyant. You don't know a thing about me.   You could argue that allowing blacks to go to the same bathrooms and schools as whites was forcing racists to do something they didn't want.   NO, I can't argue that. What I can argue is that what finally allowed blacks to use the same bathrooms and school as  equals  was educating the next generation. You can't legislate morality. Just because they made a law that allowed blacks to use the same bathroom and schools as whites did not create an atmosphere where blacks were all of a sudden, magically, accepted as equals. It took time and education.  Again, spell out for me these rights for me. You can't do it ;) can you ;)

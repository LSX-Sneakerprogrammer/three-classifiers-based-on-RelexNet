Gays are constantly in your face sticking their sins into your face. Justifying their sins. Making others accept their sins. Legalizing their sins. Trying to make gay marriage and then legalise it etc.   Are they? I don't find that at all. Has a gay stuck his sin in your face? oh how telling.   If there wasn't any of that bullshit... with men sitting on each others laps in public etc. I don't think I'd say a word and let them be. Instead they're trying to get me and other people to allow them into our daily lives.   So because they do things that you don't like and they are not hurting you or anyone at all, you feel obligated to label them and protest against their rights to be happy. "Me thinks the lady does protest too much" if you know what I mean, their is a bit too much frequency in your protest when talking about homosexuals, which would lead to the inference that you are a closet homosexual.  Anything you would like to confess?  I think you would feel much better for it.   Lmao wut????   Peodophobe, fear of children or dolls, genius.   Anyway cockmuncher...  .....you're gay.   That is news to me, I am sure my wife will be upset when she hears it. How should I tell her? I am sure you have prepared your coming out speech, any tips? You can label me all you want, it only makes you more of a bigot.   The link you posted?  Kind of bullshit. Ever watched Scrottie Mcboogerballs? South Park where it shows how people read into things that aren't there?   Like hermeneutics religious scriptures of all kinds are open to interpretation, it is telling that some one such as your self will disregard teachings in favor of their own personal views, oh and I do agree with you on the South Park example all religious documents are misread generally because they are filled to the brim with bullshit and any cretin with a bent for justifying his own immoral stance quote mines from scripture then sets about ruining the lives of innocent people.

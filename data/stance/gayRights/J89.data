Come on you are over thinking this. It is about wat the child wants and since being gay is more acceptabel then less bulling for them i guess but saying homophobic stuff like it's disgusting thats why it's hard to live life you always have to worry about wat some one thinks. I APLUDE OPEN GAYS! THEY STAND UP TO BULLIES AND DON'T CARE WAT THEY SAY ISAY YOU GO GAY! ;)

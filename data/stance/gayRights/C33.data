you must think homosexuality is wrong to not want it to even be legal. even things like divorce that many people would disagree with is legal.  I think there must be some harm in order to make things illegal and i have seen no one present a cogent argument that shows the harm that gay marriage will do (except to the bigotries of religious people).  If you don't think so, then WHY!!!? Just cuz you don't like it is not sufficient.

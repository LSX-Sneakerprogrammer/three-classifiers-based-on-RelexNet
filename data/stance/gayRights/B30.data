Hello, Terminator. The issue isn't about sex. It's about whether certain people should be allowed to marry. I've been reading some of your posts and it doesn't seem to be the case that you actually have a reason as to why homosexuals shouldn't be allowed to marry.   Prove it.   It's simple. You can get married without the religious ritual. But you can't get married without a state license. The ritual has historically acted as a rite of passage, but not the actual thing that makes you "married".   Does marriage have a religious origin?   No. Marriage has always been a state institution, always requiring the recognition of the state regardless of what ritual religious or secular is attached to it.

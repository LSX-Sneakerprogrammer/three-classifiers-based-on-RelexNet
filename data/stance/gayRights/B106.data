Nearly all ancient civilisations/religions agree with me on most points.  In China the Confunacists said that the first duty is to raise a family and take care of them and overlooked homosexuality if it was discreet and private.  The Greeks said that those who penetrated were dominant and masculine and those who got penetrated (LOL!!!) were feminine and submissive.  I could go on forever.. but none of the cultures allowed gay marriage.  Not many had open gay relations  etc. etc.  TBH they are generally in line with me. Good to know that.

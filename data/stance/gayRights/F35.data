However, they DO NOT get to claim the title of marriage and receive the benefits of marriage when there is no such a thing!  http://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/marriage   read it and weep!   Please read my first argument, where you will see me clearly accept that a gay marriage is technically impossible. However, we can bend the rules a little bit, and Merriam Webster agrees with me. I quote   the state of being united to a person of the same sex in a relationship like that of a traditional marriage  .  So, as you can see, gay marriage is possible in a non-technical way.   It is not recognized by our constitution as a right. The end. And it won't get added. If a state wants to legalize it they can try.   Firstly, that's your constitution, not mine. Now, I'll be honest. I don't know a great deal about the constitution. But I know that it's not the be all and end all of everything. Public support for gay marriage is at an all time high. The President publicly came out to support it. If that's not convincing enough, I don't know what is.

Who taught you how to read? " If  you don't..."  I was only challenging you to make an actually point. Which, at the time, you were not doing. I didn't actually want you to shut up.   "And I'm not accusing the country of everything."   I meant anything. But everything does work, too. Because everything includes anything. And no, I didn't accuse the country of anything or everything. I am blaming your religion for oppressing people. Your religion used lies and fear mongering, in order to change the law via 'democracy', to do so. And that is wrong, in my opinion.  And what lies?   http://www.samspadesf.com/2008/10/ prop-8-lies-and-facts-you-sort-them- out.html    Those were the 'facts' that the Mormon church, from Utah, paid to spread in California. None of it was true.

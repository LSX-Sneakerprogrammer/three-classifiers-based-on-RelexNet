Heres where you screwed yourself... well first off, in your mother's basement, where you obviously reside.  Secondly, when you said, "Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families?"  I believe that you're implying that all families are sad and distraught over their child's homosexuality? This is not the case.  Homosexuality can be accepted, tolerated, and celebrated. Just because you are a homosexual doesn't mean that you are in defiance of anything.  You are embracing your own feelings. You are being true to yourself. I would argue that someone who does not love themselves, should not attempt to love anyone else. You have to love yourself, and you have to have a genuine love for someone else in order to successfully raise a child. The child understand that love. He or she can learn that there are many types of love, and that it can be expressed in whatever way, with whomever he or she finds suitable for them. But that child needs just an example of love.  Shut up and listen, for once.  Love is all you need.

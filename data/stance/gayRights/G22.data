The point is that either one is not fixed. Laws can and have been changed, just like definitions. You are making an appeal to a standard that in the final analysis is no standard.   So my real point in all this is: If there is no transcendent; then all we are left with is personal opinions and might makes right (survival of the fittest)  Remember those lines from the Deceleration of Independence;  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights   They got it right. Laws and rights are only properly grounded when they are grounded in the transcendent. And the Creator says that homosexuality is out of bounds. To go against Him would be cosmic treason and that is always fatal to nations and people; God plays for keeps.

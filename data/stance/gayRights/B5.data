And I loathe stupidity. There is a logical reason to engage in homosexual behavior...it's natural. It doesn't detrimentally affect society, and it does not infringe on another's right to self-determination. Logic would dictate laws that preventing same sex couples from marriage while allowing heterosexual couples to marry is fundamentally unfair and antiquated.

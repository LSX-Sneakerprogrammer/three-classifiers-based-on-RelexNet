In my opinion, marriage is between a man and a woman. If we are talking about marriage in the sense of a union recognized by the church, then absolutely not. A marriage in the church is for a man and a woman ONLY. HOWEVER! I do think that if two men, or two women want to be recognized legally as a couple, then they ought to have the right to a civil union. They would be legally recognized as married, but not recognized by the church. If they wanted to have a "ceremony" of sorts, that's fine, it just won't be recognized by the church. Legal marriage: yes. Holy marriage: no.

I don't really know what you mean with this comment, are you against or not?  It is the most normal thing to want to marry the one you love, and I don't think anyone should stop ANYONE!! not matter sex or skincolor. The only thing I want to stop when talking 'marriage', is kids marriage. You know, old men marrying little girs like they do in Iran and other islamic contries.  I think you should put your strenght on stopping those psycho marriages, instead of stopping innocent love between two men or two women.

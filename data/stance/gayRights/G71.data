Technically "Gay Marriage" doesn't exist. The people defined marriage as between a man and a woman. [prop 8]  I don't see why they can't make their own civil unions.  My stance has nothing to do with religion because I believe in separation of church and state. I'm just saying that marriage is our thing and they should get there own thing.   "we try to force being stright on americans and say its a sin"   Who is "we"? Of course there are crazy people in the streets with stupid signs. Don't let then tarnish your view of straight Christian America.

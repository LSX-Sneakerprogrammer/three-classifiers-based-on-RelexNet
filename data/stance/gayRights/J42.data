Pineapple let's give him the benefit of the doubt that he can't click links and I will tell him what the site says okay?  Here were some of the lies spread by the Proponents of Prop 8:   Prop 8 doesn't discriminate against homosexuals.  Prop 8 took away a right that gays already had. They were able to get married, and the passage of prop 8 took away that right. Regardless of whether not you agree with prop 8, it took away a right they already had and therefore is discrimination.   Children will be taught that same-sex marriage is ok  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you do not live in California. I cannot tell you how many ads I saw talking about how children would learn that homosexuality is alright. Regardless of how intolerant that is, it is a lie. Prop 8 mentioned nothing about education, and the California Superintendent of Schools Jack O'Connell assured everyone that Prop 8 did not even mention education and under California law, parents can remove their children from any health or family instruction they disagree with.   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=Ys6jnC11Svs    There is no reason for them to be mentioning kids.  Oh by the way in watching that clip I found a lie. Well more of a half-truth. "Both presidential candidates support traditional marriage." What they don't say is that Obama opposed prop 8 and any ban on same-sex marriage. He took a lame wishy-washy stance, but he still opposed prop 8 and the video implied that he did not.   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=aiX5APGCroU&feature;=related    A little under a minute and a half in: "The rights of children are at risk. Children have the right to be raised by a mother and father."   This has nothing do with kids. Nothing in proposition 8 affected education or adoption. It was all lies and propaganda.  Another gem in that video. "We need to protect religious freedoms." So how does forcing everyone else to abide by your religion protect religious freedom? That seems a bit bassackwards to me.  Your religion was the main source of funds behind this campaign and all of these advertisements. Please I beg you, try to really think critically about all of this.

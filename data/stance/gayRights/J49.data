It being a 'sin' is irrelevant.    Minds are like parachutes, they only function when open.   You say yours eyes are open, that's great. Now try your brain.  Homosexuality has been a sin for only about 2000 years now...   You are a product of brainwashing. I'm not going to say that again, because as a product, you can't understand it. But you need to open your mind and understand that  there is nothing wrong with being gay!   And again, the bible is not meant to be applied to law. So YES, gays should adopt.  And what is a family to you?  Family is an ambiguous word these days. I hope you don't have that picturesque little household with a white picket fence, with a mom and dad, and a Golden Retriever who brings in the paper, et cetera... because  that  would be weird.  It's a matter of perception. And I have to tell you that other than biblical references, there is no excuse for thinking being gay is wrong. Or for thinking that gay people can't raise children. They aren't retarded. They understand the world, and the people in it. And they have love to give, and can create a stable environment for a child just as well as a straight couple.  Every difference is trivial.

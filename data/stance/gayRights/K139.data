Historically, marriage has meant a union between a man and a woman. If it has ever meant anything other than that, then I would like to see that proof.  When racists said that a black person could not marry a white person, they lost in the courts because the historical definition has been "a union between a man and a woman" not "a union between a man and a woman of the same race."  Racists did not try to claim ownership of the word. The racists tried to change the definition of the word and lost. As they should have.  Now a new group wants to change the definition of the word once again and they should lose that battle but they should win the battle to get their rights.

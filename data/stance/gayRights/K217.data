I utterly and irrefutably agree with your view. My concern has always been the emotional, social, mental and particularly the psychological wellbeing of the child. For instance, one growing up with two fathers would merely destroy their sense of belonging. Consider the bullies out there, those who do discriminate on the basis of one’s sexuality. Although I’m against discrimination, I think it’s undoubtedly wrong to be married to someone of the same gender as you. It does in fact mentally hurt a child, to the extent where their perspective on life is altered as they age, wishing they had two heterosexual parents. They themselves would begin to ponder on whether ‘Gay marriage’ and ‘Homosexuality’ is acceptable and serves as ‘normal’. It’s so sad to see that there is a significant rise in Gay marriages, somewhat indicating humankind has lost all respect for their true purpose and ultimately, for God. The Bible, a sacred text which all knowledge is derived from, acts as a source of teaching. This teaching encapsulates the wrongness of homosexuality and places emphasis on the fact that one will not be able to inherit the kingdom of God if they are homosexual. We all know this. Although one cannot rely on the Bible to teach them absolutely EVERYTHING about life as not all is contained, we must also have common sense and recognize that gay marriage is not natural. Despite the so-called ‘love’ that supposedly exists between the two so-called ‘lovers’ who are led to believe that one of them plays the role of a ‘girl’ whilst the other wears the pants, my point is: Gay marriage does not serve to fulfil the purpose of a real marriage which is PROCREATION. Adopting a child is far worse, bringing an innocent human-being into your life to illustrate and teach to them your own wrong-doings, consequently influencing them to view it as acceptable. Please man, where’s the brains.

That is exactly what I am saying.  You aren't making any sense - Congress determining the effect of a marriage law from one state on another is overturning the state law in this instance not overturning the FFC clause.  You began by saying that the reason custody rights would not be in question is because of the FFC clause, now you agree that a law in one state (e.g. marriage and it's corresponding custody rights/obligations) would not need to be enforced in another state - which is correct and what I have been saying.   Did you not notice that my first response to your post said "Supported" ?? Then you began to argue against something which I never said.   A state would just say yep we recognize you got married in another state, but that means nothing here. from DOMA:  of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship." - this is Congress' determination of the effect of marriage laws in one state on another. The FFC clause gives them the power to make this determination   No it doesn't. FFC basically says that one state must recognize the marriages of other states and DOMA basically says "states don't have to recognize gay marriages of other states". It contradicts FFC. DOMA is an exception, not an effect. It is entirely unconstitutional, on multiple grounds. It violates the FFC clause and it violates the tenth amendment, because the federal government is not delegated the power by the Constitution to determine the legality of marriages, this is reserved to the states, unless of course if you include the equal protection clause in which case it would still make DOMA unconstitutional.

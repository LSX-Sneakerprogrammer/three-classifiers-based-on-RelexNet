What do you mean that many states are going through the same thing as California? They voted it down... so the people in California did not support gay marriage.   Should we keep allowing people to vote and then the majority rules or just make the decision to allow it? Personally I would vote to allow it, but don't those that don't support it have a right to voice their thoughts at the polling place?

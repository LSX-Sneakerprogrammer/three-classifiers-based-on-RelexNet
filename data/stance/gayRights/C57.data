Well, in California, it did go to the Supreme Court, and guess what? They said gay marriage was legal! But then, Prop 8 was passed. The people campaigning for Prop 8 used fear to get people to vote for it. They scared people into thinking that their children would be affected by gay marriage.  The only way to ensure the right of homosexuals to marry would be to get an amendment passed. This would be virtually impossible though because there is still a lot of homophobia in the U.S. Also Church's, like the Mormon Church, encouraged their members to donate money and vote for Prop 8.   Honestly right now, religion is the biggest deterrent in this whole process. The only legitimate reasons against gay marriage are religious ones (i.e. sanctity of marriage) and of course this is a secular nation, so therefore they shouldn't sway people. Unfortunately they do.  To sum up, I have no idea. Fight homophobia would be my biggest suggestion. And maybe tax church's who take political stances on issues?

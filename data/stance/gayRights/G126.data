there are several good reasons for expanding the definition of marriage to include gay marriage -- reasons like fairness, liberty, and equality   Gay people are currently free to do anything they want, so in terms of fairness, liberty and equality, gay people are not disadvantaged at all.   .   You can just tell your kids, "Legally it's a contract between two people, but if you ask me, it's a union between a man and a woman done for the purpose of raising children."   I'd rather not have to stray from the legal definition. Kids are always accusing parents of saying something and then do something else. This will add to that problem.  .  I'm not advocating that we stop gay unions. How can we? It's love right? You can't stop love! Perhaps we should move on to discuss the specific rights of a married couple  vs  those of united gay couples, see where there might be discrepancies and why they exist, and adjust it if there's no good reasons for them.

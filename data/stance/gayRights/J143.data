Gay couples are just like straight couples. You tend to fully judge, what you don't fully understand.  Gay parents get things done. Just like a modern straight couple might have a "Mr. Mom" who stays home, while the wife goes to work, doesn't mean that that couple wont be good parents.  There are many untraditional families who make it work. Just because they don't have to body parts you find fit, doesn't mean they can't raise children.  One father can take on the role of the mother. He can be feminine and caring, loving et cetera. These "roles" you place on parents are just an illusion.  There is no one, right way to raise a child.

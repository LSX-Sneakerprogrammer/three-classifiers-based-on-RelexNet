OK, so let me say back to you what I understood you say. A group of people (who hate gays) successfully figured out a way to either circumvent, or navigate thought, the system. Now, isn't that what I'm telling gays to do?  But more importantly, lets say that you are 100 % correct and that the law sacrificed unmarried heterosexuals in order to strike back at homosexuals. I think that you would agree that this would be a very spiteful and hateful thing to do. Now, are you telling me that you want to try and change those people's mind and remain living there. Let me ask you a question. Do you really think that just because a law is passed that people all of the sudden are going to change their mind and stop hating you? And you really want to keep living there? Knowing that you are hated and despised for forcing something down their throats? Something they didn't want? Let me see.... what is it that some white people do when "undesirables" move into their neighborhoods? Who benefits? Which is the best course of action to take?

I swear everything you've said makes you look dumb... If your mom and dad broke up how would they share custody of their kids being a gay couple with kids doesn't make them different from anyone else. So there's no determining who's the better parent or who gets custody or anything we're all normal and the same no matter who or what gender we chose to be with.

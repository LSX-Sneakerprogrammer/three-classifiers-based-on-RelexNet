You didn't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial (in scenario 2) and not beneficial (in scenario 1).   I have shown your scenarios to be wrong.   [Taken from my previous comment]   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only female homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.  Response to premise 1:  First, why does it have to be only female homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing "society" and "population". According to the OED, "society" refers to "Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship." On the other hand, "population" refers to "A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it." So, while homosexuality might not increase the population size, this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.  Response to premise 2:  It is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.

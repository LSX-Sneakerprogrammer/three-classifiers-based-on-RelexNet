This leads back to my original argument: It is not logical to engage in intercourse for any purpose other than procreation.  However, seeing how nobody can comprehend this form of logic (I call it 'Vulcanian logic'), I shall have to think of another argument.  Here's an argument:  Religion  is  (I know that you'll disagree!) a religious rite.  Another argument:  Marriage is betwixt a man and a woman, can a homosexual marriage truly  be  a marriage?   Condoms prevent the spread of disease.   Only 27% of teenage females who engage in coitus do so with their partner wearing a condom.

Oh there it is again, that arbitrary standard of consent. Remember the demand for gay marriage is; " because we love each other" If I could demonstrate that my cat loves me it could be proven that on some level the cat consents because it doesn't run away when I show it love, therefore, we should get married.   If love and consent equals marriage all I have to do is demonstrate that my relationships posses those two qualities and I should be able to marry the object of my affection. To oppose me you would have to invoke another standard. But to that I would ask; On what grounds do you object, your personal preference? How is what you prefer relevant to what I prefer?

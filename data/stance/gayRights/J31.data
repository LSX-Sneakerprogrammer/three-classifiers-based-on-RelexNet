"Ad hominem is when you insult someone instead of addressing the argument in question."   Well in that case I'm not guilty. If anything I'm the one that tried to tell people how ridiculous it is to do that.    "How exactly did she falsely accuse the country of anything?"   By saying that this country allows oppression. It does not. Yes it has in the past. But nothing to that degree is going on right now.    "Your church specifically I might add was primarily responsible for the passage of Proposition 8 due it's significant funding of an intolerant and fear-mongering campaign."   Intolerant? Fear mongering? How so?    "I think this is your biggest problem. You accept everything your parents, priest, etc. tell you and don't even look for reasons because "it's so obvious.""   Okay maybe it was a lame thing to say, I guess the ad homonym is contagious. But if I wasn't looking for a reason then I would go with the flow, not go to church, and do what is easy. Does that sound familiar to you?    "Oppression: unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power"   I guess then, that I am being oppressed by you two double teaming me on every freaking debate.

Guess what? Marriage is a "civil union".   In order to get married, you need a license from a government office. You can't get it from a religious organization. That makes marriage a civil matter.  The meaning of "civil" in this situation is "of or pertaining to civil law". Civil law is "the body of laws of a state or nation regulating ordinary private matters, as distinct from laws regulating criminal, political, or military matters."  One definition of "union" is "the act of uniting or an instance of being united in marriage". As I said, marriage is a civil union.

I am not against homosexuals at all but I think marriage should be reserved for man and woman. Many people I know agree they don't want their children to see two homosexuals holding hands and making out in the middle of the street so that their children think it is alright and (if religious) God intended that. Unless the marriage is not at a church and there's no religion involved I don't think it is right. I'm okay with them just signing papers though. I believe it does hurt people because as my first example said many straight parents don't want their children thinking such a thing is natural and it also strongly disturbs some people.

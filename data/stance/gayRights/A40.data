Here is my argument and it may differ with what i stated previously (don't forget my thinking changes)   If your thinking has changed, you're admitting that you are wrong, as I have shown. My thinking is iron clad and my position has not wavered throughout the debate. Your thinking on the other hand seems to be arbitrary. Thus, it seems like either you are too stupid to cling on to a position or that you have been proven wrong.   belief is knowledge if it is knowledge   Which obviously makes no sense as a statement  at all  since it is merely begging the question. And thus, whatever you say subsequently on this statement is fallacious.   Belief is an opinon that may or may not be true.   Wrong. It is an opinion that  has not been proven  to be true or false.   Knowledge is truth.   Wrong. Knowledge is  justified true belief . It is not merely that it is true. It is also justified. To be considered knowledge, a belief  must  fulfill three conditions:  1. The statement must be a statement of "belief".  2. The statement must be a statement of "belief"  that is true .  3. The statement must be a statement of "belief"   that has been proven   that  that is true .   Overpopulation means when population exceeds the normal amount.   Wrong. It doesn't matter that it exceeds "the normal amount". Population growth exceeds "the normal amount" but it doesn't mean that just because the population is growing, there  is  overpopulation. Population growth  might lead to  overpopulation, but it doesn't necessarily result in overpopulation  immediately . Overpopulation occurs when the population grows and exceeds the carrying capacity of an area such that it results in a fall in standard of living. If you can't understand that, either you have the IQ of an amoeba or you're too arrogant to admit that you're wrong. I  know  that I am not wrong because as a Geography scholar, I have studied population geography for a whole year and know my definitions well.  Gosh, you don't seem to be too smart. Check the dictionary if you need to.   Because whether or not i answer you doesn't change the scenario.   Which doesn't make it wrong. You still haven't shown why my criticisms of your argument as unjustified. Thus, your scenario is a false one.   Im not whining.   And yes, you are whining. You arguments aren't iron clad. In fact, it is a sieve with huge holes. More accurately, it is like a tower of cards that falls at the slightest challenge.   What do you mean to prove that it is mostly female homosexuals?   Since you  claimed  that it is "mostly female homosexuals", then justify your claim. Simple as that. Can't you understand simple English, idiot?   It is a scenario. I created it.   Yeah, I get that, moron. I have shown that it is a  FALSE ANALOGY  and you haven't disputed me.   Questions cannot change the scenario. It is what it is.   I don't want to change the scenario, stupid. I am showing why it is wrong.   I had never implied that so your entire arguement about this fails.   Yes you have so my argument holds true.   The term population doesn't really mean blooming in size.   I didn't say that. I said that population  growth  means blooming in size. Learn to read will you? What a prick.   When i say population, i simply mean people.   Which is ontologically wrong.   And i didn't know that eskimos have a rich society and culture.   Since you're an ignoramus, I didn't expect you to.   Not all societies conquer. I was wrong to imply all.    DUH...    In some ways societies can grow with homosexuals. In some ways, they can't.   Which has no bearing on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry or not. Thus, such a statement is not only a contradiction to what you have previously said, it is also a red herring.  Again, until your reply my criticisms, this debate is over.  --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---------

M a Christian for example.... Your morals and judgements are shared with billions of other people.    Morality is a mine field,you walk into it blindfolded and you'll get killed... If your morals are not further backed up by science or other sources than... Well...   Morality is no longer a valid argument unless proven by science... At least morality motivated by religion.   Marriage... Marriage began as a business agreement between 2(or more....) families to combine Resources between them. The arguement that marriage is a religous binding and that it is strictly between this and this kind of individual is none-the-less wrong. Besides, marriage even now is longer just a religous binding, it is a legal significance "The Church does not rule the state." If a heterosexual couple is allowed to engage in these legal matters, then shouldn't a homosexual one?   Be as cruel as up you want.

A) I love how it was religion that was women's outlets.  B) Greeks are whites even though a lot of their philosophy was derived/similar to asian philosophy.  C) Articles written by women obviously biasedly focusing on some inequalities. They never mention how men died in their millions so that women could live.  last I checked everyone was different and all people are too be treated as equals.  Last I checked paedophiles (etc. etc.) were not treated as equals either. You want gay rights.. you best give all these sick fucks rights.  Call the gays civil partners then. Not married. Simples.  I don't have to believe in God or follow religion to have the same arguments I have.

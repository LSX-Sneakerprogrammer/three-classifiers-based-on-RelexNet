I think the author of this debate should change the word "homos" to "homosexuals." It sounds insulting.   Anyway, here is my dispute.    And you are telling them what their purpost in life is.   I believe that the purpose in life is to grow and advance. In a sense, homosexuals are NOT WRONG because they stop the world from overpopulation. However, in another sense, it is wrong due to the fact that it stops the world from growing in numbers. I believe this is the purpose of life because it is programmed in our heads. We fear the tip of the blame touching our heart because we do not want to die. We go to school because we want to better ourselves. If i had a billion dollars, i don't want to spend the rest of my life playing on my Nintendo Wii. If i do that, i would feel like im wasting my own life. I believe i can say the same about you because i can sense it. I can sense wrong, ha ha.   Therefore, i believe, MOST men and women must be attracted to each other to inorder to grow and advane as a human race.

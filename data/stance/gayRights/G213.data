1. You really spelled faggots wrong.  2. Saying "fags" is rude and demeaning.  3. By saying that everyone who voted "yes" is a homosexual, you are being ignorant to the world around you. I myself am not gay, but I do have friends and family who are. There is no difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals besides the gender of the person that they love. And if God did create all, then why did he create homosexuals? I'm sorry that you are to arrogant to realize this.

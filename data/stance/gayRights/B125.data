MAYBE being gay isn't a choice.  But you don't have to live a homosexual lifestyle.  But you're not born gay. Aslong as that remains true then maybe we can do something to cure the disease/sickness/disorder.  No being a man is a lot of things but one of them is definately to be straight. There are extreme and I mean EXTREME and by that i mean  EXTREME!!  exceptions where a faggot can be considered a man... but in general the rulse stands.

lol it totally makes sense.   No, it makes no sense. I'm glad you find this amusing because I certainly don't. If you treat criticism as a joke, I have every right to assume that you're incapable of rational thought.   Knowledge isn't something that pops up. It already exists in this earth.   What do you mean by "already exists"? Is knowledge a brute fact?   You too stated that overpopulation means that the population exceeds the normal amount.   I have never stated that. You are putting words in my mouth, idiot. I have always maintained that overpopulation refers to the situation where the population  exceeds the carrying capacity of the area . If you haven't read that when I've written it three times previously, then you are truly a pinhead.   No, it doesn't make it wrong. It makes it pointless.   A pointless analogy is the definition of a "false analogy". That is a technical term in philosophy. Obviously, you aren't trained in philosophy. That is still not an excuse for stupidity.   I did justify your claim.   I asked you to justify  YOUR  claim, not mine. What an idiot. If you justify my claim, then you are supporting my view. Obviously, you're not. So why don't you give reasons for your claim?   Simply trying to prove it is wrong doesn't even make logical sense.   It doesn't make logical sense to a person who can't debate.   I haven't disputed you because you haven't disputed me.   Yes I have disputed you. Refer to my previous arguments because, as I have said, this debate is over until you reply to my criticisms and stop attacking straw men.   I don't what you mean that it is ontologically wrong.   Which proves that your command of English is atrocious.   In one sense, the population is the people. In another sense, the population is the number of people.   And therefore, you are ontologically wrong.   My argument is soley about not marriage, but whether or not homosexuality is right and/or wrong.   Which is exactly  NOT  the debate in question.   A society with mostly homosexuals can be beneficial or not. It depends.   Which is not your position.   Im appalled that you don't even get this. And its annoying.   The same, and more, can be said of you.

People can and do get married by Elvis Preisley lookalikes in Las Vegas, so clearly the Church is not the only institution that can perform marriages- plus, there are registry offices that perform marriage services (at least here in the UK there are).   Plus, since when is being a good Christian about being anti-homosexuality? Jesus himself would spend time with lepers, and outcasts, and anyone who everyone else considered worthless or beneath them. Jesus opened his arms to EVERYONE, and it's not stated anywhere that he decided to hate gays.

Homosexuality is legalized voyeurism, thus making homosexuals more equal than others. Homosexuality is not an Identity, but more resembles Dissociative Identity Disorder without the memory lost. Once you have the ability to change your sexual orientation as has been proven in our recent past (gays becoming straight and vicei versa) it's a choice. If Africans had that choice during the time of slavery Jim Crow laws would have been obsolete. The logical conclusion to address the imbalance to our society would to institutionalize unisex toilets. This would open the doorway for sexual deviants to molest your children and womenfolk with their eyes once they don't touch. I was once told that in a perfect world unisex toilets would be fine, but our society isnâ€™t. Nature, Nurture, Genes or Hormones, we were given two (2) boxes, male and female and 99% of us have been equipped to know where we belong. Thus we need to have the self-control and discipline to stay in those boxes. If you need help to bridge the gap between what you ought to do and what you are doing, welcome to the human race. Iron is supposed to sharpen Iron. I will follow the debate attentively for your objections.

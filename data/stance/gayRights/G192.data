Um, guess what. Rejection of homosexuals "leads to high rates of suicide, infectious diseases, depression and a reduction of life expectancy by 20yrs"..that is, if any of what you say is at all true.  And guess what else? Your denigration of peoples sexuality by calling it a "lifestyle" denies US citizens of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. It's not a lifestyle fella. Its a life.  And sure. Overthrow the government because people decide to stop denying other people equal rights? Sounds like a plan to me. Not a good plan. Just a plan.

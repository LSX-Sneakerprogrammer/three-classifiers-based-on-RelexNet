Agreed. Marriage has its roots as a business arrangement. If you do want to start talking about marriages in the context of religious texts, you will even see it was about joining families or trading women for goats. Women were property and men were allowed to have multiple concubines, mistresses, etc. So I'm not sure saying "it has religious roots" is the best angle. Furthermore, even if it did "because we always did it that way" is not a valid reason to take away rights. . see e.g., women's and civil rights movements

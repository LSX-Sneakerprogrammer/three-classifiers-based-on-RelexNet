For those who are against same-sex marriage, I dare you to give one RATIONAL reason why it shouldn't be allowed. Without brawling biblical recitings.  If you say they can't because you say "It was not adam and steve", you have no point. Adam and eve were not married at the first place. So the fact that they were a male and a female, is a worthless point. It has nothing to do with marriage. If you believe in that story, consider that they have 2 sons, and still they are the beginning of mankind. Hallo incest!  I myself don't believe in the bible, so I don't care what it says anyways.  If you start brawling about Leviticus, you should think then that, in god's opinion, all sins are equal. In the bible, eating shrimps is a sin...  If you say that it shouldn't be allowed because they can't produce any offspring, you have no point either. If you claim that, well you should also forbid straight marriages with no offspring... I think gay marriages would let the divorce-rates go down, what about that then.  There is scientific proof, some animals have a gay lifestyle. And animals don't have a conscience or can't reason. Therefor being gay isn't a choice.   I truly believe that marriage is about love en caring between two loving beings. If they can express that, they should be married. No one could stand in their way with a rational reason.  And I am sure that evolution will ensure that close-mindness will be abandoned.

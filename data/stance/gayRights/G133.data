The simple fact that heterosexuality is different than homosexuality does not sway me far. The only determinant to mairrage is love. Two people who are not in love do not marry, as would be expected. Two who are, then may. Reason will always surpass wordplay (if only politicians thought this way)  Also, if you consider men and women to be equal, which I do, your equasion supports my view.

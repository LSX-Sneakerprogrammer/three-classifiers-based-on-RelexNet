In my own personal opinion being homosexual isn't right and thats it.  And the communites around me doesn't get too involved in homosexual activicties even the government.  It's common to see girls and boys hanging out together but not boys and boys hugging each other touching here an there.  Kids learn from their parents and it's monkey see monkey do. When babies were born, they are weak and they are dependant on their mothers or those whom they think is his/her parents that he/she could relate to. Kids learn from their parents because it's the parents responsiblity to teach their children what is right and what is wrong and not someone elses.  Unless you're trying to prove to me that the parent's role isn't to teach the children what is nature and what is not according to nature etc. you cannot have sex with a man like you did with a woman.  It's impossible unless that man was a woman before a sex change operation and was reluctant to change her organs.  What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature.  Firstly, the environment i grew up in doesn't have too much catholics and christians but mostly made up of other religions. I personally abhor christianity because of its contradictions and it's violation of karma.  One quote i recieved from my friend who is a christian. He was determined to convert me from a buddhist to a christian but once i heard it i brushed him aside.  'If you don't believe in Jesus christ, you shall go to hell'.  This is a total piece of bullshit, who in the world needs to go to hell when he is accumulating merits here and there is no such thing as absolute creator god who creates the whole universe in seven days.  And god don't love us too.  If he has the powers of a clairvoyant and loves us, if he saw the future of man he would'nt have created us in the first place. He would'nt have created Adam and Eve in the first place.  And if he truly is an absolute god he would'nt have creatd lucifer whom he knew that one day lucifier is going to turn bad and become satan.  Christianity is bulljunk and i totally hate it.  Although i hate christianity i don't really hate christians.  I only dislike those who is obessed with it.

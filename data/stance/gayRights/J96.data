This is true. Since this issue is so recent, I don't think we have any long-term studies about the effects of gay adoption, but maybe we'll have a better understanding in 10 or 20 years. However, I feel that during arguments it is better to argue from a logical standpoint, as opposed to an emotional one. Still, I agree with your stance.

If you're looking at it religiously then religious attitudes should be modified to reflect the changes in society. Many religious views are outdated and no longer justifiable ( women play a subservient role to men in the world). Conversely, gay couples should be allowed the option to undergo civil marriages, this does not entail any religious ceremonies and ought to be acceptable to those who object to gay marriages on the grounds of their religious beliefs.   2 people that are in love deserve to be married no matter what their sexual preferences may be. That's discrimination, we need to abolish discrimination as a whole. We should all feel complete empathy towards our fellow man despite his or her anything. It just shouldn't matter.

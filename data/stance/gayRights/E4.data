By banning gay adoption, children in gay couple households have no legal status should something happen to the parents, including death or serious illness.   The child cannot claim inheritances or other household assets in case of death.   If one parent dies, the second parent has no legal right to take custody or care for the child.   A parent without legal right to a child cannot legally register him/her for school.   Parents cannot put children on some health insurance plans.   Parents cannot make medical decisions for the child.   * The child has no claim to the social security or other insurance benefits of the parent.   Gay couple parents without adoption rights do not benefit from the generous tax deductions granted to heterosexual parents.

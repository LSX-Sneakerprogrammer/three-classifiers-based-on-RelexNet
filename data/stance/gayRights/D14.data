Let the religious establishments keep their outdated rules and regulations concerning the ever advancing and evolving entity which is the human race, eventually they will govern no one as more and more people realize their flawed system and lack of truth. Let’s not let it have control any longer.  I move for an option that enables any couple to be united if they choose to. Let the state write a document that joins them in this case and do away with the goofy ceremonies and ancient traditions that are older than grave dust.  Or better yet, let us recognize marriage and other outdated “laws” and traditions as what they are, restrictions prescribed during a time when everything from the sun to human psychology was misunderstood. Why do we feel the need to marry in the first place? Save for the laws restricting unmarried couples in certain situations, aren’t they just public announcements anyway? Couldn’t these laws be changed to fit our culture as we see fit and as we grow and change over the millennia?

This is a very important debate.   I feel homosexuals should have the right to adopt. Gays pose no threat to the life of a child. The couple are simply caring and raring the child up to be an adult. There are many heterosexual couples out there that adopt children but don't give the child the correct attention and proper upbringing it needs to be a good adult. But overall, I feel all couples willing to adopt a child ,regardless of their sexuality, should be intensively interviewed and have their backgrounds checked. We need the right caliber of couples to look after and rare the people of the future.

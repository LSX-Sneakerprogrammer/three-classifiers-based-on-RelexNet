It is not wrong to get "married." However, in that logic and mind, it is wrong to live in a perspective of not producing children when overpopulation isn't met. It is "naturally wrong" to have an infertile body when you can't produce an offspring...in one sense. In stated this sense in my first argument.   When i created my first argument, the thought of marriage didn't come to mind. I understand that is weird because that word is in the title of this debate. And i find it weird. I replied supportingly, but not one hundred percent supportingly, that men and women should be attracted to each other. I comment that i supported is that of Shadowwolf when he stated that men and women should fall in love. In response, ignorantly percieved that comment as that men and women should be attracted to one another.   I provided senses in which this attraction is right and wrong.  Edit. I now believe that my comment was a little off topic. When i think of marriage, i think of children. However, if the thought of children wasn't implied by the author, my comment should be dismissed.

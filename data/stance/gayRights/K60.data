ur catholic or what? A christian that dosent see a problem with Gay marriage is not christian. As homosexuality is against the bible's principles. I agreed with you until you started talking about how it hurts no one but stripping away rights. I agree with you hlf way..But the Bible says sin is detrimental to most evryone while sexual sins are sins against ones own body. do you believe in Sin? or are you one of those watered-down christians? I agree in speration of church and state, And that ppl should be able to make their own choices.. But seriously....

I've been tired of this long ago and can't be bothered to reply anymore.   Then why bother now? If only to have the last say.   You have no morals - because you're gay. OK you may have some morals but not when it comes to this.   Mate I am not Gay and I do have morals especially when it comes to this. Just because I agree with that Gay people should be allowed to marry does not make me Gay, I am married to a women are you?   Your ethics differ - because you think it's OK to be gay   Well, if this isn't stating the obvious.   It's disgusting   This is only to you.   You're not born gay   Yes you are, it is quite a detailed answer but if you would like I could go in to it.   It's wrong.   To you, this does not make it undeniably true.   You're gay. And a paedophile.   No I am not, are you trying to insult me, because coming from you after your tirade of bullshit it is not even in the slightest bit annoying.   Have fun watching 4year olds being raped by 60year olds.   It takes a sick mind to come up with this sort of scenario you may need help.  It is also quite telling of the validity of your arguement that you would drop so low to finish off.

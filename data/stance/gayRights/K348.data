Yes, gay marriege hurts everyone. Because the government is giving consent to homosexuality. Because most of our children go to puclic schools they are taught to trust Ceaser. They grow up thinking that the government is on their side and all policemen are nice and then they get jobs and taxes are cut from their check and they go "what?". But the point is that most Parents don't want their kids going to the mall and see mr and mr Smith. Its traumatic for a child to see two men or two women kissing. But when the government that hey've been told to blindly trust and pledge their alleagience to (bleh!!) sends teh message that this kind of behavior is normal then it creates a rift between the parents' raising of their child and the governments message.

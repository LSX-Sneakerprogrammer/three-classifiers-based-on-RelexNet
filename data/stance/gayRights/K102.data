Whatever Jake, it's very easy to lie and be a bigot and a fundie, especially over internet.  Approximately 80% of homophobes are gay and I'm SURE the rest have their issues too, mostly connected with sexuality.  If you think that a person would turn gay if he was allowed to, than you must be thinking of a person who is attracted to men, you are referring to a GAY person and a GAY person turning GAY ISN'T VERY DRAMATIC, NOW IS IT?!  An intelligent straight person would never like it to not allow gays to marry and adopt children.  If gays can marry and adopt that means that baby making isn't a very big deal since the gays are going to raise them. (If you are a religions fundie, that means you can be more logically for pro-life if you are pro-gay-marriage)  Plus, if there are so many women left alone, or rather lonely, than you can have a lot of sex.  Oh, and by the way, straight men like sex with women (right guys? :)), so they couldn't mind.  The only people who could POSSIBLY mind gays are gay people who don't want to be gay(...and raise kids and miss all the coitus..., but they don't like it anyway) and women who fall in love with gays. As some comedian woman says: "I'm a fag-hag, but now I think about my wishing in youth about being surrounded by handsome men, I should have been more specific."

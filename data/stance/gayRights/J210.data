My question is how old are you? Do you know what can screw up a kid Kuklapolitan? You cannot judge others by age. You could be in your forties and never have raised a kid in your life. I on the other hand have had alot of experience with children and gay parents and I am in my twenties. I could be well more knowledgable about this topic then you.

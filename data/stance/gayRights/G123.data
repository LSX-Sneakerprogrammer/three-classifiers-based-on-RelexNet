The difference between getting the wrong drink and allowing gays to marry is that getting the wrong drink has a direct negative impact on your life. Allowing gays to marry doesn't affect you in any negative way.  Even if you think gay marriage  does  harm you in some way, weigh that harm against the harm of infringing upon the liberty of a large number of honest Americans. It seems clear to me that the latter is worse.   "my goal is to watch them eventually find a suitable partner, love each other forever and bear me grandchildren"   They can still do that. Allowing gays to marry doesn't impede straight marriage in any way.

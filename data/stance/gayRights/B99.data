The dictionary isn't always right. The dictionary is written by a bunch of people that give the definition of words as they see it   And religious scripture is written by God, right?   Go to a country with morals and you'll see that marriage is between man and wife and that it is a religious ceremony.   I feel your idea of morality is twisted, please name a country with morals or one without for that fact.   You cannot have a man and man or woman and woman or transexual and transexual   Why exactly can you not have these?   or brother and sister or brother and father or brother and mother or sister and father or sister and mother or sister and sister or brother and brother   By law siblings can not marry each other, this not the same as Homosexuality, incestuous behavior can create seriously deficient children therefore there is still a victim. Also there is not many siblings or parents of children wanting to marry each other, I am sure that there is very little people actually attracted to their siblings or parents, and should bare no mention in a debate on the right of two consenting adults to spend their lives together. Plus this is not the subject being debated.   or pedophile and young person or dead body and necrophile or a dog and a bestiality person.   Again victims involved so immoral.   Lol you being serious?   Was it not you that was harping on about the fact that Christianity and Islam are the only religions discussed/ considered in these debates, in an argument with me recently.  Buddism is not against homosexuality, Neither is Hinduism Shinto does not outline any problems with it. And as for immoral it is only in the eyes of those too consumed in their own shit to ever empathize with another human.   Blah blah blah anybody that isn't accepting of all types of peoples is a bigot. Have fun advocating paedophilia.      The term bigot is ambiguous it can also mean one that is strongly partial to ones own group, etc, etc. Why would I advocate paedophillia, it wrong and immoral, Now, empathizing with a pedophile is something I could do, something I see from your post you will never do or be able to do.   I'm not going to bother claling you a sick fuck cause I think all of you guys know you are...  I need to come up with a new accurate word to describe you queers.  Ohhhh, touchy, your name calling is sooooooooooo hurtful I think I might cry.  Explain to me why you brand me a queer? or a sick fuck?    This is where it might hurt your head   My head was OK, but thanks for the warning, your logical deduction is unique to say the least.

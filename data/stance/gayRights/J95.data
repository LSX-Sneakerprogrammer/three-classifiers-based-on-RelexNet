I do believe that gays should adopt children. In my life I've seen children and teens be much better adjusted because they've had to go through not only the normal chaos of childhood with other children calling names and being mean but they've also had to go through what I might call an orientation that very few kids have...and that is that prejudice, hatred and a lack of understanding for the human condition so thoroughly exists in this world. I've seen them build both strength and character through their upbringing.  I tell you what I've experienced personally and do not resort to the "fact" sheets. The facts are not in yet to any great degree in either direction. In 5-10 years we will have a greater amount of statistics to go by.

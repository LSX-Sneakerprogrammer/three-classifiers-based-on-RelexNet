Guess what? Marriage is a "civil union".   In order to get married, you need a license from a government office. You can't get it from a religious organization. That makes marriage a civil matter.  The meaning of "civil" in this situation is "of or pertaining to civil law". Civil law is "the body of laws of a state or nation regulating ordinary private matters, as distinct from laws regulating criminal, political, or military matters."  One definition of "union" is "the act of uniting or an instance of being united in marriage". As I said, marriage is a civil union.   So people who want gays to be able to form civil unions are in effect supporting gay marriage.  However same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships in the U.S. do not have 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.   When African Americans turned to the courts to help protect their constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of any kind deprived African Americans of equal protection. Gay Americans also want the same rights, benefits and protections provided to all other Americans.  Denying gay partners the full benfits otherwise granted to same sex partners is saying that gay individuals and same-sex couples are “second-class citizens” who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, heterosexual individuals or opposite-sex couples.  On this basis, several state courts have decided it was illegal to deny same sex couples the right to marry. So, the question is not "should Gay marrige be legal in the United State of America?" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in an illegal way toward same sex couples. Obviously, the answer is "No".

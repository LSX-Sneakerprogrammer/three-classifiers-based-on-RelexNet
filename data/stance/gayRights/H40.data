1. The foolish "meat is murder crowd, who probably are agreeing with you.   2. Eating steak isn't morally wrong, so that's not a very good example.   3. I agree that doesn't apply.    "Obviously I am not accusing you of lynching black people, or using terrorism"   So why use the KKK!? [other than to gain support and try to make me look bad] There are plenty of other  good  people who don't support gay marriage.    "your problem"   lol   "Trust me Jake I know. Gays are considered icky. "Dude, don't be gay" or "what are you a faggot?" are common because being homosexual is socially unacceptable among many people."   Who are you quoting? You choose to make crap up that idiots have probably said instead of giving an actual quote from a smart person that is against gay marriage. ooo! That way, maybe you can stereotype all of us into being idiots. You're so smooth. Nobody saw through that.    "make fun of them"   Once again, who are you talking about!?   It's so obvious what you are trying and failing to do.    "However, unless you can differentiate between these actions and homosexuality then you are merely cherrypicking from the Bible what you want to believe."   If you read the bible instead of cherrypicking quotes out of the book out of context then we can talk. Or you could just watch the west wing.   There is a lot of symbolism in the bible that you would not understand.   "So now, Jake, I must ask you for what is probably the twentieth time: what makes homosexuality immoral?"   I believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman, anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred.   I don't make fun of gay people, I don't hate gay people. I would ask you to do the same for me, oh passionate one.    "I look forward to your response."   What a cocky thing to say. Or where you trying to be cocky? Is that what's hip now? Is it cool to call yourself a sarcastic dick?   Kids today.

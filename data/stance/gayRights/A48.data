I guess i am treating it as a joke a little as i think about it. But not entirely.   No matter how little or how much, you are still guilty.   I am not putting words in your mouth.   Yes you are. I repeat, "I have never argued based on emotion." Get that through to your thick skull, idiot, and then come and rebut me.   Yeah i agree. There is no difference between the two in Physics either.   But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   Look. I can easily start a society with mostly female homosexuals. I can start one as a simple college experiment. That is all what im saying. And eventually, the society will fail.   I won't respond because you haven't answered my criticism that your statement was begging the question.   Well, i don't need to give evidence if a society can compose itself with mostly female homosexuals.   You really enjoy putting words in others' mouths, don't you? I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the  need  for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.   Like this one other debator, i am simply proposing variables.   There is no problem with proposing variables  as long as you can JUSTIFY the need for proposing the variables . If you can't, you'll just be violating Occam's razor.   No children is ever going to be produced.   Really?   If i killed a rapist, in one view the death is a good thing because the rapist isn't going to harm anyone anymore.   No, it is never a good thing to kill anyone, even if that person is a rapist. In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I can't prove morality but morality exists.   If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart.   And morality forbids you from killing your own kind: humans in this case.   My morality even forbids me from killing species of animals  other than my own kind .   Everybody can be right and wrong at the same time.   No, they can't. That is still a contradiction.   you still question to say that my words are irrelevant to the debate   I said "irrelevant to the debate", not "irrelevant to our discussion". Learn to read will you, idiot?   So really, i didn't mean to disrespect you. Im simply stating the truth i perceive.   These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Then why did you "argued" that i treated your criticism as a joke because i laughed.    That is  not  an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, "Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad." Such an argument is fallacious.

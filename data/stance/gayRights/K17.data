First off sharpiron, I don't have anything against you as a person. But have you looked at the world lately, it is already to the point that sexual deviants thrive in this world. That isn't gay peoples fault. The fact that molestation, insert, rape and child pornography and adultery happen is proof of that. Very few are ever held accountable for their actions. Politicians are caught doing it all the time, and its passed off as a "simple mistake". Especially if it is a heterosexual act.   The act of allowing two men or two women to marry does not hurt anyone or even family values, because we just want the same thing straight people already have and take for granted. Acceptance in this world to be able to love whom we want to love. Monogamous, loving relationships with someone of the same gender. We want families and children and the love and respect and adoration from someone who pledges their life to us as we pledge our life to them.   I was raised in a loving Christian home, my grandmother was my preacher until I was 30. I love God and always have even from the time I was a small child. I was raised to believe that all homosexuals were going to hell and that the only cure was a good woman. So at the age of 20 I married. I cried and prayed many nights for God to make the thought of a man be repulsive to me and after 11 years of marriage I finally realized I was gay and had been all along. My feelings for men had been with me since I was young, the first memory I have was at the age of 11. I so desperately wanted to fit in, to be accepted by my family, to go to Heaven. It took me 19 years to realize that I am still God's child and he loves me, even as a gay man. It was definitely hard to understand after years of being told how horrible and wrong all gay people were, only to realize I had been trying to be something I wasn't and it was slowly killing me from the inside out. Many times I just prayed for God to kill me. But it never came. Once I finally accepted who I was, who I had always been, God gave me the peace I needed.  My own mother stated she wished she had never had me and most of my blood relatives have nothing to do with me. You know the scripture that says to not be unequally yoked, well apparently my love for God wasn't enough. I was escorted from my church and told not to come back until I was ready to renounce my sexuality and come back to the fold. I don't blame God for what others do in his name. I am sad that my family isn't judgement free like they claim to be. I am sad that they will never know the man I love and have loved faithfully for over two years. I plan to marry him, with or without a marriage certificate. The way I see it, Adam and Eve didn't need a piece of paper to be married, and neither do I. Marriage is a state of mind and a way of life. Even the most married people fall into infidelity because the words they spake didn't mean anything. So gay or straight if your heart isn't in it, is it really a marriage.   I wish everyone would just worry about themselves and recognize the hurt they cause by telling others to do as they say and not what they do. I hope everyone out there that may read this can get the sense that I am Gay, I am in a loving relationship with a man, I am a God fearing and God loving man. And God loves me for who I am, not what the world thinks I should be.

I think they should be able to adopt and/or have surrogates, homosexual people should not be denied the rights that the heterosexuals receive, and they should be allowed to experience a child loving them as a parent like the rest of us....I speak for both communities as I am Bisexual.. our hearts are created equal as well as god created us. We love with every fiber of our being and wish the rest of the world would open they're hearts, eyes and minds to the point we are just like you we just are attracted to the same sex!

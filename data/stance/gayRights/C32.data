minorities become majorities in large part by persuasion - so people should definitely try to convince people with different beliefs. it doesn't give the other side any power it doesn't already have, etc. Making cogent arguments may not convince people who are entrenched in their opinion, but can garner those who are on the fence, or those that weigh the fundamental value behind your argument more than the value behind theirs (e.g. those that disagree with gay marriage, but think the government should not be the arbiter of which marriages are good ones), and people who don't know much about the issue at all.

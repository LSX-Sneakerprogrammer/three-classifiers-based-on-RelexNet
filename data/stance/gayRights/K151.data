andSoccer16,  First of all. I would like to say that you have challenged me and bested me and I have acknolwedged it and up voted you for it. If you're truly a teen, then you're light years ahead from when I was a teen because it has taken me this long to get to this stage. It may have been a backwards journey for me but I like to think otherwise.  Your question was an interesting challenge to say the least. I wrestled with it until my wife got home and helped me see the light. She helped me see what I've been feeling but unable to put into words.  Please bear with me, I'm a little drunk. Which is not entirely fair because you are not allowed to drink and probably in your prime.  A non- religious reason why people are opposed to same sex marriage (by J.C.)  Birds of a feather flock together.  I wish I could make my argument more...... serious.... more..... adult like. It's just human nature.  Here read this:   http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/ mar/09/genetics.medicalresearch    and this:   http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/ 28/5/283    and this:   http://milehive.com/ index.php?option=com_ content&task;=view&id;=1176&Itemid;=36    The bottom line:  Gays want to be accepted into a club that doesn't want them and they are getting militant about it.  Why is that? Probably because people want what they can't have and despise what they do have. Groucho Marx once said:  "PLEASE ACCEPT MY RESIGNATION. I DON'T WANT TO BELONG TO ANY CLUB THAT WILL ACCEPT PEOPLE LIKE ME AS A MEMBER".   This is also why the "hair" industry makes lots of money. Women with straight hair want curly hair and women with curly hair want staight hair.  It's just human nature. Not bigotry or ignorance, it's just human nature.  Now, I have to go pee.  C-ya ;)

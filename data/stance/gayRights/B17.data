From a functonal perspective, sex is designed for procreation to ensure the survival of a species. However, in contemporary society, sex is also a form of pleasure. A human being's mind is very complex capable of everything from philosophical thought to emotional depth beyond that of mere animals. Pleasure/happiness helps keep us sane. The same way fear helps keep people alive. Regardless whether your Vulcanian logic find emotions to be "illogical," the point is they exist. Their presence is not accidental. The logic is we should pass laws that make society happy while not infringing on the rights of others. Not create laws that would make sense in a world that doesn't exist: an emotionless species with a population problem. However, the issue isn't about legalizing gay sex. The issue is gay  marriage.   Marriage  on the other hand is a legal contract between two people asking society to recognize them as a family unit conferred with certain rights (health administrative proxies, administration of estates, etc...) How consenting adults choose to have sex should have nothing to do with denying them rights. Furthermore, a law prohibiting gay marriage isn't grounded in logic rather religious dogma. Archaic laws grounded in religious dogma should not be dictating rights in a secular society.   Only 27% of teenage females who engage in coitus do so with their partner wearing a condom.   My ultimate point here is that claiming Homosexuality results in the spread of disease is irrelevant to the argument because so does heterosexuality when done without protection.

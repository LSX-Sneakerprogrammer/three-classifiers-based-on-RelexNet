Men should fall in love with women   Says who?!   that's why they where created   They were not "created." They evolved into existence over billions of years.   And you are telling them what their purpose in life is. Your view is irrelevant to what they believe their purpose is.   women should get married to men because it makes ever ting easier.   How exactly does prohibiting someone from marrying who they love because some idiot says they shouldn't "make ever ting easier?"  That is absolutely absurd.  I will not tolerate any attempt to forcibly take someone's rights because a f@#$in' 2000-year-old book says they should be killed. Who are your to dictate who one can and cannot love?

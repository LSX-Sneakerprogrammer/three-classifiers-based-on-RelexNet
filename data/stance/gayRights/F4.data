So you meet a guy, you like him, then.... you get married and hope love follows? Or you love first and then decide to marry? The first way sounds silly, maybe that's just me though. And the second one involves love without marriage.  You seem to be assuming that every homosexual agrees with this point. Maybe they have good reasons and in fact do want to. You have no right to say what everyone else should want.  Now you have provided a little justification, which I agree with.

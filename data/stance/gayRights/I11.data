"Ok now, and read my whole argument and read it twice befroe you comment; gay, CHRISTIAN marriages should not be allowed."  okay so now instead of illegalizing homosexual marriage, you want to ban homosexuals from christianity? XD wow, the problem with this is that there isn't only one interpretation of christianity, and there are many interpretations of christian that accept homosexuality.  "By bringing this issue to the courts, the homosexual community is forcing a rule onto a private group!"  what rule are they forcing? really all they are doing is taking a rule down, not putting any new ones up. allowing gay people to marry in now way affects anyone else other than gay people.

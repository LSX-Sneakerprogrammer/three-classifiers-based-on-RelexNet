I think that everyone should be given the chance to care for a child. And it all depends how you best give the proper guidance and love for your children. But I am not still favor of gays adopting a child. Child should be well-guided and be nurture and I believe that only a legitimate couple complete with a mom and dad could only provide this. There are studies that children with no father image at home tend to engage more into drugs and other things. This is also the same case if mom is not around. I believe this could be worsen if you are reared by parents who has the same gender.

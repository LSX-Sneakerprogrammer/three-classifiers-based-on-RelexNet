Oh there it is again, that arbitrary standard of consent.   It's not that arbitrary, since consent is already defined in law. And the very basic requirement of a marriage is that there are at least two consenting parties involved.   If I could demonstrate that my cat loves me it could be proven that on some level the cat consents because it doesn't run away when I show it love, therefore, we should get married.   Well, homosexuals can make that claim (though I'm absolutely positive that you're oversimplifying their case) because the issue of consent is both de facto and de jure. It's already assumed as a matter of ritual and law. Showing that you love each other is one thing, but not running away is not a form of legitimate consent, since consent is not a passive action, but an active one. It requires that there is a fulfilling of some verbal criteria, whether written or spoken, and it has to be initiated within the strictures of the ritual.   If love and consent equals marriage all I have to do is demonstrate that my relationships posses those two qualities and I should be able to marry the object of my affection.   There are a lot of "ifs" in your argument. But you're also skewing the legal definition of "consent" to make a weak point. Within the strictures of marriage, express consent is required. This means that a personhood of adequate intelligence can make a reasoned decision in response to the prompting or initiations of another and  come to accord  with said proposal. Your cat can't do that. Now, if you're actually willing to take the time to demonstrate that your cat is capable of such faculties, then you have a case. Until then, you're blowing hot air.   To oppose me you would have to invoke another standard.   No. I don't.

Apparently you didn't read the included link.  The text of the Full Faith and Credit Clause:   "Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof"   Not only does it generally just mean that a state will recognize the acts of another state not enforce the other state's laws within its borders. It also says specifically that Congress can determine the effect thereof, as they have done with DOMA.  If my state says I can't buy alcohol on Sunday and I drive across the border does the other state have to not sell me alcohol?

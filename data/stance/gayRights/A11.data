I believe that they should be able to because it is their right. Just like we have the right to marry one another they should be able to. How about this put yourself in their shoes how would you like it if you were in love with the same sex and you 2 decide to get married but you couldn't then what? You would be pretty mad wouldn't you? I know that I would. So to me I think they should be able to get married. That's just the way that I see things though.

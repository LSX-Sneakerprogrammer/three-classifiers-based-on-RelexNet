It was neither an opinion nor a supposition. It is not what sex 'ought' to be, but rather what it is.  Sex is an activity performed for the purpose of procreating the species.   Sex is an activity performed for pleasure.  Sex is an activity performed for social bonding.  Sex is an activity used to manipulate and display power over another.  Sex is an activity used for procreation.  Sex is an activity that releases tensions.  This is a non-comprehensive list of what sex is.  Marriage is a social contract.  Marriage is a means of supporting a family.  Marriage is a means of establishing or supporting a dynasty.  Marriage is the acquisition of property (the female).  Marriage is the dividing of resources and income.  Marriage is hoped to be a lifelong commitment.  Amongst other things.  Your choice of which of these premises to select, and base a "logical" conclusion upon is subjective. Your conclusion is erroneous anyway because marriage isn't only about procreation, and in fact only happenstance to procreation in a number of cases since procreation will occur out of wedlock.

No, i don't treat your criticism as a joke. I never did. And thus, you are judging me wrong.   So why did you add "lol" in front of an already illogical comment?   Wasn't you that said that emotion can't be used as a logical argument? It was you.   I have never argued based on emotion. You're putting words in my mouth again.   "Ok. I see that im a little wron. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created."   In epistemology, there is no difference between the discovery of knowledge and the creation of knowledge.   I implied normal as the "carrying capacity."   Which is a completely fallacious implication. The term "carrying capacity" does  not  imply "normal" at all. It is a technical term in Geography which refers to "the idea that any given environment can only support a finite population."   A created scenario is only pointless if it can't happen. My scenario of a society with mostly female homosexuals can happen because i can easily create one.   This is question begging. You are arguing in a circle.   A society with mostly female homosexuals is not reasonable   It is not reasonable because you haven't given the evidence for assuming that a society is composed of or can compose of mostly female homosexuals.   You just admitted that that scenario do have a point in proving that homosexuality is wrong.   No, I didn't. The only reason why you say so is because you an obstinate fool.   But we are on another indepth discussion if homosexuality is right and wrong.   Which is irrelevant to the debate at hand.   But i insisted to carry on this disccussion because you are wrong about my claim that homosexuals can be wrong and right.   You  are  wrong. Something cannot be both "right" and "wrong" at the same time. That is a contradiction.   This proves that you are thick headed. And i don't mean to disrespect you.   Hey idiot, you  did  mean to disrespect me. And by the way, you are thick headed. And I mean that with the utmost disrespect to you.

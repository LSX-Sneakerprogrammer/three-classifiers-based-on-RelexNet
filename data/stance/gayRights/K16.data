Okay good Chad, let us apply this definition to my previous contentious argument with you. I argued that anal sex and also using a plastic/wooden/steel rod in a sexual act are irrational. Further Chad, when we are aroused, our body reacts by producing lubrication in preparation for intercourse. Therefore using other body parts in sexual acts are irrational, don't you think? Morality constrains us, it qualifies right and wrong, it not alien to us it's built-in, coded, programming into our humanity. The concept of the original position is based upon this inalienable human trait. Moralism (which we both obviously hate) is a bully, it attempts to devour and threaten others. Therefore don't confuse morality which is innate with the hypocritical self-promoting moralism. In addition Chad, my view is in the minority now, because of the shifting goal post, look at the Argument Ratio or the Debate info above.

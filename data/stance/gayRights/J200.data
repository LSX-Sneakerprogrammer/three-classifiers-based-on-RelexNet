1. I'm pretty sure nature,  not  God,  did  intend for parents to be heterosexual couples. Why else would we reproduce sexually? A mother and a father can make a baby, and thus a mother and father are more equipped to raise a child.  2. True, unnatural doesn't mean  bad . But does it necessarily mean good?  3. You have no right to tell me to denounce my religion. I happen to love my religion and just because you don't believe in a higher being does not mean the whole world must think like you.

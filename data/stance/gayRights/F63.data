Actually at this rate earth will be overpopulated anyway. So the more gay men and women the merrier (no pun intended) and as for "no more babies." just because you allow some gay men and women to marry doesn't mean every man and women on the planet will want to fuck the same sex. I'm completely FOR gay marriage but I don't feel the urge to go marry another dude. your argument sounds like that of an 8 year old.

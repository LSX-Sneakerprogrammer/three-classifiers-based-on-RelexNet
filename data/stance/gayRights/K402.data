You don't really address any of my questions, Jake. I counter your debate and then you ignore the point and go off on a tangent.   So you say that parents are legally married... ok, so if there is a divorce those people are no longer parents? If there is a death of a parent? You are defining a family in a very narrow sense. Gay sex partners are not what we are talking about here, but gay "people who actually love each other and their children and who stay together."

"What right do you have to force your religious views on people who do not share your faith?"   What right do gay people have to force their views on everyone els?  I never said I had that right I said that as an american I have the right to vote and express my opinion. You don't like my opinion?, good I don't really care.    "P.S. Show me where in the Constitution it defines a family as a man and a woman."   Show me where I said that.  Or did you just make that up?

Prove that homosexuality is natural.   Scientific observation. Watch the video.   There is no logical reason to pain pictures - in a way, there is. It shows future generations what the world looks (or rather, looked) like, primarily before the advent of the camera.   Yet you dodge "dancing."   Pleasure is illogical. Enjoyment is illogical.   Then happiness, anger, sadness, etc... are all illogical as well. It would be logical for someone to do something that is pleasurable become it makes them happy. If you think happniess is "illogical," then I would have to question your sanity. The only people I'm aware of that find emotions "illogical" are psychopaths.   How are human rights pleasurable?   Hmmm...talk to a Holocaust survivor or a minority during the 1960s. They might be able to give you a reason why having human rights is pleasurable.

Thank you Kroticfate for coming clean and admitting that what you did was wrong. I'll try and post that for you on the FATE or KROTICFATE debate since we're having computer problem on the site right now. I am proud you did this and I think others will give you the second chance you deserve, as I will. I will now gladly add you to my ally list for being courageous enough to tell us and make it right.

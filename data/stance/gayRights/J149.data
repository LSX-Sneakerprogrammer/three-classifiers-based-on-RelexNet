Exactly! I am not really against gay marriage or gay rights. However, I am glad I finally found a post that I totally agree with. Some kids are born gay, but most are born straight. So unless the same-sex parents are raising gay children, I do believe it is a little selfish to put the kids in that environment. With that said, I didn't grow up in an orphanage, so it is tough to be entirely sure on a position without some doubt...

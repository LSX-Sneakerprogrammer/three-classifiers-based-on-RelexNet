" at least I can back up my beliefs."   revelation from God vs a television show. Hmmm. I chose not to watch that video because I have already seen it. Do you really think that I take everything from the bible literally and blindly? Because if you do then you are a fool.   Do you know where those quotes are from Exactly? I would like to know what books they are from within the bible, and what the situation was. Looks like you blindly took those to garner support.    Then why should a lesbian be forced to marry a man?    Haha  really!?  I don't remember saying anything about forcing marriage on people. Do you?   Your definition of family is equally bullshit.    Oh really? How so exactly?  Once again  Arrogant.   I want to tell me exactly what law my church made against black people? Or wanted to make.   Once again I am not a fool and I am not denying people rights.   Now lets take the religion out of this, why should we change the definition of marriage for a select few?  Give me a reason why homosexuals should raise children. And I'm tired of hearing about that friend of yours, give me an actual reason. You are the one who wants change you should have to answer my question first.   I doubt you will so just go watch the west wing and be a little follower of the media.

I believe Gay's should be able to marry I'm not gay... However I have a guy that I've been with for over 2 yrs that I would do or give anything for. I see that as an example... if someone were to tell me that this man I spend my time with everyday and plan to raise a family with in the future was illegal... I would riot honestly if any GOOD human being knows what its like to absolutely love someone, then you also know what its like to imagine them being torn away from your arms and how much it hurts.  If honestly you can't let two people love one another then what gives YOU the right to even love someone?!  I don't want to hear the "Well it says in the bible!..." No... shut up just stop right there because I've read the bible and I've read the commandments NOT one single time did it mention that two people of the same sex could not love one another! If you think its the work of the devil then SHAME SHAME SHAME... on you. Because I do know that in the bible it DOES state as a commandment even... THOU SHALL NOT JUDGE! If that's all you can do with your life is tell someone they don't have the right to love then it is you that will judged by god himself and if you don't believe in god. Then I'm sorry you have nothing to believe in but picking on others to make your life complete only makes you lower then the dirt on the ground.

The clause does not require that one state must adopt the laws of another.   That is exactly what I am saying.   Not when the 'effect' amounts to overturning the clause itself   You aren't making any sense - Congress determining the effect of a marriage law from one state on another is overturning the state law in this instance not overturning the FFC clause.  You began by saying that the reason custody rights would not be in question is because of the FFC clause, now you agree that a law in one state (e.g. marriage and it's corresponding custody rights/obligations) would not need to be enforced in another state - which is correct and what I have been saying. A state would just say yep we recognize you got married in another state, but that means nothing here.  from DOMA:  "No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship." - this is Congress' determination of the effect of marriage laws in one state on another. The FFC clause gives them the power to make this determination (though it likely violates the Equal Protection clause which is what it is actually being challenged on and Loving v Virginia was overturned on.)

I agree with HGrey's point here about the subjectivity of gender. I do not think there are specific things that can be "taught" through ONLY one gender. However, I do think having a parent of that gender helps; a daughter would want to talk to her mother about her period, if given the choice. But fathers can definitely talk about it as well (even though it might be a bit uncomfortable).  To quickly state my piece:  Yes, I believe gay parents should be able to adopt. I do not think a child  needs  a mother and father to get a healthy perspective on things. I found an old article about this issue a while ago:    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/ 26florida.html    It was about the Florida ban on gay adoption that was ruled unconstitutional (but you can see that from the title).  I even found an older article about a "new take" on the American family:  http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/25/ gay.adoption/index.html    By doing a quick google search, you can see that it is not on the forefront of the political crossfire as gay marriage is, but it is a important issue. I think one of the main reasons it makes people so uncomfortable is that everyone feels like they know how to rear children the best, whether it is with homosexual parents, hetoersexual parents, single parents, or whatever. It is a touchy issue for most people, since everyone has to listen to their mother-in-laws bicker once and a while.  I'm interested to hear more from the anti-gay adoption side. This debate is open to all.

I like how you attack my unfounded statement by making an unfounded statement of your own.  Anyway, I looked it up and it seems nature and nuture both play a role:  "There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation."   http://www.apa.org/topics/ sorientation.html

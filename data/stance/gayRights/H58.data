This is a highly bigoted opinion. Making a case against gay marriage on god alone is a weak position. In what way does the people on the other side being gay somehow devalue their opinions?   If I'm gay, does my opinion somehow mean less than yours?   Gay people don't harm other people. To deprive them of their right to marry the person they love who happens to be the same sex, is wrong.   This is a completely black and white issue, no gray area whatsoever. Homosexual couples are being deprived the right to marriage as well as all the legal benefits that come along with marriage. This is a civil rights issue.

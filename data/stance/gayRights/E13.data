I can not decide for myself, I FOR or AGAINST ...  On the one hand, if the child is taken from an orphanage ... can he better still be in the family than there ...  On the other hand ... will grow if they are "normal" child? normal in terms of sexual orientation ... (although, of course, the word "normal" probably not very correct)  Respect family values ​​... I believe in the value of such families are not lost, there are the same values ​​as in ordinary families.

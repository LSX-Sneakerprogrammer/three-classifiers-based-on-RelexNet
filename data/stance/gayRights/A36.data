It can. I did proved it. And i will prove it again.   It can't. You won't be able to prove it because I will tear down your proof again and again.   Belief may be truth or may be not truth, backed with no strong evidence to support it.   You  still  don't get it. You can't make a valued judgement on whether something is true or not if you have no evidence. Tell me how else do you want me to make it simpler for you? I have already given you a substantial analogy and yet you seem to thick to understand such a simple concept.   I believe in God but that isn't knowledge.   Exactly. So don't try to claim that it is knowledge.   But im frustrated why would you discuss this again when i had proven with examples that my belief is somewhat knowledgable. I gave examples.   Are you that stupid? Believe is  never  knowledge. And therefore, your examples are cases of false analogies.   lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    WRONG . Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area. I'm a Geography scholar, see. So don't try and pull any stunts with Geographical terminology with me ;)   t relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life.   Which is a contradiction. Gosh, you're really not that intelligent are you?   If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only  female  homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.   Response to premise 1 :  First, why does it have to be only  female  homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing "society" and "population". According to the OED, "society" refers to "Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship." On the other hand, "population" refers to "A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it." So, while homosexuality might not increase the  population size , this has no bearing on whether  society  will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Response to premise 2 :  It is a hasty generalisation to say that  all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   I have no quarrel with your argument here except for the last part. There is no conclusive evidence to show that with homosexuality, overpopulation will not occur. As I have shown, your definition of overpopulation is flawed. Again I repeat, I am well learned in Geography and demography, so don't fuck around with definitions and pretend to be knowledgeable in front of me. We can have homosexuality, but if each couple still gives birth to 20 children, overpopulation  might  still occur. Furthermore, it  DOES NOT  mean that if we allow homosexuals to marry, then everyone will turn homosexual. There still  will  be heterosexuals and in fact, there won't be any change as to the number of heterosexuals since homosexuals will probably not marry someone of the opposite gender anyway.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both "right" AND "wrong" at the same time.   I have shown that both your arguments are fallacious. You are wrong on both arguments at the same time.   If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment.   You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of  most  of the suffering of the Jewish people?   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person.   A rapist cannot  try  to rape a person. He has  already  rape d  a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   However, i am also right for saving a life.   Committing murder is  not  a characteristic of rapists.   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the "one child policy."   The One Child policy was introduced due to an abnormally high rate of population growth after the era of Mao Zedong, who preached that with more people there will be greater economic progress. The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it  might  or might  not  be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China  relative  to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities.   Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples.   Wrong. That is only after the revision of the Policy. The original policy only said all couples were allowed to have one child. Did you know that there were on average 33  forced  abortions a day at the peak of the enforcement of the One Child policy? Please don't talk about things you don't know. You'll only make a fool of yourself.

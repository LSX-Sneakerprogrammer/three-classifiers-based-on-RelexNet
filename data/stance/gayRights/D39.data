If you allow marriage between anyone other than one man and one woman....then you must allow marriage between anything, especially groups of people.   It is not true that it   must   follow. In fact, the list of countries that recognize same-sex marriages and civil unions is nearly 100% exclusionary with the list of countries that allow polygamy.  More than 30 countries allow same-sex marriage or civil unions, and only one of those (South Africa) also allows polygamy.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Same-sex_marriage     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Legal_status_of_polygamy

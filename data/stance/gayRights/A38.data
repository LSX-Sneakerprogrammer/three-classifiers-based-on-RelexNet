Why am i wrong when i said that belief may be truth or may not be truth backed with no strong evidence to support it? Knowledge is knowledge whether or not if it backed up with evidence or not.   This is  EXACTLY  where you are wrong. Are you so dense and stupid that you can't understand simple English? If you can't, then it would be beneath me to honour you with a reply, which I have been doing for a long time and my patience is wearing thin. Knowledge is what philosophers term as  "justified true belief" . What this means is that to be considered "knowledge", a belief must be  both  justified and true. If you can't understand this, then you are truly stupid.   Believing is an act and knowledge is a fact.   Wrong. See above.   How was i wrong when i stated "too much people to carry?"   You're wrong. "Too many" with respect to what? Be specific.   Or when i stated when "the amount of people exceed the normal amount?"   What is the "normal"? Be specific.   I should be been more specific but i know im right with the term overpopulation.   As long as you are not specific, you are wrong with the definition. That is the idea of "defining".   Don't question my scenario. That doesn't matter.   Contrary to your warped  belief , it is reasonable for me to question your scenario. In a debate, if the other side proposes a fallacious example, one is rightfully able to question the scenario. Learn how to debate and stop whining.   it is mostly female homosexuals.   First, that is  not  what you have said. Second, prove that it is " mostly  female homosexuals"? Finally,  so what  if it is mostly females? Until and unless you can give good reasons to counter  all  three questions I have asked, the best position here is that your example is warped.   However, without people, there isn't a society in existence.   This debate isn't about  propogating  homosexuality, it  is  about acceptance. I am not saying that homosexuality should be promoted. What I am saying is that they should be accepted. Your argument and implication that allowing homosexuals to marrying will inevitably lead to extinction is (a) unjustified and (b) a slippery slope argument.   Society cannot grow independently of population.   Yes it can. The eskimos have a rich society and culture, but you don't see them blooming in size, do you?   There is evidence that supports it. One evidence is imperialism.   What you said is that   " all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow"  . Imperialism only occurs with  some societies ,  NOT  all societies.   An entire history book is filled with desires of people to grow and succeed.   Yes, but not "conquer and grow".   And i too think a society can grow with homosexuality.   Which is contradictory to what you have said.   lol i researched on google definitions that states that a society is basically a community of people living in a region under law.   Just to side track, I think my definition from the OED is more credible than any definition from the Internet ;)   You didn't prove that my both scenarios are untrue.   I did. Until you reply my criticisms, I will not honour you with a rebuttal.

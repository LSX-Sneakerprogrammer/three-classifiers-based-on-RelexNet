What? So are you just admitting to talking out of your ass? Yes, if you espouse a belief I will believe that you believe it as a general courtesy of not thinking you a constant liar. If no one can believe your words at face value then there is no point ever debating you again as you just outed yourself as a nihilist, one who believes in nothing. Saying you think it's wrong for children to think being gay is ok says a lot about you. If you don't believe that then be more clear in your posts, because you seem constantly out of your depth on this site my friend.

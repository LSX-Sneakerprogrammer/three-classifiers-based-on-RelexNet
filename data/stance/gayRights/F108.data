What are friends for? Not that kind of relationship. If I am attracted to a female then I can't help it. And I don't think friends are meant for that intimacy.  Same-sex isn't for marriage because people can't get over themselves. If people want to live together in love than no one else should be able to stop them. Regardless of color, sex, or any other factor that people can't control.

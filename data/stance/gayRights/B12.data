Then I pity you.   Emotional sentiment is overrated.   Emotions are not illogical to those that have them   They matter to those who have them, but they often blind their judgment.   Rights are natural.   Rights are a human construct, and thus are unnatural.   Your Hobbesian   Hobbes? Was he the writer of Leviathon?   quickly leads to chaos and warfare.    Was the chaos and warfare of the middle ages caused by a lack of human rights? Or rather by overbearing monarchs?   Laws exist to promote peace and order.   How does homosexuality promote peace and order? Greece, Rome - all the homosexual 'hotspots' throughout history have fallen.

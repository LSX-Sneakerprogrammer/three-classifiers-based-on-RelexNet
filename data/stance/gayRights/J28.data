Yes Pineapple, listen to the 17 year old who lives with his parents about what is childish.   ""we live in a country of religious freedom... where religion has the freedom to oppress."  FALSE  Now you are blaming America. Well I'm on Americas side. You should be more grateful to live in this country."   Remember the  pyramid  that you so arrogantly showed Pineapple the other day?  Well you just resorted to contradiction, responding to tone, and ad hominem.  You said "FALSE" without providing evidence.  You criticized Pineapple for "blaming America" without providing evidence for the actual argument.  You then criticized Pineapple herself telling her to be more grateful, while once again failing to argue the actual point.  Irony sure is a fickle mistress.  Furthermore she is on America's side too, which is why when she sees a problem with the country she brings it up. Criticizing the country for it's wrongdoings is the most patriotic thing you can do.

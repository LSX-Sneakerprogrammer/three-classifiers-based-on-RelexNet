I think you missed the point. What I am trying to say is that humans, by nature, are always willing to take certain issues to see how far they can take, sometimes even if they truly do not believe it. To make things even worse, some will do it just to show that they are not considered out of today's norm. History teaches us that and history always repeats itself, unfortunately. The consent will have absolutely nothing to do with.  I am more than secure with myself so you have to come up with another excuse.

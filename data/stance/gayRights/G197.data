first of all, your enlglish is horrible my friend, i can hardly understand what you are saying. and secondly, some people are born gay and can't help the way they feel. god created people so technically he also created gays. besides, where in the bible does it specifically state that gays shouldn't marry? show me the passages to back up your ridiculous argument

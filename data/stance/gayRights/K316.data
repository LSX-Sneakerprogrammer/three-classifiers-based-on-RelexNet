I can't talk in depth as I'm at work, but suffice to say that is an extremely simple interpretation of evolution.  Check out  genetic drift .  My argument is slightly different. I was actually trying to say that there isn't a "gay gene." My intepretation of it is that there is a gene that controls hormone balance during pregnancy, which can sometimes become faulty and cause homosexuality. It is the fault of an evolved gene, but not a gene exclusively causing homosexuality. Hope that clears it up.

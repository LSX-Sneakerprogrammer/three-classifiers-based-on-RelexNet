Soccer, you're floundering. lets keep it short and sweet.  The specific thing you requested from me was to give you a legitimate reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion. I did that. You still claim that  every person that is opposed to gay marriage is a bigot  (period). if you don't think that my reason is legitimate, then say so and we'll debate that.  I never said that people should stop fighting for their rights. I said that they should take the high road, which is a slower, longer road. Take the Gandhi road, the Martin Luther king road instead of the low road that may get you there faster. Don't take the "If you are against us you are " road. The low road is a tactic used to get you there faster.  If I recall correctly, I did not compare homosexuals to Nazis. I said that the tactics being used are the same tactics that the Nazis used. This tactic can be used for good. The tactic itself is not evil. The gay movement is not the first to use that tactic. I don't like the tactic.  I think that calling  everyone  who is opposed to gay marriage a bigot is unfair and narrow minded.  When I said, "gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost?" What I mean is,  That the ends do not justify the means. Calling people a bigot in order to get your way is uncalled for.   I've told you in the past when I have up voted you and why. This is the first time I have ever down voted someone. But I respect you enough to explain why I'm doing it. I'm down voting you for insisting that  everyone  who is opposed to gay marriage is a bigot even after I have given you one reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion and you did chose not to respond to that. Your position implies to me that the ends justify the means. I think you can do better than that.  no hard feelings. Peace out ;)

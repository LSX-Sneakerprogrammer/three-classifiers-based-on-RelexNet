Oh please. The right to vote has nothing to do with marriage benefits.   You may be new here so I'll lay out my position for you.  1. I'm not against gay marriage.  2. I see the gay community's fight for gay marriage as an uphill battle.  3. I suggest that the gay community come up with a different name for their unions and force the government to give them the same benefits as heterosexual couples.  4. Alternatively, I suggest that the gay community force the government to give up the use of the word "marriage" and use a new word for both heterosexual, and homosexual marriages.

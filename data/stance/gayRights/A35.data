A contradictory statement cannot make a valid argument   It can. I did proved it. And i will prove it again.    Ask me if you don't know the difference   I understand the difference. Belief may be truth or may be not truth, backed with no strong evidence to support it. Knowledge is belief that may be truth or not but it is backed up with strong evidence. And the probability of it being truth is high. There is no guareentee that it is truth. I believe in God but that isn't knowledge.   But im frustrated why would you discuss this again when i had proven with examples that my belief is somewhat knowledgable. I gave examples.    Do you even know what "overpopulation" means?    lol of course i do. It means when the amount of people exceed the normal amount. Too much people to carry.    I don't see how your analogies relate to homosexuality   I went a little off topic with my comment. I was trying to prove with these anologies the purpose of life. It relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life. And like i said above, i will prove that again.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---   Two contradictory statements:   Homosexuals does not support the purpose of life by not producing children    Homosexuality do support the purpose of life by stopping overpopulation   However, they are both correct.   The purpose of life to advance as humans. One way to advance as humans is to grow in numbers.   Scenario 1. If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Scenario 2. If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   When i say homosexuality is wrong and right. I don't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right. They share a right and wrong like non-homosexual people; like any normal person.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both "right" AND "wrong" at the same time. If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment. Though, i don't really know about that if taking down Hitler would stop the Jewish people from suffering. There were many factors that led to their safety.   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person. If i killed that rapists, i killed a person. I am thus, wrong. However, i am also right for saving a life.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the "one child policy." I think that acts like a Homosexuality Act where couples can't produce more than one child. I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities. The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples. (source: wikipedia).    http://www.prb.org/Articles/2006/ ChinasConcernOverPopulationAgingandHeal th.aspx    The link i provide is interesting because this show that China is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people.

Marriage must always be between consenting adults, because children are unable to give consent under the law; that is a seperate issue. This was understood in the previous argument when it was said that man + woman = marriage.  The point I was trying to make however is that all these stupid little formulas are meaningless, and the best definition of marriage would be one between two people regardless of gender. Age is a completely different argument, and not one that is relevent ot this particular debate.

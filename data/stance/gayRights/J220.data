"with absolutely no life"   What exactly does your life consist of?  Mom wakes you up. Makes you breakfast. You are driven to school. You eat your lunch your mom packed you. You come home and do your homework. Watch tv, maybe whatever it is you do for fun. Eat your dinner your mom makes, go to sleep.

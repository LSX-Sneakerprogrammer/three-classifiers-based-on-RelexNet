Without either a mom or a dad the child is mentally hurt   This is complete bullocks. There is no evidence to support this notion. Studies have been down that show a child of a heterosexual couple is no better off than a child of a homosexual couple.   Even if this were true, do you really think a child with no parents is better off than a child with two homosexual parents? Such arguments have been rendered moot, long ago. This is merely a rationalization for prejudice.

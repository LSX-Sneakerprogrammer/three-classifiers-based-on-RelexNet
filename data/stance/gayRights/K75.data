I don't know if you've noticed but over the last years most churches have been more and more tolerant of gay people and accept them as any other member...just like regular people. Even the civil ceremony calls it a marriage. Pay no attention to what the conversation is between Joe & myself. Most of it doesn't apply...it's a personal thing between us now.

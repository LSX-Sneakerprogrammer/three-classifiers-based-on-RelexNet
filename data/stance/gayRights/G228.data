Well considering we have a OVER populated planet already instead of having to rule how many children a family is allowed to have like China. Why is more gays a bad thing if gay marriage will lead to a slow down in population growth then why hasn't it been legalized sooner? Would you rather have no gay marriage and a over populated plant where children are starving due to having a insignificant amount of food because that is where we are now and going more so to in the near future.

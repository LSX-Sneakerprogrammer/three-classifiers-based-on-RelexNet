When you operate outside social norms you are classified as a Deviant. Your anus or a plastic/steel/wooden rod is not a sexual organ; therefore using them in a sexual act should be considered abnormal, shouldn't it? Having anal sex is like trying to eat food with your eyes (it just was not design for that). The normal curve is used in all fields of studies to classify what is acceptable and what's not. It also determines when mechanical plants are to be changed, unearths systematic errors and blunders. Of special concern are systematic errors, which are frequently caused by miscalibration. This error in a system also produces normal curve, but skewed. Thus, shifting the goal post thereby making previously deviance behaviour acceptable. Thatâ€™s why you (ChadOnSunday221) can no longer see that gay marriages are immoral and unethical; it was a slide of hands. Attempting to make us believe that homosexuality is an identity and not a choice was the tactical manoeuvre. Where will this post be in the future, who knows? Chad we may wake up one morning a discover that rape, child porn, sex with animals, lowered age of consent, etc. are now social norms.

Another point of issue, marriage is a religious icon.   It's possible to marry before the state only, in which case religion has nothing to do with religion anymore.    It hurts us by allowing the government to further violate the constitution by respecting the beliefs of established religion.   Not letting gay people marry is a violation to the 14th amendment.   AMENDMENT XIV  SECTION 1.  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.   If gay people cannot marry, they are deprived of a liberty that other citizens do have. Saying they cannot have this right is like saying they are not citizens, even though this Amendment clearly states "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States".

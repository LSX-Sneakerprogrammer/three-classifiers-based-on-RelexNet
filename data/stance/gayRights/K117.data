OK, I am in perfect agreement with you that this conversation should probably be over. I'll respond to both posts. First, I don't apologize for my opinions. I have, however, clarified to my earlier post, that when I forgot to specifically mention pedophilia as being unrelated to homosexuality, I assumed the reader would group pedophilia and serial murder. I have clarified this point, and I'll say again, pedophilia and serial killing are in no way similar to homosexuality. I was merely using hyperbole to show that people do not have a right to do everything they are born desiring.  "whether people "turn gay" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact."   http://www.cwfa.org/images/content/ bornorbred.pdf   a scholarly response to the idea that this has been pr oven. I'm sure we can both go on all day posting on this idea, the reality is we just don't know. I personally believe people are born with a predisposition toward homosexuality which can either be cultivated or repressed, but everyone has the ability to make decisions in their life. Besides, no one is arguing gays should stop what they're doing (well, some people probably are).  Again, ad homonyms all over. It seems If anyone says something you disagree with the best thing to do is call them hateful and stupid. Oh and gay, but I guess I'm too dumb to get that.  If 51% of people voted for slavery it wouldn't matter because slavery is made illegal by the constitution and the courts would then have an obligation to point that out. That's what it's for. If anyone can show me where it says you have a right to marry whomever you want in the constitution I will go picket in CA right now.  I guess I should be more clear. Gay people have been persecuted for a long time. It's a shame they feel the need to persecute others now that they are gaining popularity. And you can call me a liar whenever you disagree with me if you like (it's very effective I'm sure), but my sister cried every day during the prop 8 thing because she supported it and she was constantly harassed. I never said she was afraid for her life, but that does make the story more interesting, doesn't it :)  "You seem to think I live in some state of fear?"  This was also irony. I was suggesting that discrimination against gays has largely disappeared (that doesn't mean everyone agrees with you, it just means their rights are no longer being violated, i.e. they can get work, they don't get killed (hopefully!), etc). I apologize about thinking you were gay (not that its bad), you made a comment on an earlier post that I must have misunderstood.  "As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights..."  I hate to play the "I'm right" game, but I am here. Do more research, my father is a leader in the Mormon church. While church members donated and were asked to support the legislature, the church itself did not make any political donations. I'm not as sure about the Catholics, but if they're smart they played it the same way. I agree that some of the churches which are heavily political (i.e. Jeremiah Wright?) should get out of politics or be taxed as political entities. Churches do, however, have a right to encourage voting on moral issues (it's actually in the law, believe it or not), and both of these churches are silent on political issues outside of this.  I won't apologize for my opinion. The real irony is that I'm not even opposed to gay marriage. I'm opposed to people who will do anything to get their way, no matter who it hurts. Anyway, you've heard my point of view. I will change it the minute anyone can shows me that gay marriage is a protected constitutional right, or when a vote is passed. Until then, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, and I even respect your right to hate and mock everyone who disagrees with you (thought I will then ask you to respect my right to call you a hateful shallow bigot. yay free speech). I would honestly be happy for everyone to just say, look, you and I disagree, but we have that right and we can still be friends, because right now that's not happening... Oh, and I still don't like the courts usurping authority not given to then by the constitution :)

I was raised by straight parents, does that mean I havn't had an opportunity to be taught anything about prejudice, acceptance, or being different!?   oh and about "How many times do I have to tell you" im not sure that i have used that more than maybe once or twice but I am not fond of having to tell people the same things over and over again.

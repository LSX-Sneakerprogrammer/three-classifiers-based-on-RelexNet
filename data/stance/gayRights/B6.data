I loathe people who think that their version of logic is the proper one - but enough of these insults.  There is  one  logical reason to engage in intercourse. Procreation. Homosexuality  cannot  result in impregnation and thus there is no logical reason to engage in homosexual behavior.  "Because we can..." is not a logical answer. We  can  do a great many things, but that doesn't mean that there is a logical reason to do so.

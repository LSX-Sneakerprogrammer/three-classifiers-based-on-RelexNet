Hello,  Pardon the delay.  Is sex a crime? No, sex is not a crime. Can a crime be committed by sex? Yes, rape is a crime against another person, which generally implies forced sex. Is the desire for sex a crime? (No) Can a crime be committed as a consequence of a desire for sex? Yes, for a rapist desires to have forced sex with another person. In these examples it can be seen that neither sex nor the desire for sex are crimes and that some crimes are sexual.   All physically, healthy men and women are fully capable of committing sexual crimes. However, and thankfully, most do not commit sexual crimes. Most men and women choose to not force themselves sexually unto another person. They are therefore making a conscious decision. Furthermore, all decisions about with whom they will have sex with are choices evidencing their desire.   The desires of all men and women are consequences, not causes. Then what is the cause of desire? Is it internal or external? Is it genetic? In order to answer these questions I must begin with some fundamentals of the lives of all men and women.  All men and women are responsible for the choices they make; they both suffer or benefit from the consequences of their choices; they also cannot rightfully be held accountable for the choices that others have made. For example, Person (A) cannot be justly imprisoned because of the crimes of person (B). Also, if person (A) is coerced by person (B) to perform a certain act or speak a certain word, person (A) has chosen to comply and is therefore responsible. Person (A) suffers the consequences of compliance or resistance; in either situation, person (A) remains responsible for his/her choices. Regardless of the specific choices that men and women make, all choices are consequences of their desires. Ultimately, we can conclude that all men and women will choose according to their desire and must accept the consequences whether they are joyful or sorrowful.   The desire of man is predicated upon at least one value system. And from that value system are all desires identifiable. Simply stated, the value systems are as follows:  1) My needs are more important than the needs of another person. (Identity=selfish,unjust)  2) My needs are equally as important as the needs of another person. (Identity=just,honest)  3) My needs are less important than the needs of another person. (Identity=affectionate)  I have completed my response. But I have only posted part no.1. We can debate this part before we move on to part 2. I have yet to logically tie the pieces together.

"You seem to be mistaking "tradition" for "monopoly". (I assume) You don't mind Muslims marrying and they certainly aren't Christian."    Of course Christians have a monopoly on marraige it's  their  institution, wy is it that homosexuals need to be married in the first place? A civili partnership is good enough for them.  Anyway, the same applies for other religions and their forms of marraige.    "And if you can be bothered to check the bible, there is nothing in there against homosexuality which doesn't have something silly nearby. Since you ignore the sillies, you should also ignore the homophobia."    The Biblie is clearly against homosexuality, that is common knowledge.

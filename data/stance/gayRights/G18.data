It's arbitrary because all I have to do is change the law to suite my preference. Which by the way is something that is actively being done with the age of consent. And this is exactly what is being done with marriage. The law used to say one thing and now that definition is being broadened to suite more peoples personal preferences. Yes, I was using hyperbole to make a point. If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference? Were it ends then becomes an arbitrary standard. And if you don't set one, the thing gets so stretched that it hardly resembles what it first look liked.  Just for the sake of humor:   consent is not a passive action, but an active one. It requires that there is a fulfilling of some verbal criteria, whether written or spoken, and it has to be initiated within the strictures of the ritual.   Me and my cat had a ritual; it actively walked up to the alter in my apartment were I was kneeling and meowed and I respond back with "I love you too" we rubbed noses and I said till death do we part. Then she meowed in response. So I guess we are married and the state needs to recognize it. :)

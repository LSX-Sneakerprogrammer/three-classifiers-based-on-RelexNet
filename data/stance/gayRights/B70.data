" ...there are two sexes on this planet for a reason, if god wanted us to be gay then he would have only created one sex. "  What if this entire world wasn't even planned by God? If you believe that God planned for there to be sexual reproduction and for there to be male and female humans, then I suppose you believe that we were intelligently designed, since God has such a direct impact in the world. Well, if he designed us, then why do our esophagus and trachea intersect, which creates a very dangerous choking hazard? And why do our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve goes into the eye? Couldn't God have designed our bodies to be a little more perfect? I'm not denying God's existence. I'm merely stating that this world wasn't directly created by God like so many people believe. And because of this, there are certain things, like homosexuality, that exist even though they go against religious teachings.

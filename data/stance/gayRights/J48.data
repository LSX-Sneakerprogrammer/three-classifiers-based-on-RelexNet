We shouldn't take kids away from parents unless of course it's abuse or something.    "Gay people have fine morals! They have jobs, they pay taxes, they participate in committed loving relationships, they love and respect their parents."   Not to be crude but the same can be said for child molesters. Homosexuality is also a sin, but you don't believe in god so whats the point in debating?    "Other than what your faith teaches you, what don't you like about homosexuality?  "   Well, I don't like anything that distorts what a family really is. Our definitions of family and morality are obviously different. And it is a sin.

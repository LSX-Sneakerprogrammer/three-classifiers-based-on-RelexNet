Hey, my religion is against that, but that dosent mean it has to be outlawed for everyone  We live in a land of "freedom", even if we can't exercise taht freedom sometimes. It's just violating a citizen's right to free will to prohibit gay marriage.   I'm not really into gay marriage, but if other people are, i wish u luck in standing up for your beliefs

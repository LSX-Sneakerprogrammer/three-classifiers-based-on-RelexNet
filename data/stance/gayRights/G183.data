you have got to be kidding me. "...to start doing things that a gender should not do". why shouldn't they get married? how is it hurting you? just let people feel the way they want to and stop being so closed minded. what do you care if a guy likes a guy or a girl likes a girl? so what? and how DARE you call gays crazy! my aunts are gay and they are the most loving people i have ever met. they are smart, driven, talented, and have contributed greatly to our world and there is no reason why they should be discriminated against. besides, people do other unnatural things as well.. like medicine, technically it is unnatural because our bodies are supposed to have the immune system adequate enough to fight off all diseases. so would you consider those who have to take meds to survive unnatural?

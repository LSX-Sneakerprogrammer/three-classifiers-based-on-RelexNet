I think the argument of sanctity of marriage is horrific.  If you make yourself a loaf of bread and eat it day after day, will it taste any worse if someone else on another planet also gets to make his/her own loaf or bread and eat it?  No it won't. Will the loaf you eat be any less nutritious if someone else on a remote planet also does the same?  No.  Ergo sanctity of marriage is nothing but jealousy of marriage in disguise. You only want marriage for yourself so you can have something that someone else doesn't.  GROW UP KIDS! That kind of behaviours is criticized in kindergarten when a bully wants to have a playground ride only to himself.  Not that I support marriage, I just support everyone's right to call their bond marriage. It's such a stupid trivial childish crap, but since people take is seriously, then I suppose I have to too.  [edit]Hmm, I already used that argument on some other debate, except that I used beans instead of bread.

There is nothing wrong with homosexuals and to be persecuted because of sexual orientation is wrong. If a gay couple wants a kid give them a kid. But I think that there could be consequences and pluses.   But I think that letting them adopt children would be leading those children into an extremely awkward upbringing. That would make them outcasts. Kids are extremely brutal just read A Child's Machiavelli, everything rings true. Picture your average bully not only picking on a kid because of his looks but now he has a weapon that would make that kid a total outsider to all other kids. Kids find it odd when a kid has no father or mother, or when he/she lives with his/her grandparents or are adopted to a hetero family a kid with 2 fathers or mothers doesn't fit into the mix for a proper upbringing in a peers perspective at a young age. It would all lead down a messed up life for the kid down the road he would be confused with his sexual orientation and countless other issues.  But then ,maybe all the toughness would make that kid an even better person than all the other kids that made fun of him or didn't step forward to defend him. I cannot say for sure since I have not had such an experience.  But it is a free country and if one person can adopt another person should be able to as well.

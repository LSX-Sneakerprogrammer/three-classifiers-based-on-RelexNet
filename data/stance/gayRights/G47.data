I totally agree . It's just descrimination! Everyone has his or her own right to do whatever he/she wants to do. I think people are just followers these days if you here one person say " No , being gay is wrong... blah blah" than you automatically agree with them. People just need to grow up and understand you cant get rid of life! You cant get ride of someones right ! you cant get rid of gays ! There humans just like everyone else and if they want be with someone of the same sex than so be it.. It has nothing to do with you. Right? ( Let them do them , and you do you)

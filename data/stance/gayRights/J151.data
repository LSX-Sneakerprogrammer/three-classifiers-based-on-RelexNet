The progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption. I'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard.  If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and "give" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child.   Hence the term "give him/her up for adoption".   You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.  I must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.

How does a single father explain "girl stuff?" That's just fine, but when it happens to be two men, it's not okay anymore. I don't see the difference here.  For that matter, how does a single mother explain "boy stuff?" This situation is socially accepted, but essentially the same thing isn't when it's two of the same sex. As long as the kid's fine who really cares? Why is that?

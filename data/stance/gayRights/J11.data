Who gets custody if a straight couple breaks up? The better parent. Who would get custody is a gay couple breaks up? The better parent.  How do they determine the better parent? The same way they would with a straight couple. There are no differences, because father's have been fighting for their rights to their children.  And yes, parents should get married before they adopt. That's a great reason to let gays get married. Thank you, Tugman.

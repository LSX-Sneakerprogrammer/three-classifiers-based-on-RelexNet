I'm not going to attempt to refute your entire post nor am I going to read it.  Simply being honest here.  But I did skim the first "fact", and all I have to say is.... statistically,  50% of all marriage today end in divorce.  It's a 50/50 shot on marriage today.  And these are straight couples.  Your point is moot.

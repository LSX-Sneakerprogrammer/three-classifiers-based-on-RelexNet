That's good. If sex produces kids then homosexuals should be having kids, unless something else is going on here.  I'll bet you didn't read all 44 pages of the report because you missed the point. I see no reason the state needs to get involved in a homosexual relationship but I can see a lot of reasons for a heterosexual relationship. So back to my original stance on gay marriage; government should remain neutral.  Your question misses the point.

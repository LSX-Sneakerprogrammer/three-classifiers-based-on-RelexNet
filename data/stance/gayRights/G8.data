Wow, that's news to me.   It's news to you that homosexuals have reproductive organs? You do know that a large portion of the current homosexual population has families, and have had children before, right?   About rights, gays have the same rights as the rest of   Except the right to marry. And civil-unions don't grant the same rights as married couples.   They just choose not to exercise them   Like what?   Were is the discrimination in that?   They are prohibited from being married, something that, by the constitution, should be granted. Please see miscegenation case law: Lovings v Virginia, which overturned Pace v Alabama.   If the state issues a license, gives tax incentives, sets up family courts and all the other benefits they extend; I think I would consider that involvemnt.   And thus, it is the business of the government to ultimately ensure that homosexuals can marry as well. If you think otherwise, you're merely arguing "separate but equal", which was found to be unconstitutional as a direct consequence of Brown v Board of Education.

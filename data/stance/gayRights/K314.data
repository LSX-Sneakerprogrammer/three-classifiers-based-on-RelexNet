I am no biologist so my credibility only extends as far as my source's credibility. In this case my source is the video I linked to which is made by a biology student. I have found all of his videos very informative and factually accurate and therefore find no reason to doubt him. If you want to check out his page here it is.   http://www.youtube.com/user/DonExodus2   Most of his videos are about evolution and debunking creationist arguments.

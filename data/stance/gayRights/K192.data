Why would it hurt anyone?  No one should be denied the right to marry no matter who they love and recently in the UK Quaker and Jewish churches have said that if a same sex marriage law is passed they all perform the ceremonies :)  People need to wake up and smell the coffee, homosexuality is not bad, it doesn't cause anymore STI's than heterosexual sex, it is in no way connected to pedophilia and just cause religion says we should condemn them doesn't mean we should  That's gone rather off topic but oh well

"I'm the one that tried to tell people how ridiculous it is to do that. "   That may be, but you just practiced ad hominem against Pineapple.   "By saying that this country allows oppression. It does not. Yes it has in the past. But nothing to that degree is going on right now."   Saying that this country allows oppression is a false accusation? You need to read over American history again. The slaughter of Native Americans, slavery, segregation, Japanese internment camps are all particularly relevant. The degree of oppression is impossible to quantify and totally irrelevant. Any amount of oppression is completely and totally unacceptable. It is a fact that due to religious opinions in this country, same-sex marriage is illegal. While this may not be as severe as slavery, that does not take away from the fact that it is oppression caused by religion and therefore is religious oppression.   "Intolerant? Fear mongering? How so? "   You want to see a fear mongering campaign? I was hoping you would ask.   http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=Wp76ly2_NoI    If you can watch that video and tell me it is not using scare tactics and intolerance, then I am done debating you clearly we cannot agree.   "Okay maybe it was a lame thing to say, I guess the ad homonym[sic] is contagious."   Every time you criticize your opposition it is not an ad hominem. I responded to every one of your points and criticized something you said. And no it does not sound familiar to me. I did not follow any religious traditions as a child and I don't believe I even was told of my parents political affiliations until I had formulated my own opinions. Additionally I am more liberal than both of my parents, and I have changed their minds on many issues, while they have never changed my positions that I can recall.   "I guess then, that I am being oppressed by you two double teaming me on every freaking debate."   Quit belly-aching. I personally relish debating when outnumbered, but it should not make it any more difficult. If your arguments are valid, they will stand against an infinite number of people. There are other conservatives on this website and it is not our fault if they are too afraid to come to your aid.

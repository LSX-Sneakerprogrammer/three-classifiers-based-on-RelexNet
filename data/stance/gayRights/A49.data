No matter how little or how much, you are still guilty.   I really don't care.    Yes you are. I repeat, "I have never argued based on emotion." Get that through to your thick skull, idiot, and then come and rebut me.   You are clearly lying. You stated that i treat your criticisms as a joke because i laughed. Therefore, you argued based off "my"  emotion. You did stated that emotion isn't a logical argument. And i never said you argued off of your emotion. But you argued on my emotion; hence, you argued off of emotion.    But you are now contradicting what you have said previously because there was an implicit assumption that those two concepts are different on your part.   No. I said that knowledge isn't "always" discovered, it is created as well. Im not stating that there isn't never a difference between knowledge discovered and knowledge created. In some examples, there is a difference. In some examples, they are the same.    I won't respond because you haven't answered my criticism that your statement was begging the question.   lol i don't even know how my words "beg the question." I don't understand what you fully mean.    I have never asked you to provide evidence with such a thing. I asked you, many times by now, to justify the need for assuming that society is composed of mostly female homosexuals.   Sigh. How else can i justify my assumption without evidence? Justify means "show or prove to be right or reasonable" as stated by google. Evidence seems like the best way to justify in my perception.    Really?   Unless those straight guys are going to rape those homosexual ladies, i don't ever see those ladies ever producing children. And you know what rape leads to...mental problems. And that isn't good for a society.    No, it is never a good thing to kill anyone, even if that person is a rapist. In other words, if you kill a rapist, you are in the wrong and should be charged for first degree murder.   I would have to disagree with you on that. Why is it never a good thing? In some perspectives, i see it as a good thing if that person isn't harming another soul.    If you can't justify your assumption, then your entire argument falls apart   Morality exists. In order to fully justify it, i have to do a experiment with millions of people.    These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The truth can also be that your intended to disrespect me.   Can we please not get into this. I know that i didn't intend to disrespect you because i am me. You have no say because you are not me.    That is not an argument based on emotion. An argument based on emotion would read something like, "Hitler was evil because he made me angry or sad." Such an argument is fallacious.   I know what you are stating. I know the view that you are looking at this from. However, you did argue off of emotion. If you want to be specific, you should had stated that you don't argue off of my emotion. "My" as in "you."

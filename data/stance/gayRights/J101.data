The argument that "people may bully or harras the child" is flawed. However how about the development stages of the child. Studies have shown that a child needs a mother and a father to develop..... both genders do have specific roles to play. Now I am not disputing that same sex couples will be bad parents, I am sure they will be good parents, but human nature is that children should be brought up in a dual gender relationships.

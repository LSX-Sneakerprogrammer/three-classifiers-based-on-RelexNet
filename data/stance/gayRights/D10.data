I don't question anyones existence...I do however question what is right and wrong and how it might affect me.  Do you want to live next door to a whore house? Strip club? How about a landfill?   Ones beliefs sometimes are insulting but that does not mean that we are not aloud to have them. I believe that homosexual sex is not natural. If that hurts someone I am sorry, but it is my belief. I have never said things to be political correct, but to share my belief system honestly.   I believe that allowing gays to marry would harm society in the long run. I think its a very important issue.

I think Gay marriage does affect our society. Back in the day There weren't gay people because it was unthinkable. Who Would like another man/woman? But now more and more its being free and open. I saw youtube video for a 14 year old kid. He said in his video "I think I want to be gay" I don't know I don't want to be like everyone else. He's right that its a personal choice but he took it so lightly. Thanks to the media. What if this kid was your son? I'm not against gay people at all. Just how it affects people that would have been straight.

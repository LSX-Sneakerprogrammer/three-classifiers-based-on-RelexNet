I don't like the way this question is phrased.   People should be "allowed" to be with whoever they want. And they're going to. Even if we decided to be unconstitutional and dissolve the separation of church and state how would you enforce peoples personal relationships? So naturally people should be legally allowed to  be with  whoever they want.   But that doesn't mean we have to change the definition of  marriage . The protection of marriage is about protecting the definition of marriage by law. So it's not a question of gay people being oppressed.   So "gay marriage" does exist in some states. So it's more a question of should the definition of marriage be changed at a national level. Why? Marriage is a religious thing. So it all seems kind of ironic. Most People for gay marriage are not religious.   It would be a good compromise if they formed some other type of union. I think they just wan't what they can't have. It's like two children and a toy.

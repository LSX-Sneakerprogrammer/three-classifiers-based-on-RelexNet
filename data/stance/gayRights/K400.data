What defines a parent? The person who gave an egg and the person who gave the sperm? I have cousins who are adopted and are perfectly normal and healthy, I have those friends I spoke of before who just adopted less than a month ago. These people are all parents regardless of the fact that they did not give birth to these children! This would be no different if 2 gays adapted. I think that being a parent is more about loving and supporting a child than just knocking some woman up! There are thousands of men out there who get a woman pregnant but have nothing to do with the child's life. The way you are defining being a parent this man would be a father... yet has not doing a damn thing other than ejaculate!

You seem to be mistaking "tradition" for "monopoly". (I assume) You don't mind Muslims marrying and they certainly aren't Christian.  And if you can be bothered to check the bible, there is nothing in there against homosexuality which doesn't have something silly nearby. Since you ignore the sillies, you should also ignore the homophobia.  But I would agree that Churches shouldn't be forced to hold them.

Thanks E223, I'm getting so bored of replying to these. Tallblondguy - whether people "turn gay" or are born gay, is  not  a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of  opinion.  It's a fact. People are born gay, straight, or bi. Any change is due to chemical composition of the brain. People take forever coming out of the closet (often) because gays are discriminated against.   The next paragraph where you say my response is an example of how society tells people to be gay... I think you miss read. It was an ironic diatribe of Jake's senseless response to gay marriage. You see, ironic because  he  though not intentional, was giving a bigoted response, so I pointed out how his response made it appear he was one of the people himself that he was being a bigot against... I know confusing. What's even more confusing is that infact the response  would not have even worked  had it been, as you said, me  encouraging  him to be gay... I don't, from your arguements, expect you to understand that.  Okay, your entire right to vote arguement boggles the mind. According to your own arguement, (this is called a parody, it helps people like you who can't understand stuff, understand stuff. I'm waiting though for your literal response, since I'm sure you won't get the nuance) if 51% of Americans say we should reinstate slavery, then we didn't, then that means some great travesty had taken place, enough said.  Uh... okay, now to where you twisted around my arguement to mean something completely and obviously different than what I said.    you  said that gay people were  not  discriminated against. I gave an example of how they were. Then you went all "black people this" and "fear" that, and went on a rant about losing your job.  You seem to think I live in some state of fear? You're aware that I'm not gay right? If not, now you are, not that it matters in the least in any of my arguements. So I'm not sure why you think I may be afraid of something, but from my profile you can actually follow a link to my site, which has my name, David Heintzelman, it even has a map of exactly where I live for shits and giggles. Again, where you got the idea I was afraid is beyond me. You though... first you accuse me of being afraid, then you say how you post anonymously because... you're scared. It seems a bit schitzo.  As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights...   http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_11102139    http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/ queer-town/queer-town-the-catholic- power/    Last paragraph; you make the point earlier in your arguement (albeit the point was completely out of context of the arguement you were then debating) that just because  "African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers?"  And so I would say the same of any of the vandalism you're implying is the work of the gay hordes - of which I have heard of none, a link wouldn't hurt your arguement there.  And there's a whole debate already devoted to whether religions should pay taxes, where I posted I think a couple times at least. But for the record, they should. Any group that tries to influence policies of a nation, should than have to participate as a member of that society, hence pay taxes. If religious groups want to maintain their tax exempt status, they should excuse themselves from influencing policy. You can't have your cake and eat it to.

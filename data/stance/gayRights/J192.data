This is a touchy subject. However, I believe that it's important for a child to have been raised by a  mother  and a  father . Each parent gives his or her child different life lessons and raises a child differently. Sure, one man could act as the father and the other as the " mother ", but I think gender is a factor in how you raise your child, no matter sexual orientation. And then there's single parents. The difference there is that they are open to dating other people, so the boyfriends or girlfriends can come into the home and help the single parent in raising his or her child.

Jake, you're misquoting me now. Which I appreciate less than paraphrasing.  When I said, "If you don't have anymore valid points then shut up!" you simply quoted, "shut up!" And when I said, "If you don't make a valid point soon, you're going to look very stupid" you simply quoted, "you're going to look very stupid."  By leaving out those words, you attempted to make me look belligerent. Which in turn made you look stupid... which I warned you about.  And I'm not accusing the country of everything. I'm doing exactly what that guy is saying, accusing Mormonism. Because they spent millions of dollars to spread lies about the California constitution, schools, Obama, and a lot more.  Your Religion monetarily supported my oppression. (Evident by the above.)

And if a gay couple adopts a child in a state where gay adoption is legal then moves to (or vacations in, drives through, etc.) a state where gay adoption is illegal, are there custody rights put in question?   The full faith and credit clause, requires that all states must respect the laws and decisions of other states. This way you do not have to re-marry every-time you move to a different state. Yet despite this, some states refuse to acknowledge gay marriages from other states, thus violating the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. There is a lack of consistency in this area.

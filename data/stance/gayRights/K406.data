What if I thought  you  shouldn't be allowed to raise kids? Would that give me the right to take away your right to adopt?  Unless you have some proof that children of homosexual parents are somehow harmed, then you are just spouting bullshit. I actually know people with gay parents. I would love to see you repeat what you just said to their face.

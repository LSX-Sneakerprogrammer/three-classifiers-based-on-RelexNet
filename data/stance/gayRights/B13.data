Rights are a human construct, and thus are unnatural.   Rousseau disagrees. Hobbes and Rousseau had this debate roughly 400 years ago. Rousseau's view prevailed. Rights flow from the natural right that everyone has a right to dictate their own destiny. Hence, they're not a human construct.   Hobbes? Was he the writer of Leviathon?   Yes.   Was the chaos and warfare of the middle ages caused by a lack of human rights? Or rather by overbearing monarchs?   Both. Overbearing monarchs infringed on human rights.   How does homosexuality promote peace and order? Greece, Rome - all the homosexual 'hotspots' throughout history have fallen.   Greece and Rome did not fall due to homosexuality. The rights of homosexuals to get married promotes peace and order, because it will please them thereby preventing civil unrest. Granting them this right does not infringe on the rights of others and is not a threat to public safety.

I shall quote from the honest book of truth why it is right:  "The grey face has attempted to domineer over our pineal glands to an extraordinary extent."  "The law of five grants you the content you are looking for...".   Ah ha, well then, it must be true that homosexuality is OK, even good.  Seriously though, care to make a real argument?

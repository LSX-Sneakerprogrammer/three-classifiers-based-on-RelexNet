"legal rights...or...acceptance by society?"   Both. It's very hard to obtain legal rights without acceptance by society.   "easily solved by giving united gay couples the same rights after their union"   Haha, if it were really that easy, same-sex civil unions would be legal in all fifty states.   "a and b above are the main elements to a marriage."   The "upholding the sanctity of our dictionaries" argument is retarded beyond belief. I can't believe so many of you are picking it up. We're talking about marriage in the  legal  sense. The common meaning of the term is completely irrelevant in this debate.  This debate is really about one question: Is homosexuality ok, or is it not? And if you leave religion out of the picture, as you should, the answer is inescapable: Yes, it's ok.

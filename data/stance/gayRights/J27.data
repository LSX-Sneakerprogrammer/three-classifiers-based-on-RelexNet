"Me saying that you're a chore was never an argument. It was a statement about how I feel."   Well I don't care  what  you think of me. You can keep your childish  feelings  to yourself. :D   "we live in a country of religious freedom... where religion has the freedom to oppress."   FALSE  Now you are blaming America. Well I'm on Americas side. You should be more grateful to live in this country.

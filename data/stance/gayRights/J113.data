I not only wonder what kind of Buddhism YOU practice after giving a very poor and disgusting diatribe on Christianity...I wonder most of all where you're getting all your Reward POINTS and UP VOTES from for only being here for 13 days and gone the last four? Can it be that Buddhists have multiple personalities which create multiple accounts? I have NEVER seen such utter hatred and blather so richly and constantly REWARDED on this site!

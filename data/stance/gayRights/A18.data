[*I'm not homosexual but I do agree.]  Why shouldn't they? Gays also have feelings to each other. They're also same human-beings like us but only the fact that they are homosexual. That doesn't mean that Gays should not get married.   Loving each other can lead to marriage and that's normal. What's peculiar is that they both are homosexual "ONLY".   But, they should also have those kind of things where we register(?) ourselves as a married couple in law so that they have that feeling of being responsible for what they are doing, that is, marriage. Marriage is something that people should be carefully concerned with, and the same goes for Gay couples too!  They should be responsible and must think of what their 'adopted' child (if they're going to have one) might think of their parents too. Because, all these are something very crucial.

You seem to be assuming that every homosexual agrees with this point   I've never said that.  The first thing you wrote just dosen't make sence. What does it matter how you felt in love? Everyone has the right to get married.  Also, there are many many gay couple, who really wants to have children.  But unmarried people don't get to adopt. And the gay's aren't allowed to get married. So their chance of having a child are small, if not impossible.  Also, if they were allowed to get married and then adopt, then alot of children will get homes, its a win win situation, and I can't see why anyone loses at any point?  Does it bother you seeing two men or women together?  Does it bother anyone seing two men or women together?  Im not saying ALL gays should get married. The ones who want to, they should do it.

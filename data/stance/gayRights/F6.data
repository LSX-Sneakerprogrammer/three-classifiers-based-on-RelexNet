Okay, don't worry about that bit, it doesn't matter.  You just saying you think they should have the right is the same as someone else saying they shouldn't have the right.   Also, there are many many gay couple, who really wants to have children.  But unmarried people don't get to adopt. And the gay's aren't allowed to get married. So their chance of having a child are small, if not impossible.   Unmarried people can adopt, at least in the UK and US, but google tells me it makes the process a little easier, so that's a good point that I hadn't considered.  Depends. Two men kissing is fine but I wouldn't really want to see them getting up to their private business. With women, I'd be quite happy to watch that all day.   Even kissing does bother a lot of people though, and I see that as being their own fault. Unfortunately, the majority of voters seem to be in this category. And democracy is founded on the voters wishes.

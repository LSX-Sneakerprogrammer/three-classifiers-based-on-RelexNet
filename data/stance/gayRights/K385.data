Because the way you worded your statement shows that you believe that it isn't "ok" to be gay as you were apparently scared of children thinking it is ok to be gay. See? You can't even see the way you think clearly yourself. Gay people are the way they are. They aren't an aberration or a fluke or the consequence of a choice. They are human beings that simply prefer same sex partners AND THAT IS OK.

Too many kids in the foster care program are being ignored in some states because they wont let a gay couple take them in. Well how about we send that kid back to their messed up home! I'm sure they'd love it their too. I think in the rare cases that they live in a homophobic comunity they would rather deal with the ridicule of having gay parents then the ridicule of having bruises all over their face.

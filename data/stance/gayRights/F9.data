That is a pretty appalling system.   I agree :)   You asked me if it bothered me/others to see them. That is my feelings on the matter. I don't tend to see it unless I happen to be in a gay bar, but that isn't often. While I don't really care, some people do. And unfortunately 51% of voters are allowed to oppress everyone else. My concern is that gay marriage is being voted against, which means that more people don't like seeing it than those that can be bothered to vote for something which will probably never affect them. And while we may disagree with the result, it's hard to argue with democracy.   Wow, I didn't think people could ever be so stupid. They just want people to look at them selves, than to look at gays  Im not saying that its your opinion, but if people really think that, they're crazy.  I really don't know wich side you're on actually :P Its okay to be natural tho

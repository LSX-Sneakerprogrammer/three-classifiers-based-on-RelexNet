I felt free to down vote that response. I hate getting opposed responses for things I can hardly remember anyways,   I would appreciated if you would not use such bad language when talking to me. And don't give me one of those immature well I will say it anyways rants and then type every offensive word in the book.. thats old. And I know about the first amendment I am only stating what I would appreciate. Oh well, I'm sure you can think of something els, go ahead.   For the record I do understand that I am not being forced to marry homosexually. That's a good thing. I'm also not forced to agree with the few that it is morally correct.   The problem is that people don't wan't people telling them that they can't vote based on their religious beliefs. I believe that homosexuallity is morally wrong and I don't want it in my country. I'm not alone. There is nothing you can do about it and you can't change my mind.   Prop 8 passed. Do you have a problem with democracy? Move somewhere els.   You and people like you and all of Hollywood are trying to beat the majority of American citizens. Trying to sway everyone. That's not good. History shows that. The few being in control is a bad thing.    " Two people you don't know getting married doesn't effect you at all! "   So I'm only allowed to vote and have opinions on tings that effect me personally? You don't think I should? That's to bad.

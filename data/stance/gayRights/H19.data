you can't possibly compare sensible rights with right to same-sex marriage...  gays have the same rights as straights do. they can marry someone of the opposite sex.  this is more of a civil matter, and although i will vote as much as possible to legalize gay marriage, people with YOUR argument just cause less support for it.

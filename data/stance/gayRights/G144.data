What? there is too a heterosexual relation ship and homosexual relationship. I've seen it with my own eyes. Your logic makes no sense.  Love = Love is not the same for all players.  I love my daughters and I love my wife. It's not the same kind of love. Gay love making and heterosexual love making is different. One leads to procreation. ;)

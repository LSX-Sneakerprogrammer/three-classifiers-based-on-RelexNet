Says who? Why?  Your statement can't even be considered an argument because you just say something without backing it up. Marriage is about so much more then having kids. It's about two people who are in love making a lifelong commitment to each other.  How about this...go to a wedding. See how many times children are mentioned in the ceremony. Assuming it's a typical wedding, the answer would be none.  How about people who are infertile...should they not get married either?  Your arguments make no sense, and lead me to believe you haven't really thought critically about these issues at all.

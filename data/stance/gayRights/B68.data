Homosexuals hurt the idea of family morales, what if they were to adopt a kid, and all of his/her friends ask why they have 2dads, or 2 moms. The kids dont know, and honestly, so do I. I dont really care if there are gay people and they do there freaky stuff in their private life, but getting married is too much. And i agree with soccerstud, there are two sexes on this planet for a reason, if god wanted us to be gay then he would have only created one sex. Plus, you need 2 different sexes to make a normal family work, you need breast milk, you need sperm cells, you need egg cell, you need both the female and the male to function as a normal family, and in my opinion, gay married couples are not a normall functioning family.

I'll admit, I do not support gay marriage. This does not mean I hate gays or think homosexuality is a sin. Marriage I feel should be between a man and a woman. In the U.S., this decision I believe should be voted on in a State by State fashion. It should be up to the individual state to allow gay-marriage. If in my state we voted on it and is passed, so be it. If I can re-call Arizona, Florida, and California had a vote on Gay Marriage, and I believe all three votes came out to be against gay marriage. California, who would have thought? I think when it comes to gay marriage this has a major "Bradley Effect".   As for the rest of the world, its up to the rest of the countries to decide whether or not to accept it.

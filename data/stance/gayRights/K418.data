Kirstie, Fact is Kids are cruel. If its not gay then they are cruel bout those who are tall, fat, thin, short, have curly hair, don't have the latest clothes. Point is kids are always going to find something to pick about. I was picked on because I was adopted and my parents weren't my "real" parents so I must have had something wrong with me. Then when they got tired of that it was my weight, then my height, then who I dated. Having gay parents isn't going to change anything for a kid being teased by children raised by close minded parents.

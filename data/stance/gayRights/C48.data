Sometimes people get an idea stuck in their head and it becomes impossible to shake. It will likely take someone besides me to explain what you are interpreting incorrectly so if this post doesn't work I will leave it to someone else.  law passed by another state has no effect =/= FFC clause has no effect  Utah can "recognize" that 2 people did something that Massachusetts calls a marriage but Utah can say that act has no "effect" within its borders.  I gave you a case where 2 of the top attorneys in the country are challenging DOMA in the Supreme Court and they are not arguing that it violates the FFC clause. Can you find any case where any credible attorney is arguing otherwise?

Where I come from you have to be married if you want to adopt, and you can't marry the same sex.   That is a pretty appalling system.    I don't get what you're saying here, and I have no idea what difference it makes considering what you want to watch, and what you don't.   You asked me if it bothered me/others to see them. That is my feelings on the matter. I don't tend to see it unless I happen to be in a gay bar, but that isn't often. While I don't really care, some people do. And unfortunately 51% of voters are allowed to oppress everyone else. My concern is that gay marriage is being voted against, which means that more people don't like seeing it than those that can be bothered to vote for something which will probably never affect them. And while we may disagree with the result, it's hard to argue with democracy.

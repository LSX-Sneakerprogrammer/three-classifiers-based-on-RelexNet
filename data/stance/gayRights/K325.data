Marriage protects women. Women are more at risk in this world. . .and the fact there there are places in the world where the hate is against ones gender. . .that a woman can never be free, or even viewed as human.   And before you all come back and say "different issue" it is more topical then dragging references to interracial marriage into the debate. And for the record I never heard people say interracial marriage would hurt marriage. . .what I heard was the idea of the children suffering as reasons against it. . .  and now that we have a mixed race president they were proved wrong.

I'm all for replacing marriage with a different contract that likewise incorporates someone into your family, just with out the religious and sexual undertones.   Whats wrong with people getting divorces? Especially if their gays because the only kids they can have are adopted ones. Most people won't decide and won't be allowed to adopt unless their in a stable situation. Gay divorce has Little Effect on children, and well...what other effect does it have besides two guys/girls don't have the same rights to each other which they used to. Its a contract, people should be able to enter and leave it.

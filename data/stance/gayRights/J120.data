Sorry to you and to all who have seen my rubbish and nonsensical posts about christianity and were offended by them. What you said made absolute sense to me and i apologize for what wrong i had done.  Especially to those who had their efficiency dropped for no rhyme of any reason.  I hope you could forigve me and let the past behind us.  One more thing, i do live in Singapore and i have '524493' for my Zip-code and not 52449. I really wished i could add that '3' in to clear some misunderstandings but there is not enough space i guess. :]

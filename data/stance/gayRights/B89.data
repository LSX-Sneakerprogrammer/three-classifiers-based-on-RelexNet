I'm all for replacing marriage with a different contract that likewise incorporates someone into your family, just with out the religious and sexual undertones.    We already have that. It's called marriage. It's not a religious or sexual issue. It's a state issue in recognizing the merging of two families. The religious ritual is a superfluous (but meaningful to some) practice. It actually has no bearing whatsoever on the actual legitimacy of the marriage. And honestly, I don't see what sex has to do with marriage. If it was relevant at all, we'd stop impotent or infertile people from marrying. But we don't. It's only relevant when all these closeted homosexuals struggle against their sexuality and try to fight the very things they're doing in secret.

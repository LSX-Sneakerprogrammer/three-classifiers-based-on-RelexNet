To be or not to be...That is not the question.I would say...THIS IS TOTALLY WRONG!! Gay marriage can never be allowed! A man should marry a woman, and technically vice-versa. Why would a man marry another man?! that action is so abnormal...i say that gay (homosexual) people have a psychological problem. What makes them tick? why would men or women act as their opposite gender? THAT is the question. As a matter of fact, there should be no homosexuals at all because it is not right to start doing things that a gender should not do.  summary: No gay people, not even relationships or marriages.

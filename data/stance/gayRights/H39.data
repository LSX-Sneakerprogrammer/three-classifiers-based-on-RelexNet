1. Who doesn't?  2. The point is you shouldn't have to.  3. Once again, the point is that some decisions shouldn't be put to group vote. If someones rights are restricted, and taking away that restriction has  no negative effect  on anyone, then there is no reason to vote.  4. Wow, really? Here in Delaware we only have mush. (In case you didn't get it, I'm being a sarcastic dick here).  5. Do you disagree with my analogy? You said that you want homosexuals to leave, and you called them immoral.   Take a look at this  story  about the kkk boycotting halmark because they began making same sex wedding cards. They disagreed with how America was being multiculturalised (they're words not mine).  Obviously I am not accusing you of lynching black people, or using terrorism, but what I do want you to understand is that the bigotry and intolerance for those different from yourself is equally comparable. I know that your immediate reaction is to take offense to this statement, but know that the only reason that there appears to be a difference between your problem with homosexuals and the racism that used to exist (and in some places still exists) in America is that the former is more socially acceptable.  Trust me Jake I know. Gays are considered icky. "Dude, don't be gay" or "what are you a faggot?" are common because being homosexual is socially unacceptable among many people. I'm probably guilty of using similar phrases myself, and I'm not proud of that fact. What I desperately want you to understand is that homosexuality is not a lifestyle choice. Some people are  born  different, and if we shun them for being different, make fun of them, and convince them that the feelings that they have are immoral, then we really are no better then the racists of our past.  You claim homosexuality to be immoral. When I attack this point, you hide behind a Bible and complain about me attacking your opinions. Then when I argue that there are numerous acts that the Bible considers immoral, but yet you choose to ignore, you say something along the lines of,  well obviously that stuff isn't immoral , and I would agree. There is nothing immoral about touching pigskin, or eating shellfish. However, unless you can differentiate between these actions and homosexuality then you are merely cherrypicking from the Bible what you want to believe.  So now, Jake, I must ask you for what is probably the twentieth time: what makes homosexuality immoral? Please do not use the argument that lots of people agree with you...we can both see how that is not a valid argument. Also, I must ask you not to respond: "that's just my opinion" because that is not even a position. We must have reasons for our opinions, and those reasons must make sense, otherwise we are deluding ourselves.  I look forward to your response.

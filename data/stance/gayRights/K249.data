"The owners of eharmony.com are REQUIRED to provide gay matchmaking. They have no freedom to do otherwise. Doctors who provide in vitro fertilization are REQUIRED to do it for lesbian couples, even if this is against their beliefs."   These are separate issues. Whether or not eharmony should be required to provide service to homosexuals has little to do with whether homosexuals should be allowed to marry. Same with in vitro. The issue is not "Are gays entitled to do everything that straight people are?", the question is, "How does  gay marriage  hurt anyone?"

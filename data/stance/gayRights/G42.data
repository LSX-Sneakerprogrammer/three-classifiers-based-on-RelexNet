Yes of course it should  No majority ever has the right to decide the life of a minority, which does no harm to anyone  It was that logic, which cause the slave trade and while you still decide how others should live then they are slaves  "Why don't you try and use the art of persuasion to convince my that a lifestyle that causes early death (@45yrs of age) high rates of infectious diseases, depression and suicide is really a good thing. And that it is some how the more loving thing to do to let someone destroy their life."  - Find one single gay person over 45 should be impossible then?  - straight people can catch those same diseases, they just have better access to healthcare without being discriminated against  - depression and suicide again cause by discrimination and the struggle to accept yourself as different in a world with so many biggots and small minded people  - The above quote was wrote by a clearly retarded person who would have owned a slave, voted against womens and black peoples rights and can't see that being gay is not a disease, it is natural and present in over 500 species  Gay marriage would not and cannot harm straight marriage  It is proven that gay marriages are more stable and that the most suitable family environment is actualy with two lesbian mothers  If anything harms marriage it is straight people like britney spears and people who pass their prejudice onto their kids

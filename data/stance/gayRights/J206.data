Well to sort of counter the downvotes, I'm going to just add another argument. I really love it when people downvote without a reason... not! Seriously, if you're going to downvote an argument that you  disagree  with, say so! If it's bad grammar, which is rare for me, then fine (and not just one misspelled word). This is a legitimate argument with no misspellings or grammatical errors and there is NO right to downvote it.

This makes no sense, how could your friend have been given extra time for beating up a Homo if the Homo was too Chicken Shit to admit it, if the person they beat up admitted it and your friend got extra time it was probably because it was classed as a hate crime which I assume is dealt with in a sterner manner than any other violent crime and would be dealt with the same if they beat up someone because they were a different Religion or Race. Did your friend beat the other person up because the other person was Gay or was there another motive?

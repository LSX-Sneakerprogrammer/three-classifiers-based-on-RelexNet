There is a perfectly good reason. If you change the definition of the word marriage to be "a civil union between two consenting adults" then there won't be a word specify a heterosexual marriage.   If some one said to you "I know this married couple, Amari and Jaidyn, who...."  and we were to use the current definition, then you would know that one of those people is male and the other female (although you may not be able to decide which is which). If we used your definition then we would have no idea if they were one of each, two males or two females.  The purpose of language is to clarify, not obfuscate. Otherwise, lets do away with half the words in the English language. We can combine the words that kind of have nearly the same meaning into one word. if that sounds like a crazy idea to you, then you are begining to understand that my stance against using the word marriage for gay unions has nothing to do with being a bigot.

Does marriage have a religious origin?  No. Marriage has always been a state institution, always requiring the recognition of the state regardless of what ritual religious or secular is attached to it.   I don't have an information to back me up here, but I find this statement highly dubious. For one thing, in much of recent history (up until the last century or so) church and state have been identical in many countries. Certainly now marriage must require the recognition of the state, but you would really have to show me some info to prove it's always been that way. Anytime you use the word "always" you had better have some damned good data to back you up.

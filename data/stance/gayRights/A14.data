Instead of wasting my time and replying to everyone about my mistake, im going to state it here.   I should have been more clearer with my argument. I should had said that homosexuals are  not totally wrong  and  not totally right.  Saying that they are will make the contradicting truth false. With this information, im believing that the truth can be contradicting. Contradictions are examples of false information. However, when i evaluate the contradiction i provided, both of them are truthful in their own senses. I went a little off topic but if the author intended us to talk about children, then my argument shouldn't be dismissed.   Now here is my answer to this debate:   Why not? It is a choice and everybody deserves to get married to the ones they love.

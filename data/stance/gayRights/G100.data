Being Gay is NOT a disease buddy. You should do yuour research before you decide to voice a remark as that!! Being stright is who you are. I never had any attraction to the opposite sex, not even as a small child. I did not wake up one day and say, "oh , I want to be gay today". Our lives are very hard because of the ignorance of some people in society. mabey discrimination is a disease or mabey you yourself has issues with your own sexuality and hoping for some magical "gay cure" that will help you with your own sexual insecurites.   remember , GOD made us in his vision. You or no one else has the right to judge or to delegate to me who I decide to have in my bed.

Yes, it's no big deal as in the world won't end or society won't collapse like you said, but that's the same as a waiter bringing me an orange juice (OJ) when I asked him for a lemonade and explain to me that it's the same and it's no big deal. I mean it's a drink and it'll quench my thirst, hell it even has a similar citrusy quality, but it's not lemondade so it shouldn't be called lemondade.  .  A marriage is a bit more important than a drink and when it comes to marriage, I do actually want my children to grow up with the same idea of marriage as mine. This is because my goal is to watch them eventually find a suitable partner, love each other forever and bear me grandchildren, etc.. I suspect that lots of other people feel the same way, and even though things do not always turn out as perfectly as we would like, the goal should not shift. Changing the definition of the word marriage is the first step away from that goal. Sure the children will find their own ways and decide what marriage is by themselves and everything like that, and I may not have much input into the process, but  if they should ever need guidence in their lives  (and I'm sure that we all do sometime in our lives) they can come to me, and I'd guide them accordingly and I'd have a legal backup. In terms of the word marriage, I re-assert my view that its definition should even be more narrow than it is currently. Old men and young women should not be included.  .  Now, people can drink OJ and call it lemonade if they want (in Vietnam they call a cheese sandwich: "hotdog"), I fully respect that, but I don't think that the definition of lemondade should change. I respect people's choices :) and they can do what they like amongst themselves.

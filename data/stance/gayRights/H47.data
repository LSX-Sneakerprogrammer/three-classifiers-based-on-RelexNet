The eventual alien invasion??? By the looks of things we've already been invaded!  What you're saying is that any two people who marry must have children or it renders their commitment to one another moot! That is one of the saddest statements I've ever heard. What would you do Tug if you married and your wife couldn't have children for some reason. Would you divorce her and move on to someone fertile? What would you expect your wife to do if it were you whose sperm was not healthy enough to fertilize an egg?  The fact is that Gays can have children in ways including adoption and artificial insemination and there is nothing but personal opinion to prevent that from taking place. Straight people fear Gay folks mostly because they understand little about them. They're just like you Tug...just like you and everyone else in the world.

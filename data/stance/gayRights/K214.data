Okay, I know SEVERAL children of same-sex parents and they turn out wacko.    Define "whacko." On a side note, I know SEVERAL children of opposite-sex parents and they turn out wacko.   I'm sorry, I can't support this scientifically   REALLY? Who the fuck would have ever guessed that?   but anyone else at my school will verify this.   You know you have a great argument when your basis is the opinion of a selective group of misguided school children. Obviously they know better than centuries of scientific observation, experimentation, and discovery.   A child who grows up seeing same-sex marriage will learn that it is okay.   I agree. And that is a GREAT thing. What exactly is wrong about homosexuality?   He will even think that it is his decision   No. Homosexuality is NOT a choice. We have scientific evidence to support this....that is unless those school children say otherwise.   Society won't benefit. America will become even more decadent.   WTF?

Marriage, by definition, is a legal contract between a man and a woman. Refusing to change this definition arbitrarily is not discrimination. Lawmakers should not allow gay marriage on the grounds that the two counterparts are of the same sex, which does not fit the marriage definition.  This fact does not mean the legal system is discriminating against the gay orientation or of gay relationships. A solution to the problem would be a whole other kind of legal union for gay couples to enter into. As of now, marriage is a legal covenant designed to take into interest the future plans of a man and women and progeny.

If there is a conflict between the Constitution and a Federal law, it is the Constitution that presides over such cases where the conflict exists. In this case, where DOMA conflicts with the full faith and credit clause, it is the full faith and credit clause that reigns supreme.  In 1808, Justice Marshal in the Marbury v Madison case declared:  "So, if a law [e.g., a statute or treaty] be in opposition to the Constitution, if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the Court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the Court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply."

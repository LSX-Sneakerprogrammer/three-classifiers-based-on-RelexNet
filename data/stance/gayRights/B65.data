Just don't call it marriage and the hatred is over! THis forum is full of religion haters is not marriage a religious concept? So let the religious people have it and call it something else. This is a liberal arguement so it makes no sense to me that you want the term marriage anyway, you hate everything that leans towards religion so why not hate the word 'marriage'? Just stay with your 'legal union' or whatever it's called and everyone is happy.

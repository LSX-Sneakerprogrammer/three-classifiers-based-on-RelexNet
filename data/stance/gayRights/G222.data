Actually its been scientifically proven that the reason people are attracted to the same sex is usually because they have more of the opposite hormones that their sex is supposed to supply. For example. Say female hormones are x's and male hormones are P's well if a male and a male are interested in each other the male produces more x's then p's. Nothing wrong with it, it's normal and it human. Nobody is born perfect and nobody is born flawless. If a man and a women are together awesome! if a women and a women are together great! if a man and a man are together then at least they can act like more of a man then most straight guys can. They aren't afraid of people who are against them they just want to be happy and go for it.

Some times it feels like gays are trying to force themselves into a club where they are clearly not wanted.  There are two parts to the gay marriage issue.  1. The love aspect  2. The benefits  The love aspect can be resolved in many different ways. They can:  1. Have their own ceremony with friends and relatives  2. Petition religions to change their stance on gay marriage  3. Start their own religion  The benefits aspect can be resolved simply by petitioning the government to stop using the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple (with age of consent) to join in a civil union.  In short, this issue shouldn't even be an issue because there are ways around the situation. If you don't want to go around the situation, then you're trying to force yourself in. If you are trying to force yourself in, then clearly, you are not wanted there.

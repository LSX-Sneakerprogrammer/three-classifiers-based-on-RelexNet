first off stop making argument's that make you dizzey if you try to read it. Second   "I know for a fact that some people DO choose to "be gay" as one of my friends is newly gay"  ok you both are wrong ok you are wrong for acting like you KNOW exacly what happens and the same to the other guy now i THINK that it can go either way just like you can be born with aids and you can get them ( i wasn't implying anything but i was stating a fact) and you can be born with knowledeg and you can get it. so there!

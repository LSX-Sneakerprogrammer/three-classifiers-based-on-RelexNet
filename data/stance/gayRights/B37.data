I can put them in standard form if you'll like. I just gave you a logical argument on why you should use condoms. I can do it for homosexuality.   1. A person should do what they enjoy, so long as it doesn't conflict with other people's justified rights.  2. A person would enjoy having sex with an available adult member of the same sex.  ---------------  3. A person should have gay sex.

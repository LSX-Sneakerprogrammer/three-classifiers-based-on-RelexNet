I do not think we should label 'religion' as nonsense. Having a moral code is a valuable part of human life, whether or not we define it as religion. But I don't want to change the argument: yes, I agree, just because a religious doctrine may discourage homosexuality, does not mean we must apply that doctrine to a secular government.  But please, feel free to add to this argument/write against it. I am encouraging more debate!

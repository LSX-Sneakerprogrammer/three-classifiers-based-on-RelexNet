Yes!!  People have no control over who they fall in love with, male or female. It is wrong for gay marriage to be illegal because it's like trying o control people's feelings and feelings can't be controlled.  Sure, many Christians find it wrong, but everyone has the freedom of choice; to choose what they want, whether it's being gay or not.

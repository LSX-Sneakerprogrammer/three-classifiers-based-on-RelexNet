Unmarried people can adopt, at least in the UK and US, but google tells me it makes the process a little easier, so that's a good point that I hadn't considered.   oh sorry, I wasn't aware of that.  Where I come from you have to be married if you want to adopt, and you can't marry the same sex.   Depends. Two men kissing is fine but I wouldn't really want to see them getting up to their private business. With women, I'd be quite happy to watch that all day.  Even kissing does bother a lot of people though, and I see that as being their own fault. Unfortunately, the majority of voters seem to be in this category. And democracy is founded on the voters wishes.   I don't get what you're saying here, and I have no idea what difference it makes considering what you want to watch, and what you don't.  Are there men/women doing their buisness outside you're home? or in public? I don't see alot of that around here, but who knows.

Jake. Really?  If you don't have anymore valid points then shut up!  "we live in a country of religious freedom... where religion has the freedom to oppress."  NOT FALSE... I am very oppressed by your religion. Because of your religion, I can't marry a woman.  If you don't make a valid point soon, you're going to look very stupid.

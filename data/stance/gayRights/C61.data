There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that sais that gays aren't allowed to be married. Or that marriage is between a man or woman. If gays are banned from marriage then what is that saying about our Constitution? Is marriage for heterosexuals put up for vote or discussion?? I don't think so. All the religious talk of gay marriage not being right is really on the back burner if you think about what the Bible sais about divorice, but I still see that happening, right? No matter what religion or group you belong to, the fact is, we live in a country that thrives on diversity.

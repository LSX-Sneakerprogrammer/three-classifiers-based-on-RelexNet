No, you don't understand what an ad hominem attack is. Insulting someone is not necessarily an ad hominem. Ad hominem is when you insult someone instead of addressing the argument in question.  I wanted you to understand your hypocrisy for criticizing Pineapple for not using accepted debating technique and then doing the same thing to an even greater degree.  How exactly did she falsely accuse the country of anything? She, along with anyone else who would want to, cannot marry someone of the sex due to the opinion of religion. I think that would qualify as religious oppression.   Oppression: unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power  A religion is unjustly exercising its authority by forcing everyone in the country to heed by it's teachings. Your church specifically I might add was primarily responsible for the passage of Proposition 8 due it's significant funding of an intolerant and fear-mongering campaign.   "I don't plan on adding a reason because it's so obvious."   I think this is your biggest problem. You accept everything your parents, priest, etc. tell you and don't even look for reasons because "it's so obvious."

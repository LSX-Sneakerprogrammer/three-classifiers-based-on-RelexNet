Where do we have a right to be happy? I'm only happy if I'm not poor. Does that mean I have a right to money because it makes me happy?   Everyone that is not hurting anyone else has the right to pursue their goals in life, and the things that make them happy. If you want money in life and you work to get it, and this is what makes you happy you are entitled to that. This is a right that you have, unfortunately a homosexual person in some parts of the world has no right to carry out their lives with the same dignity and respect awarded to a financial wizard.   Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date?   I do and so does a lot of other people, the fact of the matter is that some of the morals thought in a lot of religious texts are odious and out of line with modern understanding of humanity and our nature.   If person x believes God says gay sex is wrong, why would that change over any number of years?   It probably will not but the question is about Gay marriage and not sex.    Your dispute is that you don't believe God says that, but doesn't everyone have a right to religious freedom   Whether or not God said anything is irrelevant and i don't believe in God so I don't believe he said anything. Everyone has the right to religious freedom, a freedom granted that they respect other peoples rights and freedoms as well, including those of homosexuals to get married in a civil ceremony, one that does not involve any religious denomination, beliefs or rules.   And is it bigoted to say being gay is bad?If you believe fornication (sex out of marriage) is wrong, you believe that in all cases. If you believe gay sex is wrong you believe that in all cases. Does that make someone a bigot?   No, but it becomes so when you go out of your way to label and abuse Gay people.(The following are examples from the argument you are talking about)   You can call them butt-buddies, scissor-partners, bumchums etc. etc. but don't call them a married couple.    I need to come up with a new accurate word to describe you queers    Anyway cockmuncher........you're gay.    Faggot.   Tell me if this is the reasoning of a religious person or a bigot.   I'd be willing to believe you think murder is wrong in all cases, does that make you a bigot?   Are you seriously equating murder with homosexuality?   You are both arguing two separate points because you have two different life views.   Is this not the point?   While one of you is probably right, it does not necessarily mean that the other is stupid or bigoted to believe in something different.   Like I have said belief is everyones right and I am not in the business of disputing that, but it is not the right of the religious to force their opinions on any one especially when it has nothing to do with religion.

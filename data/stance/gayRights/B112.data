Everyone that is not hurting anyone else has the right to pursue their goals in life, and the things that make them happy.   Says who? There is no written protection anywhere in the constitution saying so. It can be inferred, perhaps, but it is not a guaranteed right. As such, the majority can vote on this issue any way they like until the constitution is changed in a legal fashion (i.e. the legislative branch).  Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date?   I do and so does a lot of other people   So? Who are you? Who are they? I can find just as many people (more probably) who disagree with you. Who says your morals are better than theirs?   a freedom granted that they respect other peoples rights and freedoms as well, including those of homosexuals to get married in a civil ceremony,   Again, says who? All of these rights and guaranteed freedoms are nice to talk about, but they just don't exist.   it becomes so when you go out of your way to label and abuse Gay people.   Yes. This is actually what I mean when I said the argument had degraded. The descent into name calling was very immature. Most of my very best friends are gay and I take real offense to comments like these.   Are you seriously equating murder with homosexuality?   No, I'm using the logic of something you believe to be wrong to show you how religious people feel. Did you know that many religions believe homosexual acts are only one step down from murder? Many religions believe God destroys whole cities if they permit homosexuality. But more importantly, this is an attempt to put you in their shoes and show one reason why they have a right to vote to make homosexual marriage illegal.   it is not the right of the religious to force their opinions on any one especially when it has nothing to do with religion.   They have a right to vote their conscious, and it has everything to do with religion. Do you have a right to force your morality on them and have their tax dollars support something they find to be a crime next to murder?

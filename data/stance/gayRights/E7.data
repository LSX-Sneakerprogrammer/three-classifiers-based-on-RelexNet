We have an overpopulation problem in the US. In the world, actually. Yes, homosexual couples cant reproduce in the "traditional" manner. That's one of their virtues in this society that encourages people to breed like rabbits, natural resources be damned.   And you're now telling me that this homosexual couple that is helping to keep the population down wants to adopt some of the population that was created and abandoned by heterosexual couples, and WE'RE DENYING THEM THAT?   Better no parents than good parents, is that it? If heterosexual couples were already adopting 100% of kids up for adoption then this "who will they talk to about this issue and that issue" bullshit might have a shred of credibility, but they don't.   I'm not adopted, but I bet its much easier to have the bird and the bees talk, for example, with an adoptive gay parent - of either gender, than it is to have that talk with the manager of the adoption facility.   I think gays have every bit the potential to be amazing parents that straights do. But seeing as how straight couples leave many children un-adopted, and seeing as how it's obvious you can be a horrible parent even when your ignorant little gender role is filled, i dont know why this issue even needs discussion.

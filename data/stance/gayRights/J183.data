I really can't stand downvoting and I would like to know the culprit who is responsible for downvoting my arguments. If you believe gay adoption is good or acceptable, then fine. I don't. I think being gay is not mainstream enough for a child to feel comfortable in a gay household. But fine, allow it. Then compare the children living with gay couples and the children living with straight couples. I'm positive there'd be a huge difference, psychologically speaking.  P.S. I have NOTHING against the gay community. I think it is completely natural. Society deems otherwise.

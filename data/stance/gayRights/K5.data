I concern is what's next? Lowering the age of consent to 10yrs?   Nothing comes next.  Science has observed homosexuality in over 800 species and counting. It is just a thing of nature that just occurs and it is completely harmless.  So what if they are born with estrogen or testosterone imbalances, they are hardly different from us.  Sadly, this society has this immature fear against them- no thanks to religion.

I would say raising children in such a fashion that we have a stable society has more to do with family finance, along with guidance and attention a child receives then whether or not the child is part of a nuclear family.   If your raised by one parent, and they bring home 80,000 a year by working just 4 hours a day(lets say their good with stocks), then lets say this person spends considerable time with their children; maybe he/she home schools them or something. That person would still be providing a good home, because the material, emotional and developmental needs of their children would be meet. If later this person gets into a good relationship, either with a member of the same sex or not; then the child needs would be even better supplied; and lets say this couple then wants to make it a triple and bring in a third person; even better for the kid right? This benefit continues for awhile, but eventually the needs of the group would overcome the means of supply; which means the group would become splintered(but still connected) and function more like a tribe then a family. Even that wouldn't be bad for the kid though, "it takes a village to raise a child".  Some homosexual couples adopt. gay marriage would allow for people to pool resources together better because of the financial incentives, meaning more stable families being more capable of adopting which would lessen the burden on foster care. There are many incentives to invest in homosexual marriage, i haven't came close to touching all of them here.

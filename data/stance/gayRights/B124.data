to me mate, all religions are just as silly as the last,  cause you know, thats a great mentality to impose on people  what your doing is wrong, your a abomination.   this can lead to mental stress and denial, since homosexuality is not a choice (backed by a thing called science). and i didn't know "being a man" required the ability to completely shut off logical arguments and refuse to think that you could possibly be wrong.

The logical fallacy is clear:  Theology X says Y  Theology X is True  There Y is true.  See how this is begging the question? Your conclusion and premises are pretty much the same:  Christainity condemns homosexuality  Chhristainity is the only source of true morals  Therefore we should condemn homosexuality.  Please provide logical, fact supported arguments.

Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with each other.    I never implied that.    As do I. But it is not right for me to dictate my SUBJECTIVE beliefs onto others out of some perverted sense of duty. That is absurd.   I believe this "belief" is truth and the truth must be said.   Who said homosexuals can't have kids? They simply cannot have them with each other   I don't find what you stated as a dispute. If it was intended to be one. if it was intended to be a dispute then you are wrong because when i stated "growing in numbers" i didn't meant adoption. I meant producing children into this world.   In one small sense, it is wrong to be homosexuals because you can't produce children. In that sense, it is naturally wrong. In another sense, it is right to be homosexuals because you can stop overpopulation. These are two contradicting statements showed by ReventonRage and RiceD. However, these statements are truthful in their own perspective. I understand that homosexuals can't have kids. They can adopt children and thus, support the advancement of the human race. Homosexuals, like non-homosexuals, can become scientists and mathmaticians that supports the advancment of the human race. Im just providing more senses in which being a homosexual is right.   You know what? I proved that facts can be contradicting. Homosexuals can't produce children and in that sense, it is wrong. However, they stop the world from overpopulation. In that sense, it is right. I know those statements are contradicting but i can't deny that both of them are correct in their own little perspectives.  Edit. If you read my other comments then you will already know that i think i went a little off topic with mine. I thought marriage meant having children so that is why i went into the discussion of children. Therefore, the discussion of children lead me to the purpose of life. If the author of this debate didn't meant marriage as in having children afterwards, then my comment should be dismissed. Ignored but not forgotten. lol.   It is contradicting. Im surprised myself. I said that a lot. However, i can say the same for non-homosexual people as well. They support life and they don't support life. Im just saying this so you don't imply that i don't think this.

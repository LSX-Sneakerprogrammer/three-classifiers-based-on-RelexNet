I have never bought the argument that by giving gay marriage a different name that you automatically lower the status of gay marriage.   I have never bought the argument that just by having a different word for gay marriage, that you are saying that gay love is less worthy.  That type of stupid reasoning is what has allowed political correctness run amock. If you call a retarded person mentally challenged, it doesn't automatically change the way I perceive the person. By calling the person retarded, it doesn't automatically make me see him as less of a human being.   A rose, by any other name, is still a rose.   If it is not obvious to you that changing the definition of a word cannot change the perception of a bigot, then you are an idiot.  Have a nice day ;)

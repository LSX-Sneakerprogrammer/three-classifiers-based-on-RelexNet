Gay marriage does not hurt anybody, nor does it affect any one around them! In the old testament Samuel II 1:26 it says,"I am distressed for thee. my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women." This is a clear indication that King David had a gay relationship and to say otherwise is naive.

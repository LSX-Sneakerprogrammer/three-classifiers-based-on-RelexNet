Yet you dodge "dancing."   I do not dance. There is no logical purpose to dance.   Then happiness, anger, sadness, etc... are all illogical as well.   Of course. That is why I have spent years ridding myself of emotion - indeed, ever since I was a young child.   It would be logical for someone to do something that is pleasurable become it makes them happy.    Happiness is both overrated and illogical.   The only people I'm aware of that find emotions "illogical" are psychopaths.   I've long thought myself to belong to that 'persuasion', though aveskde disagrees.   They might be able to give you a reason why having human rights is pleasurable.   Ahh, so you are one of those humanoids who believes that humans actually deserve rights. What about animals?  Rights are overrated.

Support for same sex marriage is growing rapidly and it IS only a matter of time before it is legal in ALL the states. I believe it is mostly due to the younger generations such as myself. Older generations were mind-fucked into believing many things were "OK" such as slavery and even after that was abolished racism was practiced in many households. as I'm sure after Gay marriage is legal there will be many homophobic households. Its like someones Dad being a racist and 20 years down the line they find themselves spurting a racist comment and catch themselves not even believing their own words. It was forced into their young minds. Younger generations have been increasingly allowed to explore their OWN beliefs the result of which is increased support for things that older generations were protecting out of tradition. Just because something is tradition doesn't mean its right.

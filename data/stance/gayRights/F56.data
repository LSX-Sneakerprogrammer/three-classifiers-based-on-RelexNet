Since a ritual that binds two people together as life-mates has absolutely no harmful effect upon society, and since romantic love is regarded as a good thing, I'd like to know why disallowing gay marriage is a good thing.  If it's not harmful, why outlaw it? Because you're squeamish? So, you'd let your squeamishness prevent two people from performing a ritual that harms no one and only strengthens their relationship? What kind of immoral douche are you to allow mere squeamishness to let you do something so selfish?  Except, of course, people against gay marriage would say I'm wrong. Though I'm not. They are all just squeamish, and they use pointless excuses to try and reason away that they're just squeamish. But really, they're all just pointless excuses for you to justify your selfish behavior of wanting to stop people from loving each other to their fullest potential.  Shame on you.

Okay, fine.   "If you don't have anymore valid points then shut up!"   No. I will under no circumstances shut up, at your command. And it's still belligerent. Because regardless, you  where  telling me to shut up and  assuming  that I didn't have any more valid points.   And don't say that you where not because if that was true you wouldn't have said any of that.   "If you don't make a valid point soon, you're going to look very stupid"   I don't care what your opinion of me is. Is this getting through to you? At all?    "And I'm not accusing the country of everything."    I didn't say that you where. The key word there is  everything . It sounded to me, (forgive me if I'm wrong) that you where blaming the U.S. for letting religion oppress people. If you where, then you are wrong.    "Because they spent millions of dollars to spread lies about the California constitution, schools, Obama, and a lot more."   What lies? I want you to tell me in full detail  exactly  what lies my church spread about all of those things that you so  boldly  stated. Go ahead. And prove that they are lies.

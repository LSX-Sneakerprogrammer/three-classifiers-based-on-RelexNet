What are you talking about? If the age of consent is raised or lowered it does to have a direct bearing on the legal definition of consent. The legal definition changes to the new age.   You're conflating age of consent law with the definition of consent in law. With age, it's not the definition  of consent  that changes, it's who is permitted to give the legally defined consent that is changed.

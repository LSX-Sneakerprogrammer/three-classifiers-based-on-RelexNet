I'm not telling gays to stop fighting for equal marriage rights. I'm telling them to take a different tactic. If you say that they are already doing that, then great.   Third: Why should we cater to those who are being intolerant of people's lifestyles?   Why should they carter to gays who are intolerant of their belief?  By  forcing people  who are against homosexuals to actually confront homosexuals, there is a good chance a fight will break out. You claim that it is wrong for people to  forcing gays  into a situation where they can't get married but you have no qualms about  forcing people  into accepting gays. WTF, soccer? If forcing people into something they don't want is wrong, then it's wrong. It isn't wrong for one group of people but OK for another. You can't have your cake and eat it too.  My point is that it is wrong to force anyone into anything they don't want to do; period. My solution is to go around those people. Not force them into doing it my way.  And again, WHAT RIGHTS? A piece of paper that says you're married? Benefits? If you want benefits, fight for benefits.   Sometimes the laws need to come first, and then popular opinion will follow... especially on issues that deal with civil rights   You can't legislate morality. That's the part that drives me up the wall. Someone telling me that something should or should not be legal because it is or isn't morally right. Sometimes the person talking to me about morals is an atheists or is pro-abortion. It drives me insane. Who are you to dictate your morals to me? You don't want me to dictate my morals to you. Why is it a one way street with you?  Just because "gays want to get married" does not make it  a right , nor does it make it  morally right  (or wrong for that matter), nor do gays necessarily suffer if they don't get to marry.  The fact that "gays being allowed to marry doesn't hurt anyone" is not a logical argument for gay marriage because I can just as easily say, "It doesn't hurt anyone if gays don't get married."   There are savages living in the bush that don't know from marriage as we know it. They live together, do what comes naturally, and that's that. they don't have a piece of paper that says they are married.  If a gay couple do not have a piece of paper that says that they are married, how are they hurt? They are not hurt. They just don't get "extra" benefits. If I have a piece of candy and you want it and I don't give it to you, you are not hurt, you just don't have a piece of candy, you don't have something extra, you don't have something you didn't have to begin with. So how are you hurt?  Now, if I take something away from you, then you have a legitimate gripe. These marriage benefits are not taken away from gays. These marriage benefits are just  not given  to gay couples. If gays want those benefits then fight for those benefits. But don't give me some sob story about how gays are hurt because you aren't given something they want.  Oh, but they want the same thing as heterosexual couples. Hell, I want a million dollars. CEO's get a million dollars all the time. Am I hurt because I'm not given a million dollars? Am I right in asking for a million dollars? I never had a million dollars before. Do I have a right to a million dollars? Am I suffering? Does it hurt anyone if I were given a million dollars? Why can't I have my million dollars? Maybe I should just figure out how to get a million dollars on my own. WOW!!! What a freaking concept!!! I have control over getting a million dollars!!! And I'm willing to bet every penny of it that once I get it, it wont necessarily make me any happier than I am already, right now.  This crap about wanting to express their love in front of friends and family can be expressed without a legal piece of paper. If you want a legal piece of paper in order for it to mean something, go to a lawyer and have him draw something up. You want commitment? Then specify what it is you expect to get out of the union during and afterwords (in the event it doesn't pan out). Specify exactly what it is you are willing to give up during the relationship and afterwords (in the event it doesn't pan out). Then, if it doesn't pan out, come and tell me how happy that piece of paper made you feel.

all you got to say ha,i couldn't find more from you even if i wanted. before saying god said that and that and that,why dint you prove the existence of god at the beginning,then prove his capacity to say something then prove our capacity to understand him...and if god can talk to humans and we can interact with him that would mean he is no longer god because he loses hes main essence.

There is no "normal" anymore. The divorce rate is through the roof, a lot of people don't even bother to get married anymore before having children. Some kids have one mommy, some kids have two. Some kids have a mommy, and two daddies. Some kids have a mommy M-F and a daddy Saturday and Sunday.  Children aren't stupid. They are way more open to new situations than adults, and most children these days, and very understanding. The only reason a child would not be understanding is if their parents were telling them that homosexuality is a nasty dirty thing, and that Timmy's two daddies are evil.  And you know what?    IF A CHILD IS GAY, IT IS OKAY!   What would you do if you had a gay child?  Don't you ever ever ever tell your child it is not okay to be gay. That breeds intolerance, and hate, and frankly... disgusts me.

I don't know that I'd argue that it hurts everyone per se, but I definitely think there's something to be said for the argument that homosexuality hurts homosexuals. See, most of the opposition to homosexuality on the part of religious people isn't bred of hate, it's bred of love and concern that A) the homosexual lifestyle is inherently sinful according to the Bible and B) that there are certain health concerns, such as AIDS, which in the U.S.--despite gay-rights activists proclaiming, "it's not just a gay disease!"--is mostly spread through male-male sex or women who have sex with a man who also has sex with men. And also needle-sharing.

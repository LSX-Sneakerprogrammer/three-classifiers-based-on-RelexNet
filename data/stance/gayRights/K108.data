"That guy who was engaged then "turned gay" was already gay. Society told him he wasn't gay, that's why it took so long to figure out."  Lol, see again, I am flabbergasted that it is impossible for you to accept that someone might have an opinion different from yours.  "Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay."  One example of society telling someone they're gay? You! You just did! To Joe. If you want another example look at any showing of a gay person on a TV show. If you act like x you are gay.  "Please give me an example where society tells anyone to be gay."  The right to vote is being stolen in CA. Twice the majority of people voted to define marriage clearly and twice the homosexuality community has tried to overturn the will of the people by using judges. The pursuit of happiness is in the declaration of independence and not the Constitution. If this is the justification for the right to marry whomever you want, it also justifies everything else you can think of, so long as it makes the pursuer happy. There is no constitutional right to marry whomever you want. Every citizen is equally protected with the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. If you're gay, you have the right to marry. So again, what right are you being denied? Visitation rights are already granted in the state of CA, as are inheritance and all other rights of married couples, es per Gov. Davis in 2000.  "Really? So no gay person has ever been killed for being gay?"  African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers? Of course not. The fact that some nut-case has murdered a gay person before does not make everyone who believes homosexuality is wrong into a murderer. Are you in fear for your life often? If so I am sad, but I sort of doubt it, that's just not the way the world is anymore (in this country). Are you afraid to express your opinion about this topic? I doubt it. I am. If I tell people what I think, I LOSE MY JOB. That's why I post here anonymously :)  "The Mormon and catholic churches, but especially the Mormon churches, spent millions trying to deny a group of people a human right"  Marrying members of the same sex is not a human right. Sorry. Until you can show me what human right is being denied, I don't know where else to go with this. As far as the donations go, the Mormon church DID NOT DONATE A DIME. Neither did the Catholic church (I think, I'm not positive about them). MEMBERS of these churches donated to a cause they believed was right. They have the right.  I have no problem with protests. I have a problem with vandalism, violence, riots, assault, disenfranchisement, and attack of religious liberty (suing to remove tax exempt status of people who disagree with them). I was opposed to it when the homosexuality was attacked and mocked and derided; I oppose it now when they do the same thing to their enemies.

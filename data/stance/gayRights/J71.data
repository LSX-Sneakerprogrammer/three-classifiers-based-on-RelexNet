People, people, people. IT DOES NOT MATTER. All these debates about should gays adopt, do redheads have bad tempers, are most girls shallow, these are all the same kind of debates! Gays can adopt, straight people can adopt, bisexual people can adopt, anybody can adopt! It doesn't make a difference. Also, I'm not saying they SHOULD adopt, but that they can, and it doesn't make much of a difference.

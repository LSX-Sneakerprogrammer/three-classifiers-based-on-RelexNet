1a) First, spousal abuse is taken very seriously. Second, how in the world would two dudes getting married cause people to take spousal abuse less seriously? There's no connection there.  1b) Two men have vastly superior earning potential. Ok. So what?  1c) "The protection of spousal support" What does this even mean?  2) "now anything else is SOMETHING ELSE" Um... you've got me there... lol  4) I'm swinging nothing, madam. Gay marriage is not a right. Regular marriage  also  is not a right. Does that mean regular marriage should be illegal?  5) But religion  is  the reason people are saying no to gay marriage. I see no other reason to oppose it. I will admit that I do take some pleasure in f'ing with you :) However, I also feel strongly that gays should be allowed to marry and I am honestly trying to persuade you that I am right.  6) Divorce and gay marriage are two separate issues. I agree that divorce hurts people. But I still don't see how gay marriage hurts anyone.

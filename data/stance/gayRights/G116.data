What does it mean to have gay marriages legalized? Can anyone tell me?  1 - Does it give gay married couples certain legal rights  afterwards  they wouldn't otherwise have?   2 - Or is it about acceptance by society?  If it's 1, then it's easily solved by giving united gay couples the same rights after their union. Taxation without representation is a no no.  If it's 2, here's what I think:  If you love each other, what the hell does it matter what anyone else thinks? But if you really insist, let's have a look at the meaning of marriage to most people. And to do that, let's picture ourselves going to a wedding:  a) We see 2 people who we assume love each other very much and want to be with each other for the rest of their lives (it doesn't matter if it doesn't always turn out that way).   b) We also think that they will want to go on to have children with each other and watch them grow and then to watch their children go on to marry and bear them grandchildren and so on and so forth (it doesn't matter if it turns out they can't bear children).   This is what we picture when we think of a marriage, it doesn't matter if we're in a cannibalistic tribe deep in the Amazon jungle or citizens of India. Of course we'll also form opinions about whether or not they look like a nice couple (amongst other irrelevant things) etc... but in our minds,  a  and  b  above are  the main elements  to a marriage. So if I see a wedding between those below, I'll not think of it the same way:  - 2 people of retired age, or   - 1 of retired age and the other half that, or  - 2 children, or  - 2 people of the same gender,  - a human and something else not,  Sure I'll be happy for them and I will sincerely wish them the best in love and life together, but I'm certainly not thinking of their union the same way I think of a straight couple's union as outlined above. It is what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it.   About changing the meanings of words to be more inclusive? No way, if anything we should be even more precise when it comes to words. Dictionaries don't define words, people write dictionaries that define words (Mahollinger). So I propose to exclude even more when it comes to definition of words and in law, but tax money should be distributed without prejudice by the government so any legal rights afforded a straight couple after marriage should never be withheld from a gay couple after their union.

I don't know if you have kids or where recently in school but the government is hiring people to get to the point long before the parents even want to think about it. Most straight parents don't even explain this stuff to their kids anymore either because they don't care or because they say one word and the kid says 'Yeah mom/dad I know. Remember that paper you signed last week giving the school permission to teach me that crap? Yeah please don't go there.'  What about single parents? They do it by themselves and to be quite frank I would find it more akward as a single straight parent then a gay couple who don't find any atraction to that sex what so ever. So how bout you through that argument in a single parents face and see if you still have a face when they're done with you.

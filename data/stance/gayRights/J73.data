I've never seen an argument for "no" backed up by scientific evidence. You'd think they'd notice that, but morons take to bigotry like fat kids to cake.   1. Gays are not confined to rigid gender roles as straights tend to be. The "outsider perspective" tends to give LGBT's a more astute view of society, and a frankness that's rare in straights. Give me AN EXAMPLE of how two male parents would be worse than a man and a woman.  2. And no, it won't make the kid gay; There is no evidence to support that. There's also no evidence linking homosexuality with pederasty. There is no evidence to link gay households with problem children. Sorry, you're full of shit.  3. The adoption screening process is excessive. And that's awesome. It means the average adoptive parent is far less likely to be abusive or neglectful, and they are  guaranteed to WANT the child, unlike many straights .

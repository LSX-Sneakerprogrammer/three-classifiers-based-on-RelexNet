I don't think the religious world should have to alter their views on gay marriage at all. I think they should ignore it entirely. I don't think religions are outdated either. Christianity, for example, is based on worshiping a God who sent his  son  (male) to Earth and his  son  picked 12  men , the apostles to be his advocates. There were many more prominent men in the Bible, not because of today's society, but because men were higher than women in that time period. The time period has influenced many practices that remain today. Well that was a nice little side-track from the debate topic. :)

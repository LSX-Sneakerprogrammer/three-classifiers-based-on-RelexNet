Show me the difference between christianity and buddism in an orderly and organized fashion.  This might take some time but nevertheless i do wish to see what kind of mannerly and orderly fashion you have in mind that you want to show.  I don't mind mistaking the truth for hostiliity because clarity comes from chaos.  I rather learn things the hard way and of course with reasoning and proper understanding, i would'nt believe in god that is omnipotent and thats it i need to know and understand more about it.  Please do show me what your opinions are between these two religions.  I don't mind them being vulgar but i just need them to be understandable.  Whatever vulgar stuff there is i don't care and i can't stop you :]

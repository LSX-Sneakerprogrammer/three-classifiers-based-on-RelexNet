if 20 percent of children that are born are homosexuals means 80 percent are not ...the percentage cant be altered into saying the 20 percent will influance the 80 and there would be 100 percent homosexuals...tht is totaly absurd. the gay people will marry gay people and the straight would marry straight people as simple as that.allowing the gay people to get married wont alter the fact of their existance it will alter your conception of their existance. preventing same sex marriage is just like racisme,slavery,despotisme...do not ask for your own rights if you cant ask for the right of an other human.

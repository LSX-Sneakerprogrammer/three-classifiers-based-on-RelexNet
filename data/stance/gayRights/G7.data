Wow, that's news to me. I didn't know two sperms can fertilize or two eggs for that matter, amazing.  About rights, gays have the same rights as the rest of. They just choose not to exercise them. Were is the discrimination in that?  About involvement: If the state issues a license, gives tax incentives, sets up family courts and all the other benefits they extend; I think I would consider that involvemnt.   About my evasion; glad you liked it :) I am one of those infertile couples :)

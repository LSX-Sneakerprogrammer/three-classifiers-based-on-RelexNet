I'm not a clairvoyant, but I can make basic inferences. Let's see if you can follow the chain of logic.  In 2006 a law banning homosexuals from adopting was  overturned by the Arkansas supreme court unanimously . Then two years later the law was passed making it illegal for unmarried couples to adopt (and as you are aware from previous debates on the subject, homosexuals can't get married in Arkansas).  Obviously this will have an  effect  on more than just homosexuals, but the  intent  was clearly to circumvent the Supreme Court decision and keep homosexuals from adopting.

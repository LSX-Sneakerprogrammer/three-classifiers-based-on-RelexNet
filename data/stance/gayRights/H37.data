Let me put this to you in a way that you can understand.  Let's say for dinner tonight you want to eat chicken. Instead of you choosing to eat your chicken however, your entire state, including the millions of people who have never met you and will never meet you, vote on what you eat for dinner. Turns out the majority of Texans prefer steak. Are you upset? Well maybe you just have a problem with democracy.   I believe that homosexuallity is morally wrong and I don't want it in my country.   You know what...the KKK felt the same way about blacks, so at least your in good company.

"Minds are like parachutes, they only function when open."   If I blindly agreed with you would you be calling me closed minded?   People only seem to use the 'closed mind' argument against people they disagree with. That in it's self is pretty closed minded if you ask me.    "It being a 'sin' is irrelevant."   It may be to you, but it is not to me. Do you see how pointless this is?    "You are a product of brainwashing."   I can  assume  the same about you. You are young and for gay marriage/adoption. So I can assume that you have been brainwashed by the mainstream media. Just like you assumed me a Christian, of being brainwashed, ...because I'm Christian.   Don't call somebody closed minded and then make assumptions about their beliefs.    "And again, the bible is not meant to be applied to law. So YES, gays should adopt.   Well, yeah I believe in the separation of church and state but this is a democracy. I will vote based on what I want, and you can do nothing about it.    "And what is a family to you?    The Family: A Proclamation to the World   That is what I believe.   and by the way:    "I hope you don't have that picturesque little household with a white picket fence, with a mom and dad, and a Golden Retriever who brings in the paper, et cetera... because that would be weird."   Whats wrong with that!? The media must tell you that image is bad.    "Or for thinking that gay people can't raise children."   Hey, if it makes you feel any better. I think most gay people would make better parents than a lot of straight parents. Many people should not be able to adopt kids. I'm not singling anyone out.

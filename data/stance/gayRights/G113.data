That's right, ants are another example. We have red ants and black ants. The red ants are called Solenopsis and the black ants are called Lasius niger. These words are common among scientists that study ants. Your average person doesn't deal much with ants so they don't need to describe them any further than red and black. However, your average person does deal with couples in a relationship and therefore more descriptive words are needed.  Now, the fact that  you  think that is not a good reason means nothing. Who the hell died and left you as the person responsible for determining what is and isn't a good reason?

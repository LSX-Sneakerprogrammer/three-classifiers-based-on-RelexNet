Our country was not founded on YOUR set of morals and religious beliefs. We live in a pluralistic society in which many religious and non-religious practices co-exist. To enforce religious practices of a particular religion, would destroy any sense of  NEUTRALITY  the government may have regarding religion. You cannot ban something because it is against your religious beliefs because not everyone shares your religious beliefs.  the fact that homosexual activities are  already legal  makes it seem like homosexual activities are okay. Marriage isn't even part of that equation. I don't think there is anything wrong with homosexuality and what people do in the privacy of their own homes shouldn't be any of your concern.  Gay marriage is already legal in a lot of places and those places seem to be doing fine.  Nor are we in any danger of running out of people, the United states is one of the most populated Countries (#3 I believe) in the world. We have some 300 million Americans with no shortage in sight. If only China and India had more gays then they wouldn't be so over-populated.

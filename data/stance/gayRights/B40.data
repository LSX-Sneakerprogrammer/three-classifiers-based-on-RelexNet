I did not use a moral argument.   Of course you did. You created a moral conclusion "sex ought to only be for procreation, and marriage should only foster this" and built logic around it.   I did not use a moral argument. I used an argument based on the purpose of intercourse.   The purpose of sex is only one of many subjective criteria with which you can build an argument. Addition criteria are pleasure, social bonding, equality, etc. People choose from these and then make a position to defend.

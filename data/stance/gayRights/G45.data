In this country we claim to be the land of a free people, does it say land of the free for only all straight people? No it doesn't if we are a land of free people shouldn't people have a choice to love and marry to whom they wish to? how do we have have the right to tell people who they can marry? does being gay make you less of a American? Last time i checked no. If two males want to marry, or if two females wish to marry in this land of the ''free'' then whom are we to tell then no. and in all reality is it any of our business what two adults do with there love life?

This is a brilliant statement, and I have to agree with you on this.  I'm straight and currently have no defined religion (only one born of personal beliefs that has no name) but I don't see the problem with same sex marriage. For this, I use the same philosophy as in every part of my life: If what someone is doing doesn't hurt anyone else, they can keep doing it. Gay marriage isn't exactly killing anyone, people should put their effort into issues that actually matter instead of denying happy couples their right to be legally married.

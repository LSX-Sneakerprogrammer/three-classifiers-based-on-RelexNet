Hello,  This debate should be private. If you'll initiate a new debate that is private, I'll thoroughly represent the principles of my viewpoint within that format.  I perceive you are asking a legitimate question concerning my understanding of adoption; I care to only discuss the matter with you. (I'll explain more in the private debate)

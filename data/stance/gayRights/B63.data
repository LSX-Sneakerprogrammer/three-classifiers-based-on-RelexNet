I think that gay marriages should be allowed, so what if its a man and a man or a woman and a woman, we're all human and should be treated equally and have equal rights. If they are choosing to get married and let people know about it, then good for them, because it shows that they are who they are and they are proud of who they are. As long as they love eachother and as long as they are human who has the right to say that they cant get married.

It seems that the only real argument against gay marriage is because the bible says it is wrong. That is your personal belief and your personal opinion, don't force it on to others. The bible says homosexuality is a sin and you extend this to say that gay marriage should not be allowed. Fine, don't get married to someone of the same gender as you.  No one's forcing you to marry someone of the same gender. If your personal belief system tells you that it is wrong then fine, don't have same-sex partners. That doesn't mean you need to go around inflicting your dogma onto the general population.   Now, you cannot possibly say that it is immoral and then quote the bible.  Blind obedience to ancient texts is about as far away from morality as you can get.  The bible isn't a moral code just because it holds conservative view points.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------     If the bible really was a source of infallible morals, then it should be perfectly moral to:    Sell one's daughters as sex slaves  (Exodus 21:7-11)   Kill adulterers  (Leviticus 20:10)   Kill blasphemers  (Leviticus 24:10-16)   Rape women  (Isaiah 13:15-18)   Kill women, babies and children  (Isaiah 14:21), (Hosea 9:11-16), (Ezekiel 9:5-7), (Exodus 12:29-30), (Isaiah 13:15-18).    --------------------------------------- ----------------------    Morality should be something which can be discussed with reason, logic and evidence. There is no logical reason why homosexuality is wrong. By denying homosexuals the right to marry you are creating a second class of people; you are discriminating against them by saying that they are not worthy of long-term, legally recognised relationships, yet heterosexuals are.

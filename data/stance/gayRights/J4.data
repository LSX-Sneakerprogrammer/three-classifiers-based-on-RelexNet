I have actually never been given the ' birds and the bees ' speech from my mother or father. Even if a couple is homosexual they still know what the speech is I mean I have never heard it from my parents but I have heard it from other people and on TV. So what difference does it make that a couple wants a kid even if it is a couple of 2 males or 2 females. Studies have already proven that a child from a homosexual couple turns out the same as a child from a heterosexual couple.

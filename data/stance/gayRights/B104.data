Good so you agree that illicit sex is condemned by hinduism which means homosexuality is condemned.  Glad we got that over with.   You can label me all you want, it only makes you more of a bigot.   Oh no! I'm a bigot. I'm so ashamed and terrified. Faggot.   Are they? I don't find that at all.   And IM the one in denial.   Peodophobe, fear of children or dolls, genius.   Ohh you're being gay again....  So where are we?  Homosexuality is immoral since time immemorial  Homosexuality is condemned by 99% of all religions  Homosexuals are trying to make hetreosexual things their's i.e. marriage.  Homosexuals are gay.  You're gay.

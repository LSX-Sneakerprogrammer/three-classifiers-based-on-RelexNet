Trouble is that you can't reproduce. You're a dying breed. Good luck on changing human nature, it has remained unchanged after thousands of years. But let say you do "win" what then? Your civilization goes into negative population growth and dies out, just like every society before it. And the cycle begins again. People respond to tragedy by becoming conservative, gain peace, get comfortable, get lazy, get liberal and die off. Then repeat. That's human history in a nut shell and there is nothing new under the sun, Same old problem with new faces looking at it. If you think this question is a new one, think again. We are locked in a struggle of utter futility. Have fun in your march towards suicide, I've found the door.

"Evidence? Considering how marraige predates any recordable history I don't see how you can come to such a conclusion."  Sorry what? What is it you want evidence for? I'm merely pointing out that the world religions of today did not invent marriage.   I like how you have completely ignored important details, including the main point I was making.  Are you seriously telling me that you agree with those punishments, simply because it was a different time? You think people need death threats in order to not do serious crimes? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for executing murderers for example, but people that swear at their parents? People that don't scream loudly enough while being raped? Do you agree with this? Will you not concede that there are things in the bible that are wrong? Do you refute even the things said that have been proven to be false? Are you so commuted to the defence of a book that you have never read that you will try to harm other human beings because of things you have picked up from others?  It's clear to me from your last post that you have never studied the bible. The promise of eternal happiness is apparently not enough to encourage you to read a book. I would suggest looking up Jesus's actions before you make assumptions about his life. What is it exactly that you want me to take into account? Be specific. Actually do some research and tell me what you want me to consider. If you don't, then I will continue to base my opinion on Jesus from my own research, and believe me, he does not paint a pretty picture.  I have started to get the impression that you are an idiot. If your next response does not contain at least one intelligent sentence I won't bother replying. I am almost certain this will be the case, so enjoy living your ignorant life.

What a silly old argument. "Gay people have equal opportunity to marry...to a member of the opposite sex."  Here is an idea. Since you like equality so much, let's make it illegal for you to marry the person you love and only legal to marry who we say you can. Ya, lets give you the same "equal opportunity to marriage" as you want to give to gay people.  Sound like a plan?

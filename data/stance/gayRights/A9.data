They have every right to get married as anyone else. If they love one another, why should we have any say in whether they can get married or not?  So it isn't a traditional male-female wedding. Why do you care?  No one is forcing you to go, and quite frankly, I'm sure they could all care less about whatever opinion you have anyway.

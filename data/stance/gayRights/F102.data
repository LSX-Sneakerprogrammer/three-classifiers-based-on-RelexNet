I did not say Christianity invented marraige, I merely said it was their tradition, meaning they adopted it. (I am aware that other religions conduct marraiges, but seeing as thie debate involves mainly British and Americans I've just used Christianity as an example everyone would be familiar with).  Why would someone want to be married in the first place unless the specifically follow that religion? Gay people can have civili partnerships why do the  need  to be allowed to marry as well.

"if every couple in the known world for say went homosexual humans would thereby go extinct"  Right, and if every couple in the known world went to the movies, humans would thereby go extinct. Because, you know you can't have sex at the movies. Especially when it would be so crowded in the theater.  But I think you are on to something here. If people have same-sex relationships BUT don't make it a legal union, THEN the human race will be saved. But once we let one same-sex couple get married, then everyone will go gay!  For example, in the state of MA -- can't find any heterosexuals in that state now. Even the state Senator posed nude, which is, of course, gay gay gay. Damn that MA. The human race is now doomed.

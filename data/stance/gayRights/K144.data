Having said all of that, I know exactly how you feel because I too want something that I'm not entitled to and the courts keep on deying me.  So my arguments to you are like therapy to me because if I can create a well thought out argument against gay marriage, then I can use a similar argument to justify the court's decision to myself and this in turn eases the pain and resentment and anger that is within me.  So don't think too harshly of me. We're all in this together. We all have issues. ;)

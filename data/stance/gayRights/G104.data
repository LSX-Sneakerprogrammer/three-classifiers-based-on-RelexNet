What a load of pseudo-intellectual crapola. Changing the meaning of the word is NOT going to fix the problem.  Marriage is just a word. It means whatever society decides it means. Expanding it so that the definition shows acceptance of homosexual love will NOT magically make them be accepted by society as a whole. By failing to expand the definition, we are NOT collectively deriding gay love as unworthy. What a load of pseudo-intellectual crapola.

in case you havent noticed...  .&gt;  there are gay women too, i think they are called  lesbians .  coughcough  so, yeah,   1) marriage does NOT protect women. it gives men more control over them  2) women can marry other women too if gay marriage is allowed so there wont be a shortage of men or what ever you are thinking will keep the women from getting married.  3) people did say interracial marriage would hurt ppl, thats why black ppl werent even allowed to look at white women with out getting hung. you know, why back when black ppl were getting their rights?  well, same thing, different ppl. wich means   4) interracial marriage is very relevant.   5) if you are worried men hurt women, then why not let men marry men and women marry women? then the men will leave the women alone. DUH

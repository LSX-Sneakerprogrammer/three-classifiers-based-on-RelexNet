No, it makes no sense. I'm glad you find this amusing because I certainly don't. If you treat criticism as a joke, I have every right to assume that you're incapable of rational thought   So if i laugh to something that i think it is funny, im incapable to rational thought? Didn't you say, according to your logic, that emotion cannot be used as a logical arguement? I laugh because it is funny, not because it is irrational. And why do i find it funny because i know im right.    What do you mean by "already exists"? Is knowledge a brute fact?    No, it isn't a brute fact but it is a fact. My claim is google definitions. Like Newton's law of motion. He didn't create those facts, he discovered those facts.   Ok. I see that im a little wrong. Knowledge isn't always discovered, it is created. My mind was focused on facts like Newton's laws; fact that were to be discovered.    I have never stated that. You are putting words in my mouth, idiot. I have always maintained that overpopulation refers to the situation where the population exceeds the carrying capacity of the area. If you haven't read that when I've written it three times previously, then you are truly a pinhead.   I apologize. I see now the difference between "normal" and "exceeds the carrying capacity of the area." I was wrong.    A pointless analogy is the definition of a "false analogy". That is a technical term in philosophy. Obviously, you aren't trained in philosophy. That is still not an excuse for stupidity.   My scenario wasn't pointless. That alone doesn't even make logical sense. How can you say that it is pointless. It is a scenario. lol. And no, it is not stupidity, it is called ignorance. Everybody has ignorance unless he/she knows everything about everything.    I asked you to justify YOUR claim, not mine.   Claim about what? Claim why there is mostly homosexual females in my scenario? lol The scenario is what it is. There is no ways going behind it. Accept the scenario for what it is. And claiming why there is mostly homosexual females doesn't even make sense? I created a scenario; hence, there is nothing to claim.    Yes i have disputed you   Sigh. No you didn't.    Which proves that your command of English is atrocious.   You can attack me on my English anytime you want. However, attack me and still answer my question. This show the lack of your debating skills. And im surprised that you didn't answer my question.    Which is not your position.   My mistake. I meant that homosexuality can be beneficial AND not.    Which is exactly NOT the debate in question.   Sigh. I know. I stated this to you many times.

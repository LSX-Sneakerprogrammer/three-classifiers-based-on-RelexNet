Actually Hinduism and early scriptures on Buddhism do not place any discernible restriction on homosexuality. In fact, Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful. I can't speak for Islam or Judaism because I have no knowledge of them, so I'll skip over them. But that's not the point I want to make.  The meaning of the pursuit of the marriage between homosexual couples is in the desire to be seen as a legal, justifiable entity with the same freedoms that we heterosexuals take for granted. Why should this be allowed? Well, why not? Why does it seem as though the sanctions of governmental regulation is influenced by Christianity? The concept of marriage long predates most religions, including Christianity. Actually, it was established as a means to restrict the promiscuity of the couple, or group, as polygamy existed when it was established as well.   The problem is that regulations that are established now were molded by, and cater to, Christians for the most part. It is not the government's job to act as a church; it acts to preserve itself and the rights of the governed. Why would it be beneficial to have a government that imbues "unequal" rights to law-abiding citizens? Just to cater to religiously-uptight citizens who don't even have a particular adherence to the religion in the first place?

"Does the bible not speak of marriages before Christ was born?"    I merely stated Chrsitianity to begin with as it is the main religion of the countries of which most of the debaters here are from, if you look in later arguments I changed it to religion.    "Homosexuality is not against Christianity, for homosexuality is not an ideology but a description of sexuality, however some forms of Christianity are against homosexuality;"    The Bible clearly states that homosexuality is a sin, thus is you homosexual then you are against Christianity.    "Marriage is also a secular, governmental institution, and very few, if anyone is suggesting churchs be forced to do anything other than stop using their influence for violating basic principals of secularism. "    What is the point of marriage then if it is a secular, government institution?     "There are governmental privileged and rights granted with a marriage LICENCSE,"  *  For example?

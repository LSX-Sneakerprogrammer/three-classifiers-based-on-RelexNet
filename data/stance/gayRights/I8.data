You claim that the rights should be given, firstly the facts:  Marriages have benefits.   Your reasoning is extend them to be fair, but that's a fallacy: Why should the state give them costly benifits?   So what reason is there to allow them union? None! As my last argument proved the state sees marriage as a procreative type union, gays never form this union, and therefore the goverment has no reason to allow it. So basically what reasons should the state grant these people benefits? As they have no reason then your argument is a fallacy, x =\= y in this situation  For more info:  http://www.debate.org/debates/ The-State-the-goverment-has-no-compelli g-reason-to-legalize-SSM./1/

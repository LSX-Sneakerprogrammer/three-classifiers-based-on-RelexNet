At this point it seems you are being obstinate and wilfully obtuse.   Prove that homosexuality is natural.   Define natural. Regardless, Human beings are not and should not be governed by what is deemed natural.   It shows future generations what the world looks (or rather, looked) like, primarily before the advent of the camera.   It is impossible for that to be the reason for paintings before the camera, as the artists would not have known what a camera is or that it would ever be created.   Hedonism is not logical.   Why not? Pleasure is entirely logical. Conversely, a life without pleasure is completely illogical. Sex is pleasurable, and a life without that fails to conform to the primary compulsion of life - procreation. Regardless, humans are not logical creatures. We have emotions, none of which serve any logical purpose. Our society makes sex a taboo, which is illogical considering our natural urge to mate.    How are 'human rights' pleasurable?   This is implied by the displeasure of having none.

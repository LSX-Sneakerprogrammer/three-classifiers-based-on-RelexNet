gay people shouldnt have to choose a different word.  marriage refers to the union of two  souls   yes, generally from different genders, but if not, so what. a word is a word.  this isnt semantics. people need to stop saying "no, bc 'marriage' means a man and a woman"  when we say should gays be allowed to get "married" we mean, "should they have the right to be allowed official union"

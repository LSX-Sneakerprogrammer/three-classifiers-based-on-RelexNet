If sex produces kids then homosexuals should be having kids, unless something else is going on here.   Homosexuals can and do have children. All the time. It's not like they've suddenly lost their genitalia just because they're gay.   I'll bet you didn't read all 44 pages of the report because you missed the point.   I read enough of it.   I see no reason the state needs to get involved in a homosexual relationship but I can see a lot of reasons for a heterosexual relationship.   That's a silly way of putting it. The state isn't involved  in the relationship . It should be involved in ensuring that the rights and privileges granted to one group are not withheld from another. And that's in the constitution.   Your question misses the point.   Nice evasion.

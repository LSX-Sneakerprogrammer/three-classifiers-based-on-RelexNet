Wow!   Your right, I am not an authority. Just a parent as I am sure you either are or aspire to be judging by your passion..  That was an attempt to show that it was meant to be a light hearted poke at the wording.  But I am curious, why so intolerant? Why just jump right to the "authority" sarcasm?   Well, as long as we are at it, and as a non-authority...I disagree for the block! The differences go way deeper than trivial or cosmetic.  Women cannot pass masculinity to a male child. A boy cannot learn from a woman what it means to truly be a man just as two men cant teach a young woman what it means to become a real woman.     Two women cant do any better raising a boy to be a man than a single mother can, and we all know what that has done to entire generations of young men.   The damaging effects on children from the absence of a father in a family is well documented.   When it comes to the matter of masculinity its just not possible. Its not that its wrong...its just not possible.  Truly I am sorry. I didn't mean to step on toes. Just my non-authoritarian opinion.

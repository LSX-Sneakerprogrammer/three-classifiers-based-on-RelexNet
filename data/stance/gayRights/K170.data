Gay "marriage" doesn't hurt anyone in a sense that it threatens traditional marriage (that between a man and woman). I say "marriage" in reference to gay "marriage" because marriage is understood to be between a man and woman in the very sense of the term, as a religious term. Gay's should be allowed to commit to one another and in a sense assume responsibility that a husband and wife would.

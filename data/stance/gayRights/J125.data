First of all, i grew up in a Christianity based home, i got taught that liking the same sex is wrong and not part of nature. That if God would be okay with this, we would all be men or all be be women. But what of I have learned is to be opened minded. Most people really don't don't understand Christians, because they believe in a greater power. You say if God see's ahead of everything then why did he create man, since he knew how we were going to become. He knew but God test man, to see if man is strong to follow whats right, in the Bible sense. So really it shouldn't matter what religion you are it only matters if you have the best intensest for man kind and not take advantage of that fact. If a gay man or women want a child they have all the right too. They have a right to just like us, they are human, we are all human. Remember this is America the land of the free, maybe not all the way free but to a certine point it is, that's why other from other countries come to America. By the way i rather worry about criminals on the street and to have them in jail than if gays can adopt!

I don't know whether God exists or not. I think that question is impossible to answer because I think it is impossible for us to know anything about the stuff outside of our own universe.  Because it is impossible know anything about the initial forces that created the universe, it makes no sense to say that God was that force.   And even if we do assume that God created the universe, it makes no sense to jump from there to saying Christianity is right and all other religions are wrong.  This isn't just some personal belief. This is the only rational conclusion.

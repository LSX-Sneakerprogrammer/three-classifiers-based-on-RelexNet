Do you expect me to believe that YOU don't care about points? YOU, who do everything in your power to collect them so that it's at the point of being ridiculous! You tried to give me your points? Yes, right....when you know darned well that cannot be done nor would I expect that of anyone and least of all you!  I'm the one who started name calling? Please tell me you're joking! Outside of this argument between us, tell me who, what and where!  I am always interested in negotiating with anyone who will listen. Successful negotiations need two people to want to resolve something. Who do you think straightened out the terrible incident with repubgal? Yes, you bet I'm entitled, just as everyone else is to be treated fairly and like a human being. Those are things I'll never give up on. I'll fight it for me and I'll fight it for you and anyone else. That's a matter of record on this site and in my life. I could hate you but still stand up for your right to be.

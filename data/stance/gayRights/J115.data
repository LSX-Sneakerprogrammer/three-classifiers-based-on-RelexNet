I believe you are the person who changed the topic when you gave your vulgar thoughts on Christianity and those who believe in it very strongly. As to your points, they are highly suspect. Oh, now you don't practice Buddhism? Earlier, you did. My, oh my, things happen very quickly in Oz.  You were not showing the difference between the two belief systems, not at all. I do not believe you have the capacity to show them and present them in a mannerly and organized fashion. You are a "master" at nothing other than the smoke and mirror show.  I've been here for a fair amount of time and know a bit about the way people up vote and down vote. Never take any of the regulars here for fools...for if you do, you'll fall into your own trap and be the worse for it. You mistake truth for hostility and that will dilute any Karma you have obtained, if any.

The problem is that basing the meaning of a word on its historical usage patterns leaves no room for evolution. When the legal definition of marriage was first established, it was, as you say, based on the views of society at the time.  But the views of society can change, and word meanings change along with them. And our laws should evolve to reflect these new meanings.  There was a time when black people didn't legally count as persons. Not too long ago you could've made the argument that the word "man" shouldn't include black men because generally when the word "man" was used, people thought of white men.  I still don't see what's so horrible about tweaking a legal definition.

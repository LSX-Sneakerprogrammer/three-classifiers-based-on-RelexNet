'm not telling gays to stop fighting for equal marriage rights. I'm telling them to take a different tactic.   What you are saying is don't follow the legal process. I guarantee if they had listened to your advice from the start you would be complaining about how they  weren't  following the law (which you actually seem to be doing as well, ironically enough).   If forcing people into something they don't want is wrong, then it's wrong. It isn't wrong for one group of people but OK for another. You can't have your cake and eat it too.   By getting married gays aren't forcing anything on others. You could argue that allowing blacks to go to the same bathrooms and schools as whites was forcing racists to do something they didn't want.   And again, WHAT RIGHTS? A piece of paper that says you're married? Benefits? If you want benefits, fight for benefits.   Actually it's not me, but the supreme court that argued that marriage is a fundamental right.  source  Maybe you should check your sources before making claims that are demonstrably wrong.  So yes, homosexuals  are  fighting for rights. Not benefits, not to force their views on others...  rights .

Srom, I care about your well being. I would advise that you seek help immediately. I once had a friend when I was child, and he was the most devotely religious person I knew. I was okay with him, even though all he yammered about all day were passages from the Bible. Little did I know that the reason he cared so much about religion was because he had some sort of psychological problem.  To make a long story short, he killed himself.  The more I read the things you say, the more I'm worried about you.   No, I am not joking. Please go and find some help for whatever depression you are experiencing, and not from a religious pastor! From a doctor! They are the only ones that can really help you!

Well the fact that it's wrong to be gay in the first place...  ...why would you want there to be marriage?  The fact that marriage is a religious ceremony..  ...why would you bring something so immoral and irreligious into the picture?  You can call them butt-buddies, scissor-partners, bumchums etc. etc. but don't call them a married couple.

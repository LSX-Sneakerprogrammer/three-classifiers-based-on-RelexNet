"As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented."   First result on google: "The first country to allow same-sex couples to enter into legally recognized marriage was the Netherlands, effective in 2001. Since then, six other countries and seven U.S. states have followed suit, though voters in California revoked it through passage of Proposition 8." I wouldn't call that unprecedented. If you are going to make a strong claim such as something has never been practiced, you should be sure you actually know what you are talking about. Therefore as I said using traditional marriage as an argument against same-sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage.  And your argument about language was really just wordy, vacuous, pseudo-intellectual babble. Words and language change over time. This is a natural phenomenon. Cultures are not stagnant. Marriage used to be between a man and the women he bought essentially. Society changes. This does not equate to a destruction of language.   "What proponents of the phrase "gay marriage" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority."   You mean, just like interracial marriage? If you can't see the comparison, I'm really sorry.   "Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!"   Yes because the LGBT movement trying to gain civil rights is exactly like the Nazi regime.  I don't think you read 1984 very carefully if you think anything in it can be applied to being against same-sex marriage.  And I find no logical pathway for how same-sex marriage could lead to "a state of total decay and ruin." That's some class A fear mongering right there. Do you work for NOM?

"maybe"? even though there is tones of scientific evidence that shows it isn't a choice, and that it isn't a disease/ sickness / disorder (watch the video that Atlanta Esq posted near the top) your going to go with "maybe". and when a very large majority of the scientific community say being gay isn't a choice, and back it up with their "silly" facts, their probably more right then you when your argument is piratically "cause I'm right"

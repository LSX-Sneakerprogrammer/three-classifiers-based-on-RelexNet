What jstantall is saying is that gay people are allowed to marry people of the opposite sex and that they are thus not being discriminated against. Just because they chose not to marry people of the opposite sex is of no consequence because it is their choice not to exercise their right to marry someone of the opposite sex. They are not being discriminated against. :)

I can be in love without getting married, but I don't wanna. Why souldn't they want to as well?  Who am I to say to let them do things???  That dosen't make any sence. I believe no matter sex, skincolor and what sex you're into, shouldn't keep you from living just like anybody else.  Its normal to get married.

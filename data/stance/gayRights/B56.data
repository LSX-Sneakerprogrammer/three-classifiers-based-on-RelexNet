Marriage is not something you have to enter into just because you are in love. However, marriage is an act of love. It is supposed to mean that "I am proud to be seen with you", "I trust you with my belongings" and "I love you so bloody much that I don't want to share you with anyone else". Once again, I state that you don't have to be married to feel like this or be known to be like this, but a ring on the finger USED to keep other rivals away.   So why can't homosexuals marry? If heterosexuals can, why not they? Oh, if we are using the Bible as an excuse, I would like to say that we don't stone adulterers anymore and God loves us NO MATTER WHAT. He wants us to be happy.  By the way, I like gay people better. They can see things as they are and as what they can be. Close minded morons can't.

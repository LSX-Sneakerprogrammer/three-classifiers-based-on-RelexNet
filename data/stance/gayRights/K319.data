1st. . .the question is not is being gay good, bad or indifferent? It is about gay marriage.  For the record I have not one issue with the type, sex, number or racial, religious background of peoples bed, shed or head partners. Consenting adults can consent to anything.  So unless someone says "ew your gay!?" stick to the subject please and quit reading even more into the topic than you already are. . .  Sure let's use the analogy of the animal kingdom. Sure gay relationships abound. . .but how about a gay mated pair? And even so as animals is this going to function for them as a regular mated pair?

You also don't become gay from "influences from your peers and society." There is at this point more evidence that supports biological and genetic reasons for a person being homosexual. (Identical twins are considerably more likely to have the same sexual orientation, sexual preference can be changed in rats, fruit flies, and other animals with simpler minds, a gay man's brain has characteristics that look more like a straight female"s, and so on and so on.) However, sexuality is one of the most complex psychological processes of humanity and thus there is not a conclusive answer on the whole nature vs. nurture argument. So basically your statement is "unfounded" as well.

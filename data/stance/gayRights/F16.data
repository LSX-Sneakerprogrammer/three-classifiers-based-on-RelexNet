You can't seriously use a dictionary definition to argue against gay marriage, especially when the definition of words and phrases changes all the time.  Fact of the matter is, any modern society worth its salt is always changing. Fifty years ago inter-racial relationships were unthinkable, let alone marriages. Once upon a time marriage had more to do with status and family importance than anything else. The world will not collapse due to gay marriage and those who feel it will are ignorant of history.

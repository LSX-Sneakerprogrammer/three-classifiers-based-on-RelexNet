First of all, separation of church and state means that the government actually can't make Christianity or and other religion marry two people of any gender. If you'd like to discuss the Bible, what about the verse that says God hates clothes made of blended fabric? Hope that shirt you're wearing isn't poly-cotton! Or the one where it says you should never eat shellfish? Or the one that explains how a woman must be a virgin for her wedding to be valid? Half the marriages in America are moot there! I'm not even touching your second paragraph because it makes very little sense to me. If all you've got is a short from South Park, I think we're done here.

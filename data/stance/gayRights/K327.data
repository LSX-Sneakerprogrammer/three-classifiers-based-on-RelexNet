1. As far as I know marriage isn't for women to be whipped around and be told to make sandwiches, it is to spend the rest of your life with the one person (unless you're mormon) you love the most and to be officially united.  2. I agree.  3. I hate when people bring nationality and color into this. Sally Sue didn't choose to be white and she can't stop it without harming herself either. Todd James didn't choose to be black either. You people say "we can't choose who we love" but I disagree a bit. I don't think we were supposed to be falling in love with the same sex and if we do feel that attraction it is easy to stop it. This applies with any genders. We are born man or woman (minus a few genetic mutations), not both. There are two genders solely for the reason of reproduction, which is what intercourse was intended for. Not for enjoyment.  4. Again, why would you bring the amount of melanin in our skin (as our color is only an adaption of our surroundings) into a discussion about homosexuality?   5. Not all men are some raging savages and if a woman is stupid enough to marry a man like that then she may deserve that relationship. That isn't an excuse to "try something new" and fornicate with Mary Anne down the street.

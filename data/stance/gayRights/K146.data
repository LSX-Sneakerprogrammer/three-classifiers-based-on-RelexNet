Gayness is as natural as sex and food.  Treating people worse because of them being gay is like treating black or Asian or Indian people worse than others.  Except I've actually seen a black person change his colour (Michael Jackson), but I've never heard of a real story where a gay guy became straight (and not asexual or faking it trough whole life).

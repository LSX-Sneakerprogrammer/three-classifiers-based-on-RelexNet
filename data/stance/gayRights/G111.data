"Lasius niger"... hmm... that sounds like two words... kind of like "gay marriage".  On the rare occasions that we need to differentiate between different kinds of marriage we say "gay marriage" and "straight marriage". OMG, an extra syllable!  We shouldn't take away people's freedom to marry someone they love over an extra syllable. It's fucking common sense.

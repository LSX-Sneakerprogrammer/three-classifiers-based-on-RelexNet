I don't see why it shouldn't be permitted. Seems to me that the only reason anyone has that it shouldn't be allowed is that the "bible says it" but if we are going to base all our laws off of what the bible says, shouldn't we also be stoning people for committing adultery, killing children for disrespecting their parents, and not allowing women to teach, speak, or even think for themselves?  Seems to me like the opposition should take some time to rethink their position, among other things.....

This is an interesting topic because most people argue based on their emotions rather than rational thought. Before individuals start accusing me of being homophobic, homosexuality should be accepted as part of life however the raising of children in a same sex household has many questions unanswered.  Dr Albert Dean Byrd a well educated child and family pyschologist has researched this topic for sometime and he found that children throughout their developmental stages need a MOTHER and a FATHER.   He states  "Children raised in homes with both mothers and fathers navigate the  developmental stages more easily, are more solid and secure in their sense of  self and in their sense of gender identity, perform better in the school system,  have fewer social and emotional problems and become better functioning  adults."  He further points out the roles the Mother and Father play in the up bringing of a child.   "Mothers use touch to calm, soothe and to bring comfort to children. When mothers  reach for children, they frequently bring them to their breasts to provide safety,  warmth and security. Fatherâ€™s touch is most often described as playful and  stimulating, bringing with it a sense of excitement to the child."  The combination of these roles within a dual gender household clearly shapes the upbringing of a child. The selfish notion of same sex couples wanting to adopt a child or have a child through IVF, or a carrier should be treated with caution.

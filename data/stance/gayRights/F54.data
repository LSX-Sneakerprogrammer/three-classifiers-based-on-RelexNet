Yes it should. The principal argument of who doesn't want to the law allow that say that it's against the Bible. So, following that type of thinking, let's see what you probably doesn't follow AND is on it... 1 Corinthians 11:3     3 "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God."  1 Corinthians 11:7 - 9    8 For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.    9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.  Esther 1:22      22 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that [it] should be published according to the language of every people.  THE BIBLE IS SEXIST! GO SEARCH IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. NOW, ANSWER ME, DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS? DOES THE LAW AGREE WITH THIS? DOES THE SOCIETY IN THE GENERAL AGREE? SO WHY A MAN CAN'T MARRIAGE ANOTHER MAN AND A WOMAN CAN'T MARRIAGE ANOTHER WOMAN? ANSWER ME THAT.

I don't support number one because it means that the rights of the opponents of same sex marriages are being trampled on   - less so than any of the other civil rights battles that have ever been fought - when it comes to equal access to the ballot, the opponents could at least say their votes would be diluted by expanding the pool of voters - in this case the rights of the opponents will not be diminished in the slightest.    I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights   do you believe each state should have the right not to recognize any marriage - for instance the states that had laws prohibiting interracial marriages?    the word marriage has a religious aspect to it    Actually, I would contend that this is a very widespread misconception. Marriage is actually just a social arrangement. Many religions have tenets related to marriage, but marriage can exist completely outside of religion. The government doesn’t (and shouldn’t) use any religions rules as the arbiter of what is acceptable in terms of marriage (we do not have laws requiring dowery, or that fathers of wife’s who could not prove their virginity pay the husband 50 sheckles, or that wives obey their husband as if he is god, etc.) We take our morals and our common sense and our constitution and some to a consensus on what should be legal – e.g. we allow divorce for more than just adultery because we found practical cases for divorce other than adultery (spousal abuse, etc.)    Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so   The right to be treated equally under the law is already being denied. Equality isn’t being denied because people are talking about it – it is certainly the opposite.    If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again   Equality under law is more than just a piece of paper – social security benefits, health care, tax and court treatment, etc. – gays are taxed equally but receive less in government benefits than heterosexuals.

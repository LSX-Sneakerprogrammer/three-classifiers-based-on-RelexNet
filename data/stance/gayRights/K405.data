"Who says your definition of family is correct?"   Well, ha, alot of people, including the majority of California.   "You think that two people who love each other should not be able to adopt merely because they are the same sex?"  Merely because I think that is not how kids should be raised.   And im not a big fan of single people adopting.  Im not saying that they are less capaple, im saying that its not good for the kids.

The difference between getting the wrong drink and allowing gays to marry is that getting the wrong drink has a direct negative impact on your life   The "drinks" analogy was used to explain why we shouldn't go around changing the definition of words. This does not mean you can't get an OJ whenever you want. You're free to get OJs. No restrictions on getting OJs. Drink OJs until you get OJ poisoning if you like :) But don't get an OJ and call it a lemonade and then expect others to accept that. Of course you're free to call an OJ a lemonade amongst yourselves. That's how you should relate the "drinks" analogy to gay marriage.  .  Gay marriage doesn't harm me in any way and I've never even come close to saying that anywhere, so please don't think that.  .   Allowing gays to marry doesn't impede straight marriage in any way   It wouldn't impede directly, however like I explained, it will alter the idea of marriage. We were talking about the idea of marriage and I simply don't want my children to be confused about that idea and what it means. That's why with the rate things are going now (all kinds of unions are included in the idea of marriage), I'd even like to restrict the definition, not expand it.

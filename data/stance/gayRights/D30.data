Gay marriage and homosexuality aren't quite the same thing, just as how straight marriage and heterosexuality aren't quite the same thing (e.g. a gay man can get married to a woman, but that wouldn't magically turn him into a straight man), but that's not the point I was trying to make. What I'm saying is that providing Biblical evidence will only help you to convince Christians. Non-Christians won't see any reason to ban gay marriage just because the Bible says it's wrong.

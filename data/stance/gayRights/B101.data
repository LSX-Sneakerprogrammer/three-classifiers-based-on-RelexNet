The link you posted?  Kind of bullshit. Ever watched Scrottie Mcboogerballs? South Park where it shows how people read into things that aren't there?  Hinduism is a tolerant religion. If things were like they should be or like the old days then I'm sure homosexuality could be tolerated. But things are not. Gays are constantly in your face sticking their sins into your face. Justifying their sins. Making others accept their sins. Legalising their sins. Trying to make gay marriage and then legalise it etc.  If there wasn't any of that bullshit... with men sitting on each others laps in public etc. I don't think I'd say a word and let them be. Instead they're trying to get me and other people to allow them into our daily lives. Fuck that. Action = reaction. I'm not going tolerant on that.   are you suggesting that I am afraid of children?   Lmao wut????  Anyway cockmuncher...  .....you're gay.

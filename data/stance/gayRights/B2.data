What exactly is love? Do you have a pet? If your pet was in the "Vet" and you couldn't visit them, give them friendship and comfort them in there time of need, then would you do anything you can so you could? If two people love each other, then "The genitalia between"there"...legs shouldn't dictate with whom..."they" can spend the rest of there life..." with.

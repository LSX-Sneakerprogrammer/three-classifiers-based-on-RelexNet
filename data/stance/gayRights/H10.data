I do not at all feel as God wants two men or two woman to be together, as he has made each a man and a woman to combine and be together. However, it is our constitutional right to make our own chices in America. What I believe should be "exit only" is non of my business where people put things. As far as a legal bond, we are considered "one nation under God" but , the goverment would make a benifit from gay marriage, wether I a gree or not. Like I said we should have the freedom to choose, we are Americans and our ancestors fought for our freedom!!!!! Hey and I hope everyone is fighting to keep seatbelts a choice,please keep fighting for our FREEDOM of choice!!!

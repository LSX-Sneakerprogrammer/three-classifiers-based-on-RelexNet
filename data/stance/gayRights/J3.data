Why should I care? Explain one reason why I should care, as I said above, if the kid comes out okay, and is taken care of? People come out of single parent, and single-sex, relationships just fine. I say go ahead. I do not think I am so high and mighty that my own opinion justifies the rule of behavior for a whole section of society. I am just not that self-confident, I guess...  But, I'm getting off subject. It's not my place to care. The "birds and the bees" get explained just fine to boys and girls that never had the opportunity to have mothers or fathers. And I think you know it, Bill.

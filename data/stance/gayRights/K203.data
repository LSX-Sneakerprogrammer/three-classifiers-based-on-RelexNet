"Gay marriage destroys marriage and traditional values, and that's why it's a great thing."  this is why the prop 8 passed.   on the one hand. . .you all want the white picket fence  on the other. . .it sucks and we are freakin' stupid for buying into it. so why do you want that which you claim to hate?  as a married woman with children I have been called a breeder on various women forums. and the concept that children are merely excessive consumerism run amok that they hate seeing in their daily life. this idea was put forth many times by women who thought my being married, to a man no less was pretty much the same as me tattooing slave on my forehead.  I accept you for who you are. why do you want to be me? and if you want to be me why the disdain for my choices?

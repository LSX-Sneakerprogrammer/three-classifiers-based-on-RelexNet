Well, segregation is kind of a bad word. It's not the same as that situation with race and education in the 60's.   Marriage is in most places, defined as a man and a woman. So the best thing to do is create civil unions. It's really simple actually.  Why does a different name make something un-equal? Whats wrong with civil unions? It's not like those black kids in the 60's who had to go to poor crappy schools. I repeat;  it's not the same.

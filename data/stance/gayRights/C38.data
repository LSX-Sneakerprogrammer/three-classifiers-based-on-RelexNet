Should your state decide if YOU can marry who you want? Did the Supreme Court go too far when it overruled state's laws against interracial marriages in 1967?  What happens to the federal benefits/responsibilities of marriage (social security, tax implications and filings, exemption from testifying against spouses in court, child support, etc.)?  And if a gay couple adopts a child in a state where gay adoption is legal then moves to (or vacations in, drives through, etc.) a state where gay adoption is illegal, are there custody rights put in question?  Or, a lesbian couple who gets a civil union where it is legal, has a child by artificial insemination, and one spouse takes the kid to a state that does not recognize their union (based on a real case), what are the other spouse's rights?  Marriage is a good example of where a different law in each of the 50 states is a terrible idea.

Yes Rafael...you hit the nail right on the head when you said that "everyone needs a state of belongingness." and "I think this is what they were all after." You betcha. The state of belonging, the state of acceptance for who and what kind of person you are, the state of matrimony which is a sacred trust between two people...And even though they cannot have biological children they can adopt a child, have artificial insemination anonymously or by someone they know.

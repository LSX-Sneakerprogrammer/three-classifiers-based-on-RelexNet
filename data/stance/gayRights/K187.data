I think that it hurts people's sensabilities if anything, but the amount of adultery and divroce hurts mine. Adultery is immoral, yet that fact isn't stopping anyone. I think it is that individuals choice. What if straight people are simply getting married simply for the benefits, but no one is taking away their choice to get married.

Personally, I think love is equal, whether is in the form of a man and a woman, a man with a man, or a woman with a woman.  Not to be judgmental, but one Christian belief is that God loves everyone, we are all his children.   Then when you turn on the TV, you see the very same people who believe that God loves everyone start riots about the gay marriage law passed. They keep saying that being homosexual is a sin, and an abomination.   As a wise man once told me: That issue is between that person and God. Its not our job to tell people what they should and shouldn't do with their life. If that person has sinned, then let them take it up with the Lord himself.  I'm not trying to be biased about the Christian faith, just the two things seem to go hand and hand with each other.

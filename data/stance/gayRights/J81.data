To say that two men or two women necessarily can't raise a child as well as a one-man-one-woman couple is sexist and inaccurate. We all know there are some heterosexual couples who are clearly unqualified to raise children. Restrictions on adoption should depend on the individual circumstances of the adopting family, not on generalised statements about the differing parenting styles of men and women.

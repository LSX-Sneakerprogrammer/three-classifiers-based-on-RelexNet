2. There is a huge difference between supporting gay marriage and supporting man marrying an animal -animal has no voice and can't give a concent. A person should only be able to marry another being that can give a concent -that simple. Both sides must willingly agree to be married -impossible to achieve with animals. So this should help you feel more secur -this will never happen just because of that.

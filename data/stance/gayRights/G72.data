Actually gay marriage exists in a number of states [see my picture for exactly how many]. Prop 8 was only in California.  As far as civil unions, I think it's a good first step (many states don't recognize  any  union between homosexuals) but separate but equal, is inherently unequal, and marriage is a fundamental right (this isn't my opinion, but was decided unanimously by the supreme court).  I am very glad though that you decided to keep religion out of the equation.

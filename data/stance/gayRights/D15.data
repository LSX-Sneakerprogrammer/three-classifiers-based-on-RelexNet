It is retarded to even vote to allow gay marriage or not. I support it but there is no reason to be against it. To me, it is like if my mom stops me from eating fruit loops and say: "Gay marriage is now legal." I will be like "who cares?" and look at her in weird way. lol  Im not negative towards the issue at all. But it is stupid to discuss it when it is obviously it is the right thing to do to allow anybody to get married.   This is what makes us ignorant to even have to vote to make it legal or not. Make it illegal and i will be dissapointed. But the fact that we have to vote when it is obviously right to allow it is pure ignorance. Sorry no disrespect. :)

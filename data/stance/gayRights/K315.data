i agree, this cannot be "evolved" though, i do think it is genetic (will talk about this next).  cant be evolved because- according to darwin, we (animals) evolve so that we can survive and have stronger offspring. gays cant have kids, therefor, why would they have "evolved" into being gay?  is genetic - see my previous arguements

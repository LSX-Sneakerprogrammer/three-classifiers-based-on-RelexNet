Religion is a large part of many of our country's laws. If you live in America and don't like it then move. If you don't live in America respect his/her opinions. Not just religion goes into it. I find watching two homosexuals making out like a normal couple in a public place disturbing and sick. I know many probably feel the same about straight people but that's just my opinion. Plus, I think it would really confuse children to see something like that.  I'm against homosexuals and homosexual marriage but I believe such things are out of my hands and I shouldn't be violent or insulting with such things just because.

Gays folks should not adopt for a very simple reason. No American baby, adolescent, toddler, teen, or adult (young or mature) would receive the proper nourishment, values, or knowledge with same sex parents. Also, the Man upstairs made it possible to procreate between a man and a woman. Don't you think we ought not argue with the creator of all things?

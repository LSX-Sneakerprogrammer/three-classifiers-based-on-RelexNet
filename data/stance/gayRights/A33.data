Wow. A contradictory statement within the same breath? What do you mean when you say "homosexuals are not wrong"?   It is contradicting. However, my argument still stands correct. Before i go ahead, this is all opinionated and this is what i believe is the "truth."   I thought it was clear when i stated that homosexuals are not wrong. What i meant was, in a simple perspective, that being a homosexual stops the advancement of human growth and advancement. This perspective is not being able to produce children.  The truth is contradicting. Evidence that supports the previous sentence is the fact that homosexuals stops the world from overpopulation. This is another perspective that makes being a homosexual naturally right. This evidence supports advancement of growth by controlling growth. That too sounds contradicting but if we overpopulated, then it may be hard to sustain life. If we can't sustain life, then we can't advance the growth of humans. Now, i am not too educated in all the problems that may happen due to overpopulation. However, i do think it is bad to use up most of earth's resources. We need earth's resources to sustain life.    Knowledge is simply belief on the basis of strong/over-whelming evidence. To say that you "believe" in anything in a debate amounts to saying nothing at all!   I understand what you are saying. However, you implied wrong. I believe that is this knowledge/truth because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument:   1. Fearing the tip blade touching our heart because we don't want to die. (lol i said blame)?   2. We go to school to better ourselves.   3. Not wasting my life playing on my Nintendo Wii if i had a billion dollars.   I believe morality plays a part of evidence that supports the purpose of life (I can be wrong about this) :  1. Killing one or multiple people of your own race, human race, is wrong. Why do we hate or cringe our face at the thought of killing one of our own? I believe (but i think it is face on some levels) that it is wrong because killing your own kind is against the purpose of life.   However, this is contradictory. This is contradictory because we had World War 1 and World War 2. We kill our own kind in that race. However, i think that the truth can be contradictory. We had to fight in World War 1 and World War 2 to sustain America's advancement of growth.......I not to intelligent in history. However, i believe one of the main reason to fight in war is to not let other people control us. Excuse me and correct me if I'm wrong.    How are any of these analogies related to whether homosexuals should or should not get married?   hmmm. I stated this before in another person's comment but i believe i went off topic with my entire comment. When shadowwolf stated that men and women should fall in love, i took it as that men and women should be attracted to one another. That is why i went into the discussion of children and the purpose of life. I went into that discussion because the purpose of life is supported when men and women have children. If the author of this debate didn't imply "producing children" to "married" then my argument should be dismissed entirely due to the fact that i went off topic.   I'm not realizing this mistake.

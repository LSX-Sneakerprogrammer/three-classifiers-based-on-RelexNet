wow - so many things wrong in so few words.  ever hear of a "marriage of ideas" marriage can be any union, even in the dictionary  moreover - should the dictionary dictate policy??  the founders said that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion - what part of that means what the bible says goes.  not to mention what the bible actually says about marriage  the new testament specifically says it is better not to get married at all 1st Corinthians Chapter 7, and not to allow for divorce except for infidelity (and marrying someone who has been divorce makes you both adulterers).  The old testament is  WAAAAAY  worse (and the new testament says not to ignore the old one  http://www.evilbible.com/ do_not_ignore_ot.htm)  )

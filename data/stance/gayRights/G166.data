You seem very knowledgeable about this so tell me.... How is the gay marriage thing similar to the black community's fight for civil rights back in the 60's? I mean, I haven't seen any footage of gays being hosed down with fire hoses or beaten with batons or any such thing. I have, however, seen gay pride parades but none of those people are thrown in jail (although there are some who should be charged with indecent exposure, but that's a debate for another day ;).

My concern of what is next is a plausible question. This is obviously an emotive topic for you, but you need to do your research, especially on the age of consent. Yes, the number of species observed with homosexual tendencies is vast, but does this makes it moral, ethical or "completely harmless"? Who draws the line when it comes to patterning animal behaviour? Moralism and morality are opposites and thus there should be no confusion with each other. I am not homophobic but do have a phobia for lies being portrayed as truth, and I also have a plausible fear of the impact of these positions would have on your society. Heuristics as scepticism should not be a resting place for critical thinkers, hence considering the outcome (“what comes next”) of this revised moral position on your society should not be so offensive to you.

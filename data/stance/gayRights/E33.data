Are you for real? In what way would their life not be fair? They've still got two parents who love them, just like any other couple out there, gays should have all equal rights as a straight couple does. there is NO differance, except the same sex. And there is absolutely no possible way that simply being RAISED by two gay people will make someone turn gay... you can "turn" gay. its biologically programmed into you.

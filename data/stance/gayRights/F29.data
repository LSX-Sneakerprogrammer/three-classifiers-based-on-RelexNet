there is no such thing as gay rights   There most certainly is.   everyone has the same rights no one has different rights than others.   So why on Earth are you arguing against gay marriage (you're on the wrong side, by the way).   Marriage is defined as between a man and a woman,   This was pointed out to me by Liber. You are right in saying that marriage is between a man and a woman, but only because the word structure necessitates it. And I think we'd live in a boring world if we didn't stretch definitions and rules every now and again.   with one of the main purposes being to procreate and have children,   Find me a single dictionary that says this.   once you take that ability away there is no way it can be a marriage.    So the infertile can't marry?   This does not include those who just can't have babies because of sperm count or medical reasons   On your definition, it does.

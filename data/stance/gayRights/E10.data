Why the hell shouldn't they? My friend was raised by two gay guys, and he's the straighest man I know! It's not something that "rubs off on you", for gods sake people. Infact, he had the coolest parents I know! Every single person in this world deserves the same equal rights as the next, no exceptions. We all need to except that.

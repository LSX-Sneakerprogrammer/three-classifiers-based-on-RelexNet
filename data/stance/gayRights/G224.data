No you misunderstand what I said I meant that there is nothing wrong with being different and that its normal to have problems either mental of physically and nobody needs shots of any hormones. (wouldn't work) Also it doesn't matter if they want to have sex they are obviously not going to go right in front of you and do their business. So like I said stop paying attention to those really stupid details... you're obviously one of those ass hole guys who find it ok for two women to make out and two men can't. If a man is born with all his essentials than HE IS A REAL MAN! Pretty sure gay guys have junk in there pants just like you do. They bleed red like you do and they pee, eat, burp and pass gas like you do!

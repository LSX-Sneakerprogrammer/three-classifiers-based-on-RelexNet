Well the fact that it's wrong to be gay in the first place...   Why?   The fact that marriage is a religious ceremony..   Definitions of marriage  A: the social institution under which a man and woman establish their decision to live as husband and wife by legal commitments, religious ceremonies, etc.  B.a similar institution involving partners of the same gender: gay marriage.  2.  the state, condition, or relationship of being married; wedlock: a happy marriage.  3.   the legal  or  religious  ceremony that formalizes the decision of two people to live as a married couple, including the accompanying social festivities: to officiate at a marriage.  4.  a relationship in which two people have pledged themselves to each other in the manner of a husband and wife, without legal sanction: trial marriage.  5.  any close or intimate association or union: the marriage of words and music in a hit song.  6.  a formal agreement between two companies or enterprises to combine operations, resources, etc., for mutual benefit; merger.  7.  a blending or matching of different elements or components: The new lipstick is a beautiful marriage of fragrance and texture.   ...why would you bring something so immoral and irreligious into the picture?   What exactly is immoral and irreligious about Homosexuality?   You can call them butt-buddies, scissor-partners, bumchums etc. etc. but don't call them a married couple.   Can I, thanks. I will reference you when I need to be a bigot.

Don't change the topic i am talking about the topic on christianity don't bring in points or buddhism.  They are irrelevant and for your information i don't actually practice buddhism it's more like practicing noting :]  Points ain't inportant for me, i don't have so much free time to spam and multiply my accounts so that i could earn more points and be the top of this place.  Ah, that would be stupid ain't it :]  And also i am not pointing how inferior chrisitanity is i am just trying to show the difference between buddhism and christianiy. Unless all of you are trying to show me that you don't get what i mean.  And that you are ignorant oh perhaps we are in two different worlds with different perceptions.  With different beliefs and different lifestles.  I never get personal with anyone never unless he/she has been hostile to me like you :]  hmm i am not actually a buddhist nor a christian nor a atheist.  I am just ME !  If you want to criticise, please criticise me instead because i am the master who practices buddhism or christianiy or atheism.  If you wonder how bad i practice buddhism you got it right i just slack all day long as if i am an atheist.  Buddhism is great but i am not, you are just blatantly scolding the wrong thing at the wrong time.

I understand that people who are ignorant and uneducated may think that 'gayness' is contagious. Let me assure you, it isn't.  During childhood, everyone is laughed at for something.  No child will assume a man gave birth to them if the parents explain things the way all parents do. Did you assume your father gave birth to you until your mother said she did?  It is alright if he is gay too. There is nothing wrong with being gay. Their is something wrong with judging people and telling children that their gay parents are sinners and are going to hell.  There is something wrong with laughing at a child for having two parents who love them. Any orphan would gladly take two fathers or two mothers over no parents any day of the year.

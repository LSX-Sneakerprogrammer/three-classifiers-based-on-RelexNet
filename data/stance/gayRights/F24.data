"Marriage has been swallowed by religion."   Fine but it's still a religiouse thing. You're merely describing how it got that way. So my point still stands.   "Essentially, we chose to have marriage defined like that in a time when gays were oppressed. If we created it, why can't we change it?"   Because  we  (the majority) don't want to.  Also, I never said we couldn't. My point has always been that we don't have to.

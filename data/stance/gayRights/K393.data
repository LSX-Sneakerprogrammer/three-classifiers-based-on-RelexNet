I didn't say that it would affect anyones choice on if they are homosexual, or who they marrie.   I define a family as a mother and father who  love  each other(not just care for each other) and for their children.   Also, parents are more than just role models.  "There are thousands of kids in orphanages all over the world who would be a billion times better off being raised by 2 homosexuals than left in the orphanage!"   -says who!?   a billion times, please

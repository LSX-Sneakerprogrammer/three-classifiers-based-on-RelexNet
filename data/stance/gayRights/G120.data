I agree with you that words evolve with time as societies evolve.   So I guess the reason why the idea of marriage hasn't included gay unions is because societies haven't yet evolved to accept it.   Like I said before, I personally think of marriage as 2 people coming together with the intention of loving and being with each other for ever and to have children with each other etc.... Now, if some time in the future this picture comes up in my mind when I attend a gay wedding, then I don't even need a dictionary to tell me that a marriage is not just for straight people, the same way I didn't need a dictionary to tell me what a marriage is now.   Geriatrics marry young perky girls all the times, but don't ask me to accept that as a marriage. People do what they want and they're free to do  it  and I will not stop them, just don't ask me to accept that their idea of  it  is the same as my idea of  it . The word  "it"  can apply to many things, for example my idea of fun is going to a nightclub, others think it's fun to put a cat into a bag and hit the bag with a baseball bat...

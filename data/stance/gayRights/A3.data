Marriage is a concept that the state has got it's hands on. Marriage shouldn't be recognised under the state and marriage should be ONLY recognised under the eyes of God.  If a homosexual wants to get married, they can.  If a heterosexual wants to get married, they can.  But please don't beg for the state to comment how pretty you look together, the state shouldn't give a shit and not recognise any religious dogma.

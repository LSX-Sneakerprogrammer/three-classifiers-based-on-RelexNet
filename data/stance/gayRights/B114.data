your morals stand, outdated and archaic.   No it means that their morals can still be applied today.   homosexuality was rampant   Now if that isn't exxageration I don't know what is....   Do we still have a view of women as second class citizens, NO   Not many of these cultures did.   do we still have gladiatorial events where people are killed for amusement, NO. Do we still have widespread slavery,   Barbaric whites...  Gay people shouldn't impose their way of life to normal people. They can do what they want behind closed doors and maybe normal people can overlook it. But sitting their justifying their sinful acts is disgraceful and disgusting.

To put it another way, marriages are what societies are made of just like bricks are what buildings are made of.   You could still have society without marriage. And even if that weren't true, expanding the legal definition of marriage to allow for gays would not be a radical change. More akin to changing the texture of the bricks.   doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.   Was enforcing racial integration tyranny? No. There are times when tolerance is justified and times when it is not.   You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent.   No, I don't. But I think there are important similarities. Both skin color and sexual orientation are things that are part of ones identity. They cannot be changed. Neither makes a person inferior. Discrimination on the basis of either is logically unsound.   Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone.   Again they are not the same, just similar. But saying homosexuality is a behavior is being intentionally misleading. It's like saying shouting is "just a behavior" and therefore people should repress their anger at all times. It's completely impractical and utterly disconnected from reality.   You wouldn't say it's a good thing?   I was referring to homosexuality, not gay marriage. Being gay is neither good nor bad, it's neutral. Gay marriage, on the other hand,  is good , because it shows acceptance of behavior for which we should be showing acceptance.   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives.   Oh, wow, that's a pretty hardcore view. How is homosexuality anywhere near as bad as theft or murder? All I see is two people having sex. No harm done.   Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good.   Agreed. But gay sex is not one of them.   Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Hahaha. You're a funny guy.   Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   Well, they  are  born gay and they  can't  change, so that's just telling them the truth. Why should their conscience be troubled? That would only make sense if they bought into all that Christian nonsense.   ...waving the magic wand of neutrality...   You wouldn't take seriously a pamphlet from Neo-Nazis about how Jews are inferior people would you? Do you not understand the importance of neutrality?   Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.    Homosexuality is not a behavior, it's a sexual orientation. Gay sex is the behavior. We can and should repress bad behaviors, but gay sex is not a behavior bad enough to warrant repression.   you...deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul)   Morality does not come from anything supernatural. True morals are founded on logic, not on faith.

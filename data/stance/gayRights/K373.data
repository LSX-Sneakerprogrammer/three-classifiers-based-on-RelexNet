What about people that have think that god doesn't exist. Because they don't know that God doesn't exist. Can we decide  they  are right?   We can't decide these things for ourself based on other peoples beliefs. It is important to find these things out for ourselves.   How do you know that I don't know. Why can't I have faith and knowledge. The truth is you need both.

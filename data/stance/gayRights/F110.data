whilst god does not discriminate it says in the bible that man must not lie with man, this geeration seems to think that you are above the law of the bible and if this is so just look towards god and ask him 'am i allowed?' and the answer will be do as you will but ot for lust only for love   jacob  yet the systematic abuse of this freedom to sleep with whom and whoever you want for love was jesus lega cy and he said for give them father for they know not what they do and this was his last words as a man so do you really want to go behind gods back and show yourself as heathans he died for you once and when the second coming arrives he shall do it again if you caqn live with the shame for breaking of the covenants is your forty pieces of silver if your heart is breaking speak to jeasus if you have lost your faith speak to the lord but if you continue to be promiscuous without asking for forgiveness then you may have your money and laugh for the lords say it will not happen again

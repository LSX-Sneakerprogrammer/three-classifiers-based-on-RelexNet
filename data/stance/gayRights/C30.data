Again, spell out for me these rights for me. You can't do it ;) can you ;)   Marriage. That's the right. I already showed you the unanimous supreme court decision that says marriage is a right. When you then show that homosexuality is not a choice (which has been done scientifically), then you see that a  fundamental right  is being denied to a group of citizens.  Happy?

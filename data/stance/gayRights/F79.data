You might want to look more closely at what I said. Marriage was around  before Judaism . In fact it is dated back as far as we have records.   Once again, look more closely at what I said. That is Leviticus 20:13. I don't need to search the entire book to find something you don't believe. It amuses me that you didn't even look 4 lines higher, at 20:9 when you were demonstrating how well you know the bible.   "For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him."  Murder everyone, even small children, that has ever cursed at their parents? That would require the deaths of millions of 10 year olds. I assume you don't believe this. This is in fact said in the very same speech that your quote comes from.   We can even go all the way down to 20:18, where it clearly states that having sex with your wife while she is menstruating should be met with exile. Seems a little harsh considering it is possible for it to start during sex.   Then it states things that have been dis-proven. "If a man shall lie with his uncle's wife ... they shall die childless." (20:20), so even if you have shady morals regarding periods and child murder, you cannot claim that everything in this chapter is true.  All I am trying to say is that you are choosing passages to belief and passages to ignore. Since you cannot reasonably deny that, I would just hope that perhaps you'll start ignoring the bigotry and focusing on the love.

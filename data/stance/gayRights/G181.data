"Gay marriage can never be allowed!"  Need a list of all the countries in the world where gay marriage is now allowed? Boy, oh boy, you have your work cut out for you, trying to get them all to change their laws.  "No gay people." Too late. If god didn't want people to be gay, She wouldn't have created them.

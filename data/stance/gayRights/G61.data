Changing the definition of marriage effecting our legal system and society's view of marriage  does  have serious effects on us. If you view marriage as an important and serious institution and not something you would enter lightly without thought, then it's very important.   .  I suspect that the high rate of divorce is reflective of the light attitude people have of marriage today. It's nothing to be proud of, the goal should be to reverse this trend.

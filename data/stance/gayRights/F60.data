Why is it such a big deal about gay marriage?It's not like it's going to hurt our planet!I mean,the law isn't always right!It's just wrong to keep people from marrying others who they love.That's why our society's messed up,because of people being judge mental (there are also other reasons why are society is messed up)!You don't like being kept from the person you love,so why should they be kept from theirs'?Just be happy for them!Respect them and their' love!

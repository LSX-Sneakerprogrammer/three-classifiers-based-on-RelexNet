Let's just say that 5 years ago when I married my husband, homosexual marriage was legal... this would have had absolutely  no  effect on my choice to get married to him! Why do you say that there would be less families? How do you define a family? People who care for each other? There are thousands of kids in orphanages all over the world who would be a billion times better off being raised by 2 homosexuals than left in the orphanage!   I agree with you that we all need a male and female role model to look up to, but this does not have to be a biological parent!

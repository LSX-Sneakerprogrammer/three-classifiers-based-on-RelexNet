Homosexuals hurt the idea of family morales,   They hurt  your  idea of family morals. Not everyone's.     what if they were to adopt a kid, and all of his/her friends ask why they have 2dads, or 2 moms.   What is wrong with a capable couple giving an unwanted child a home, and their friends being curious about it?   The kids dont know, and honestly, so do I.   So you don't understand gay marriage thus it should be illegal? I don't understand religious fanaticism, but I'm not about to start a campaign to outlaw it.    And i agree with soccerstud, there are two sexes on this planet for a reason, if god wanted us to be gay then he would have only created one sex.   If God didn't plan for gays to exist, they wouldn't exist. Also, plenty of people don't really care what you think God wants or doesn't want, and you have realize not everyone is a Christian or chooses to follow all Christian ideals. By no means should a purely religious restriction  ever  be legalized.    Plus, you need 2 different sexes to make a normal family work, you need breast milk, you need sperm cells, you need egg cell, you need both the female and the male to function as a normal family, and in my opinion, gay married couples are not a normall functioning family.   This logic would make it illegal to be: an infertile married couple, a single parent, a married couple that adopted children, an elderly ,married couple, a married couple that is childfree by choice, or any other situation where a family consists of something other than a woman legally wed to a man and raising his kids.   Our role in society is no longer dictated by how or if we make babies. We're smarter than that now.

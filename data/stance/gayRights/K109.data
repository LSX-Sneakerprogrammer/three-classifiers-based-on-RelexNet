I just have to respond to one of your last statements:  "Until you can show me what human right is being denied, I don't know where else to go with this"  The right to life, LIBERTY, and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. It's in the Declaration of Independence. The denial of gay marriage is violating two basic human rights.

Why not? Everybody deserves the same rights. All this "adam and eve, not adam and steve" bullcrap has no place in the reasoning for any part of our legal system. There's a separation of church and state for a reason, religion shouldn't interfere in matters like this. What "sancticity of marriage" are people talking about? Marriage isn't necessarily a religious union between a man and a woman, why should it be? What makes it so special that it can't be between a man and a man? Or a woman and a woman?

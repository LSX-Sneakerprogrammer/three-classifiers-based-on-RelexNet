No no no. he said:   "P.S. Show me where in the Constitution it defines a family as a man and a woman"  I never said that the constitution defines what a family is. Because it doesn't say that, because the founders thought it was obvious.   And they obviously where strong in the Christian faith, which means they were against homosexuality but that is beside the point.  And I'm not mad so don't worry. (: &lt; see?, happy.

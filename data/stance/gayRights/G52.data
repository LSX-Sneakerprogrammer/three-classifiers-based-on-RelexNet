Yes, it should be legal.   - Homosexuality is a natural phenomenon; it's just that you're attracted more to the people of the same sex.  - Everyone has the right to be happy, so they deserve the things in which they find their happiness.  - On one hand we talk of equality, and on the other depriving homosexuals from it. Isn't it kind of ironical? I mean, so what if they're of the same sex? Aren't they entitled to love each other?  - No religious books (as far as I know) have ridiculed the whole notion of homosexuality. On the other hand, all of them have a common theme, that is, accepting people as they are, loving them as they are, and that everyone deserves to be happy.  - It has already been legalized in many countries. There are records of successful gay marriages; it isn't that only heterosexual marriages are successful.

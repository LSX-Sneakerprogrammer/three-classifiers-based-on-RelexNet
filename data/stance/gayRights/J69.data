Okay if you want to go this far, you should be asking should straights adopt, should single perants adopt! Why the heck does it matter the sexuality of the perants, I mean the only ones who should really worry about all of this is the perants and the kid. I think the kid would do anything to have someone, anyone to love them! Who are you to judge that?

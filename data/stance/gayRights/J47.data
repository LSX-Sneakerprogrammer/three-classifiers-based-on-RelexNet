A lot of little boys don't grow up without father figures. Should we take every kid away from single mothers?  The thing is, Jake, that your morals are not exactly... moral.  The judging of a couple's ability to raise a child is not up to you. Gay people have fine morals! They have jobs, they pay taxes, they participate in committed loving relationships, they love and respect their parents. In fact, aside from who they love, there is nothing more "immoral" about homosexuals than straight people at all.  Other than what your faith teaches you, what don't you like about homosexuality?
